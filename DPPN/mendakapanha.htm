<p>One of the questions set by King Videha to his five 
ministers, after having noticed a strange friendship between a ram and a dog. 
The ram was beaten by the elephant keepers because he took the grass from the 
stalls, while the dog had suffered at the hands of the cook for stealing meat 
from the kitchen. They met and agreed that the dog should go to the stalls and 
the ram to the kitchen, in order to avoid suspicion. The king saw this and set 
the question to his ministers. Only Mahosadha knew the solution and he told it 
to the others. The king was pleased and gave to each a chariot, a she mule and 
various other gifts. J.vi.349ff.</p>
