  <h2>Makhādeva-ambavana</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A mango grove in Mithilā where Makhādeva lived in 
meditation after retiring from household life (J.i.138 f.; vi. 95). </p>
<p>This grove existed even in the time of the Buddha, and 
during his stay there with Ānanda he preached the Makhādeva Sutta (M.ii.74).
</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.732; see also Mtu.iii.450) 
that the garden was originally planned by Makhādeva, and that other kings, from 
time to time, replaced trees which had died.</p>
