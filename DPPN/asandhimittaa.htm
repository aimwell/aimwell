<p>Chief queen of Dhammāsoka. He gave for 
her use one of the eight loads of water brought for him from Anotatta (Mhv.v.85; 
two says Sp.i.42). She was a faithful follower of the Buddha’s teaching and died 
in the thirtieth year of Asoka’s reign (Mhv.xx.2). When preparations were being 
made to take the branch of the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, she offered to the tree all 
kinds of ornaments and various sweet-scented flowers (Mbv.152).</p>
<p>Having learnt from the monks that the 
voice of the karavīka bird was like that of the Buddha, she had a karavīka given 
her by the king, and listened to his song. Thrilled with joy at the thought of 
the sweetness of the Buddha’s voice, she attained to the First Fruit of the Path 
(DA.ii.453; MA.ii.771).</p>
<p>She was called Asandhimittā because the 
joints in her limbs were visible only when she bent or stretched them (MT.136).</p>
<p>In a previous birth, when Asoka was born 
as a honey merchant and gave honey to the Pacceka Buddha, she was the maid who 
pointed out the honey-store to the Pacceka Buddha. She had then wished that she 
might become the queen consort of the King of Jambudīpa and be possessed of a 
lovely form with invisible joints. Mhv.v.59-60.</p>
