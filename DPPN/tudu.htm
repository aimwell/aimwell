<p>A Thera. He was the teacher of Culla 
Kokālika and, having become an Anāgāmī, was born as a Pacceka Brahma in the 
Brahma-world.  </p>
<p>When <a href="kokaalika.htm" title="ku/kokaalika.htm">Kokālika</a> was grievously ill, Tudu visited him and exhorted 
him to put his trust in <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a>. But Kokālika refused to accept 
his advice and drove him away. S.i.149; A.v.171; J.iv.245; AA.ii.852; SA.i.167f; 
SNA.ii.476.</p>
