<p> </b>(Sanskrit<i> kalpa):</i> 'world-period', an
inconceivably long space of time, an aeon. This again is subdivided into 4
sections:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>world-dissolution <i>(samvatta-kappa) </i>dissolving world), </li>
  <li>continuation of the chaos<i> (samvatta-ttháyí),</i> </li>
  <li>world-formation <i>(vivatta-kappa),
</i></li>
  <li>continuation of the formed world <i>(vivatta-ttháyí).</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;How long a world-dissolution will continue, how long
the chaos, how long the formation, how long the continuation of the formed
world, of these things; o monks, one hardly can say that it will be so many
years, or so many centuries, or so many millennia, or so many hundred thousands
of years&quot; (A.IV.156)</p>
<p>A detailed description of the 4 world-periods is given in
that stirring discourse on the all-embracing impermanence in A.VII.62.</p>
<p>The beautiful simile in S.XV.5 may be mentioned here:
&quot;Suppose, o monks, there was a huge rock of one solid mass, one mile long,
one mile wide, one mile high, without split or flaw. And at the end of every
hundred years a man should come and rub against it once with a silken cloth.
Then that huge rock would wear off and disappear quicker than a world-period.
But of such world-periods, o monks, many have passed away, many hundreds, many
thousands, many hundred thousands. And how is this possible? Inconceivable, o
monks, is this <a href="../s_t/samsaara.htm">samsára</a>, not to be discovered is any first beginning of
beings, who obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by craving, are hurrying and
hastening through this round of rebirths.&quot;</p>
<p>Compare here Grimm's German fairy-tale of the little
shepherd boy: 'In Farther Pommerania there is the diamond-mountain, one hour
high, one hour wide, one hour deep. There every hundred years a little bird
comes and whets its little beak on it. And when the whole mountain is ground
off, then the first second of eternity has passed.&quot;</p>
