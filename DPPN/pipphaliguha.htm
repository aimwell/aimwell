<p>A cave near Rājagaha, evidently a favourite haunt of Mahā 
Kassapa. Once when he lay there grievously ill, the Buddha visited him and 
cheered him by talking to him of the seven bojjhangas (S.v.79). On another 
occasion, Mahā Kassapa spent several days there in a trance, and when, at the 
end of that period, he entered Rājagaha for alms, Sakka, with Sujātā, waited for 
him in the guise of a weaver, and his wife gave him a meal. When Kassapa 
discovered this, he asked Sakka not to do such a thing again; but the Buddha 
heard Sakka’s song of triumph when his meal was accepted and praised him for his 
gift (Ud.iii.7; UdA.195f.; DhA.i.427f.; see also Ud.i.6). </p>
<p>On another occasion, when Kassapa was in the Pipphaliguhā, 
he had two novices waiting on him. One was lazy and a liar and took the credit 
for the work, all of which was done by the other. Kassapa admonished him, and he 
then set fire to the Elder’s hut and ran away (DhA.ii.19f). One day, as Kassapa 
sat in the Pipphaliguhā, he tried to contemplate the rising and falling of 
living beings, but the Buddha discouraged him, saying that such a task was 
beyond his abilities (DhA.i.258f). The goddess Lājā (q.v.), who had been born in 
Tāvatimsa as a reward for a meal which she once gave to Kassapa, attempted to 
sweep his cell in the Pipphaliguhā and to look after it, but Kassapa rejected 
her services. DhA.iii.6ff.</p>
