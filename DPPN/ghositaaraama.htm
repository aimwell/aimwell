  <h2>Ghositārāma</h2>

</ul>
<p>A monastery in Kosambī, built by Ghosita 
(Ghosaka, q.v.) for the use of the Buddha and the monks. The Buddha often stayed 
there during his visits to Kosambī and numerous incidents are mentioned in the 
books in connection with the monastery. It was because of a dispute between two 
monks of the Ghositārāma, one expert in the Vinaya and one in the Dhamma, that 
the first schism arose in the Order, driving the Buddha himself to seek quiet in 
the Pārileyyaka forest. Vin.i.337f; M.i.320; DhA.i.44ff; the Kosambī monks were 
evidently somewhat peculiar (see Vin.iv.197).</p>
<p>Even at other times the Buddha seems to 
have sought solitude in this forest during his sojourns at the Ghositārāma (See, 
e.g., S.iii.96f). It was here that the Buddha decreed the ukkhepaniyakamma for 
Channa, who refused to acknowledge and atone for his offences (Vin.ii.21f), and 
here that he laid down the procedure in that connection to be followed. 
Devadatta was at Ghositārāma when he first conceived the idea of using 
Ajātasattu for his own ends (Vin.ii.184f). The Buddha was there at the time and 
it is said that the devaputta Kakudha appeared before Mahā-Moggallāna to warn 
him of Devadatta’s schemes. The information was reported to the Buddha, who 
warned Moggallāna not to pass it on to others. The Buddha then proceeded to tell 
Moggallāna of the five kinds of teachers which appear in the world (A.iii.122f). 
Ānanda is several times spoken of as staying in the Ghositārāma, sometimes with 
the Buddha, sometimes alone. On one such occasion he asks the Buddha why women 
should suffer from certain disabilities as compared with men (A.ii.82). And 
again (A.iii.132f), what are the circumstances which conduce to ease (phāsuvihāra) 
in the case of monks? Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his 
attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the 
Buddha’s teachings? Once Ānanda visits (A.iv.37f), at her request, a nun living 
near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him. The mere sight of him causes 
her recovery, but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and 
makes her realise the truth (A.ii.144f). Among those who visit Ānanda at the 
Ghositārāma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned: Ghosita 
(S.iv.113), Unnābha (S.v.271f.), a householder, follower of the Ajivikas 
(A.i.217f.), and Bhaddaji (A.iii.202). Udāyī twice visits him there, once to ask 
for a description of consciousness (S.iv.169f.), and again to quote a verse 
uttered by Pañcālacanda devaputta and to ask Ānanda to explain it (A.iv.449). We 
find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by 
Ānanda (A.iv.426f.). Udāyī preached to large audiences at the Ghositārāma and 
was evidently appreciated, for we find Ānanda reporting it to the Buddha and 
being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with 
acceptance (A.iii.184f.). The Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ānanda 
to the monks at the Ghositārāma of his own accord (A.ii.156f.). Channa is 
several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the 
Ghositārāma. Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on 
him. A devoted householder, wishing to build a vihāra for him, asked him for a 
site. Vin.iii.155f; mention is made of other misdemeanours which he committed in 
order to have a fine vihāra (Vin.iv.47).</p>
<p>Channa started cutting down trees and 
other things, in order to clear the site, and this led to great uproar. On 
another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his 
colleagues and the Buddha chides him (Vin.iii.77, also iv.35f, 113. See also 
S.iii.132f). It was when Channa was at the Ghositārāma that Ānanda came, at the 
bidding of the monks, to inflict on him the brahmadanda (Vin.ii.292).</p>
<p>Among others mentioned as staying at the 
Ghositārāma are Mūsila, Savittha, Nārada, in the company of Ānanda (S.ii.115), 
Pindola Bhāradvāja — who converts Udena when the latter comes to see him 
(S.iv.110f.) and earns the Buddha’s praises for his attainments (S.v.224) — 
Sāriputta and Upavāna (S.v.76), and Bāhiya and Anuruddha (A.ii.239). Anuruddha 
is there at the time of the schism of the Kosambī monks but refuses to 
intervene. He indulges, instead, in his powers of clairvoyance and mention is 
made of a visit paid to him by the Manāpakāyika-devas (A.iv.262f).</p>
<p>Dāsaka and a number of other monks were 
once staying in the Ghositārāma; on learning that Khemaka lies ill in the 
Badarikārāma, one gāvuta away, the others send Dāsaka several times to and fro 
to ask various questions of Khemaka. In the end, Khemaka himself comes to them 
to solve their difficulties (S.iii.126f).</p>
<p>See also Kosambiya Sutta, Jāliya Sutta, 
Sandaka Sutta, Upakkilesa Sutta and Sekha Sutta, Dalhadhamma Jātaka, Kosambī 
Jātaka and Suripāna Jātaka, all preached while the Buddha was staying at the 
Ghositārāma.</p>
<p>Thirty thousand monks from the 
Ghositārāma, under the leadership of Urudhammarakkhita, were present at the 
foundation of the Mahā Thūpa at Anurādhapura. Mhv.xxix.34.</p>
