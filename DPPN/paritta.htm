  <h2>Paritta, Parittā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A collection of texts taken from the Khuddaka Pātha, the 
Anguttara Nikāya, the Majjhima Nikāya and the Sutta Nipāta, and recited on 
special occasions to ward off illness and danger. The word “paritta” means 
protection. The Milinda-Pañha (p.150f) gives a list of the chief Parittas: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ratana_sutta.htm" title="r/ratana_sutta.htm">Ratana Sutta</a>, </li>
  <li><a href="khandha_paritta_v_sam.htm" title="ku/khandha_paritta_v_sam.htm">Khandha-paritta,
  </a> </li>
  <li><a href="m5_mu.htm#Moraparitta" title="ma/m5_mu.htm#Moraparitta">Mora paritta, </a> </li>
  <li><a href="dhajagga_s.htm" title="d/dhajagga_s.htm">Dhajagga paritta, </a> </li>
  <li><a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Atānātiya paritta</a></li>
  <li><a href="angulimaala.htm" title="ay/angulimaala.htm">Angulimāla</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>(for particulars of these see s.v.; also 
  Dial.iii.185). </p>
<p>To these are generally added, in the extant collection of 
Parittas, </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="mangala_s.htm" title="ma/mangala_s.htm">Mangala Sutta</a> and </li>
  <li>the <a href="metta_sutta.htm" title="me_mu/metta_sutta.htm">Metta Sutta</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>The word paritta first occurs in the Culla Vagga 
(Vin.ii.110) in connection with the Khandha-paritta, which was allowed by the 
Buddha as a watch, a guard, a protection for oneself, for the use of the Order. 
The occasion of the delivery of this general injunction was the death of a monk 
from snake bite. The Milinda-Pañha states (see above) that the recital of the 
Paritta had the Buddha’s express sanction.</p>
<p>The collection of Parittas is, to this day, more widely 
known by the laity of Burma and Ceylon than any other Pāli book, and is 
generally used in times of danger or of sickness, both individual and national. 
Thus, Sena II., king of Ceylon, made the community of monks recite the Paritta, 
and by sprinkling the water charmed with Paritta he made the people free from 
illness, and so removed the danger of plague from the country.</p>
<p>He also decreed that this practice should continue every 
year (Cv.li.80).</p>
<p>Kassapa V. is said to have had a 
Paritta ceremony performed by the three fraternities of monks to protect his 
people from danger and plague and bad harvest (Ibid., lii.80).
</p>
<p>In the recent (1935) epidemic of malaria in Ceylon, monks 
were taken in carts through the badly affected areas reciting the Paritta and 
sprinkling water. The ceremony is held on most diverse occasions such as the 
inauguration of a new house, the starting of a journey, of a new business, etc. 
For a discussion on the Paritta see Dial.iii.180 ff.; also P.L.C.75f.</p>
<p>Bode says (Op. cit., 4) that in the days of King Anorata 
of Burma corrupt and cynical monks used the recital of the Paritta as an easy 
means of clearing man’s guilty conscience from all wrong doing, even from 
matricide.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa is mentioned (Cv.xxxvii.226) as having once 
attempted to compile a Parittatthakathā. Geiger (Cv. Trs.i.24, 3) calls this a 
commentary on the Paritta, but it is more probable that paritta is here used as 
an adjective, meaning short, concise, and that what is meant is a short or 
concise commentary on the Pitakas.</p>
