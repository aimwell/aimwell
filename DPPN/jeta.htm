<p>1. Jeta.-A prince. Owner of Jetavana, 
which he sold to Anāthapindika for eighteen crores. He then spent all that money 
on the erection of a gateway at the entrance, which he decorated with much 
grandeur (See Jetavana). Jeta is generally referred to as Jeta-Kumāra. According 
to the northern records he was the son of Pasenadi by the Ksatriya princess 
Varsikā (Rockhill: 48, n.1). He was killed by his half-brother Vidudabha for 
refusing to help him in his slaughter of the Sākyans (Ibid., 121). Several 
explanations (MA.i.50; UdA.56; KhpA.111, etc.) are given of his name: he was 
so-called either (1) because he conquered his enemies, or (2) because he was 
born at a time when the king had overcome his enemies, or (3) because such a 
name was considered auspicious for him (mangalakāmyatāya).</p>
<p>2. Jeta.-A Pacceka Buddha. M.iii.70.</p>
