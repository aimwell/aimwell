<h2>Sumangala Jātaka (No. 420)</h2>

<p>The <a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a> was once king 
of Benares and had a park keeper called <a href="sumangala.htm#10" title="s/sumangala.htm#10">Sumangala (10)</a>.  </p>
<p>A Pacceka Buddha came from 
<a href="nandamulapabbhara.htm" title="n/nandamulapabbhara.htm">Nandamūlapabbhāra</a> and took up his abode in the park. The king, seeing him as he 
went begging, invited him to the palace, fed him, and urged him to continue to 
stay in the park. The Pacceka Buddha agreed to do so, and the king told 
Sumangala to look after him. One day the Pacceka Buddha went away to a village, 
and, after an absence of some days, returned in the evening. Putting away his 
bowl and robe, he sat on a stone seat. Sumangala, looking in the park for some 
meat in order to feed some relations who had suddenly arrived, saw the Pacceka 
Buddha, and, taking him for a deer, shot him. The Pacceka Buddha revealed his 
identity and made Sumangala pull out the arrow. Sumangala was full of remorse, 
but the Pacceka Buddha died. Feeling sure that the king would never forgive him, 
Sumangala fled with his wife and children. After a year he asked a friend, a 
minister at court, to discover how the king felt towards him. The man uttered 
his praises in the king’s presence, but the king remained silent. This was 
repeated every year, and in the third year, knowing that the king now bore him 
no ill will, he returned to the king, who, after hearing from him how the 
accident had happened, forgave him. When asked why he had remained silent, the 
king replied that it was wrong for a king to act hastily in his anger.</p>
<p>Sumangala is identified with Ānanda. The story was related 
in connection with the admonition of a king. J.iii.439-44</p>
