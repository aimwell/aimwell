<p>Probably the actual name of the village 
in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married 
Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given 
to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi 
withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the 
two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the 
village was given back as part of her dowry. J.ii.403; iv.342; S.i.82ff; 
SA.i.110, 120f; AA.ii.833; DhA.iii.259.</p>
