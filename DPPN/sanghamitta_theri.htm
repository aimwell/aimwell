<p>Daughter of <a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a> and sister of
<a href="mahinda.htm" title="ma/mahinda.htm">Mahinda</a>. </p>
<p>She was born in <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a> and was married to Aggibrahmā&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
who later joined the Order&nbsp;&nbsp;- and had by him a son, Sumana. She was 
ordained in her eighteenth year together with Mahinda, her preceptor being 
Dhammapālā and her teacher Ayupālā. (Mhv.v.190 208; xiii.4, 11; DPv.vi.17; 
vii.18, 19; xv.77, 90; xvii.20; xviii.11, 25; Sp.i.51). </p>
<p>After her ordination and 
attainment of arahantship she lived in <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaliputta</a>, and, when 
<a href="anulaa.htm" title="ay/anulaa.htm">Anulā</a> and other 
women of Devānampiyatissa’s court at <a href="anuraadhapura.htm" title="ay/anuraadhapura.htm">Anurādhapura</a> wished to enter the Order,
<a href="devaanampiyatissa.htm" title="d/devaanampiyatissa.htm">Devānampiyatissa</a>, at Mahinda’s suggestion, sent an embassy, led by Arittha, to 
Asoka, asking that Sanghamittā might be sent to Ceylon, and with her a branch of 
the Bodhi tree for Anurādhapura. Asoka granted the request, and sent Sanghamittā, 
by sea, with eleven other nuns, carrying a branch of the Bodhi tree. On the way, 
when Nāgas surrounded the Bodhi tree, Sanghamittā frightened them away by 
assuming the form of a Garuda. She landed at <a href="jambukola.htm" title="j/jambukola.htm">Jambukola</a>, and, after her arrival 
at Anurādhapura, ordained Anulā and her companions. She lived at the Upāsikā-vihāra, 
and had twelve buildings erected there for the use of the nuns. Later, the king 
built for her the <a href="hatthalhaka_vih.htm" title="h/hatthalhaka_vih.htm">Hatthālhaka vihāra</a>. </p>
<p>She died at the age of fifty nine, in the ninth year of 
the reign of King Uttiya, and celebrations, lasting one whole week, were held in 
her honour throughout Ceylon. Her body was cremated to the east of the Thūpārāma 
near the (later) Cittasālā, in sight of the Bodhi tree, on a spot indicated by 
the Therī herself before her death. Uttiya had a thūpa erected over her ashes.
