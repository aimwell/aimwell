  <h2>Rāmāyana</h2>

</ul>
<p>Reference to this Epic Poem does not occur in the Pitaka or in the early 
books. </p>
<p>Even in the Commentaries reference thereto is rare (E.g., DA.i.76; MA.i.163, 
as Sītāharana), and then it is only condemned as “purposeless talk” (niratthakakathā).
</p>
<p>Only in the later Chronicles, such as the Cūlavamasa (E.g. Cv.lxiv.42), is 
the work actually mentioned by name. See also Rāma (5).</p>
