  <h2>Bandhanāgāra Jātaka (No.201) </h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in a poor family and 
supported his mother. Having provided him with a wife, much against his will, 
she died soon after. When his wife was with child, he wished to go away and 
became an ascetic, but his wife persuaded him to stay. On her second conception 
he ran away and, becoming an ascetic, rejoiced in his freedom from the bonds of 
wife and family.</p>
<p>The story was related when some monks reported to the 
Buddha that a gang of thieves had been taken captive by <b>Pasenadi</b> and put 
in chains. No chains were stronger than those of passion, said the Buddha.
</p>
<p>J.i.139ff.; cp. <b>Bandhana Sutta</b> (2); the verses 
given in the Jātaka are also found there.</p>
