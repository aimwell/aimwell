<p>1. Ayoniso (or Vitakkita) Sutta.-A 
certain monk staying in a forest tract in Kosala was occupied with evil and 
wrongful thoughts. The deva of the forest, desiring his welfare, drew near and 
admonished him to give up his muddled ways and fix his thoughts on the Buddha, 
the Dhamma and the Sangha (S.i.203).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Ayoniso Sutta.-In one who practices 
unsystematic attention, sensual desires arise afresh and grow; similarly 
malevolence, sloth and torpor. In him the satipatthānā fade away. The reverse 
happens in the case of the man who practises systematic attention. S.v.84.</p>
