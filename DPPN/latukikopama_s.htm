  <h2>Latukikopama Sutta</h2>

<p>Preached to Udāyī (Mahā Udāyi, says the Commentary) in a 
wood near Āpana. Udāyī recalls the rules made by the Buddha regarding the hours 
for meals, how such rules were added to, until, in the end, any meal out of 
hours was forbidden; and he mentions how, though at first these rules involved 
hardship, in the end they were very helpful in dispelling unhappy states of 
consciousness and in implanting happy ones. The Buddha agrees, but adds that 
many people are foolish, and consider such sacrifices insignificant, growing 
discontented when asked to make them. But this insignificant thing develops into 
a bond strong enough to hold them fast. Some people are like quails caught in 
traps, unable to escape from their bonds, others like mighty elephants, bursting 
their bonds and going where they wish. Thus there are four types of individuals, 
differing according as to whether they are attached to their bonds or detached 
from them. M.i.447-56; MA.ii.656-60.</p>
