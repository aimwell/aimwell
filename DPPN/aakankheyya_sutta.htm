<p><b>1. Ākankheyya Sutta</b>.-The sixth sutta of 
the Majjhima Nikāya, preached at Jetavana.  </p>
<p>A monk must conform to the sīla, the 
pātimokha and the sikkhāpadas, whatever be his yearnings, whether to be beloved 
of his fellows, to be given robes etc., to gain the four jhānas, to make an end 
of dukkha or to be possessed of such powers as dibbacakkhu, etc. (M.i.33-6)  </p>
<p>This sutta is often mentioned (E.g., DA.i.50; MA.i.13) as an example of a discourse 
preached by the Buddha of his own accord (attano ajjhāsayen'eva).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ākankkheyya Sutta.</b>-Preached to the 
monks at Jetavana on the ambitions that should stir a monk’s heart. A.v.131-3.</p>
