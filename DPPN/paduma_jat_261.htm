<h2>Paduma Játaka (No. 261)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once the son of a rich merchant in 
Benares. In the town was a tank tended by a leper who had lost his nose. One 
feast day the Bodhisatta with his two brothers went to the tank to fetch some 
lotuses. The brothers tried to flatter the leper, thereby making him angry, but 
the Bodhisatta, being honest, was given a whole bunch of lotuses.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Ananda. Some monks 
once wandered all over the Lotus street to find some lotuses to offer at the 
Ananda bodhi (q.v.). But they found none, and Ananda, hearing of it, went 
himself to the Lotus street and returned with many handfuls of blue lotus. The 
incident was reported to the Buddha who related the story of the Játaka.
