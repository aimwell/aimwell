<p>An Elder who lived in Kassakalena. In 
his begging village was an upāsikā who looked after him like her own son. One 
day the Elder, while on his begging rounds, heard her giving orders to her 
daughter regarding his food. He realised that the woman was undergoing great 
privations in order to provide him with luxuries, and feeling that he was 
unworthy of such attention, went back to Kassakalena and sat down on his couch, 
determined not to rise till he had become an arahant. During the night his 
object was achieved and the deva in the cave uttered his praise in song. The 
following morning he went as usual for his alms and the upāsikā knew that he had 
realised his quest (DA.iii.790-1).</p>
<p>He is also called Mahāmitta. VbhA.279.</p>
