<p>One of the Valāhaka devas (q.v.). See also Pajjuna. One of 
them once visited an arahant Thera in the Himālaya, and, revealing his identity, 
said that he could cause rain at will. The Elder wished to test this claim, but 
even before he could enter his hut the deva sang a song, raised his hand, and 
rain fell to a distance of three leagues. </p>
<p>There are causes for rain: the power of nāgas, of supannas, 
of devas, of an Act of Truth, of change of weather, of Māra, and of iddhi power.
