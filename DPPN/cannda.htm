<p>1. Cannda.-A headman (gāmani) of 
Sāvatthi. He came to see the Buddha at Jetavana and asked him why some people 
earned the reputation of being wrathful and others of being kindly. The Buddha 
explained that the one man gives way to passion, resentment and illusion; 
therefore, others harass him; he shows vexation and comes to be called wrathful. 
The other shows opposite qualities and is called kindly (sūrata) (S.iv.305). The 
Commentary says (SA.iii.99) that the name Canda was given to the gāmani by the 
Elders who compiled the texts.</p>
<p>2. Cannda.-See Pañcālacanda.</p>
