<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic who, 
at the moment of his death, said “neither conscious nor unconscious.” His chief 
disciple interpreted these words, but the others would not believe him until the 
Bodhisatta descended from the Brahma-world in order to uphold his explanation.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to an 
explanation given by Sāriputta at Sankassa (J.i.473).</p>
<p>This Jātaka is probably also called the 
Anangana Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
