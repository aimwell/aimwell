<p>1. Kālaka.-A setthi of Sāketa. His son 
was the husband of Cūla-Subhaddā (q.v.) and therefore son-in-law of 
Anāthapindika. Kālaka was a follower of the Niganthas. When the Buddha visited 
Sāketa, at the request of Cūla-Subhaddā, Kālaka listened to his sermon and 
became a sotāpanna. He gave his park, the Kālakārāma, to the Buddha, and built a 
vihāra there after removing, by force, the Niganthas, who were in possession.
</p>
<p>AA.ii.482f; but see DhA.iii.465f, where 
the setthi’s name is given as Ugga of Uggapura; see also Dvy.402, where the name 
of the city is Pundavardhana and that of Anāthapindika’s daughter Sumāgadhā.</p>
<p>2. Kālaka. Senāpati of King Yasapāni of 
Benares, a previous birth of Devadatta. The story is given in the Dhammaddhaja 
Jātaka. J.ii.186ff</p>
<p>3. Kālaka.-See Ayya-Kālaka.</p>
<p>4. Kālaka.-See A.v.164, Sutta No. 
lxxxvii. Is Kālaka here a proper name or a generic name (Kālaka-bhikkhu) meaning 
a wicked monk?</p>
<p>I am inclined to take it as the latter. 
See Kālaka(-bhikkhu) Sutta.</p>
