<h2>Mahāsammata</h2>
<p>A king who lived in the beginning of this present age. </p>
<p>The 
Pāli Chronicles (Mhv.ii.1ff.; Dpv.iii.1ff.; MT. 122ff.; also J.ii.311; iii.454, 
etc.) mention him as the original ancestor of the Sākiyan family, to which the 
Buddha belonged, and gives a list of the dynasties from his day to the time of 
the Buddha, to prove that the line was “unbroken.” </p>
<p>Mahāsammata belonged to the 
Solar Race and is identified with the Bodhisatta, who was born among men after 
sojourn in the Brahma worlds (MT. 121 f). He was called Mahāsammata, because, on 
the arising of wickedness in the world, he was chosen by the people (sannipatitvā 
samaggajātehi mahājanchi sammannitvā kato Mahāsammato; MT.122; cp. D.iii.92f.; 
Mtu.i.248; DhSA. 390, 392) to show indignation against and disapproval of those 
worthy of blame. In return for his services, he was given a portion of their 
harvest. </p>
<p>It is said (J.iv.192) that in the dynasty of Mahāsammata 
the idea of meting out punishments, such as torture, fining, expulsion, was 
unknown. These were invented later <b>with the advance of civilisation!</b> </p>
<p>The Vimānavatthu Commentary (p.15) explains that 
Mahāsammata is the name given in the sacred books (sāsane) for Manu. Some, at 
least, of the Ceylon kings traced their descent from Mahāsammata. See, e.g., 
Cv.xlvii.2.</p>
