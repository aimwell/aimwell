<p>A town (nagara) near <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. When the Buddha found that 
he could not persuade the Kosambī monks to refrain from quarrelling, he left 
Kosambī alone and unattended, and passing through
<a href="balakalonakarama.htm" title="b/balakalonakarama.htm">Bālaklonakāragāma</a> 
and <a href="pacinavamsamigadaya.htm" title="pa/pacinavamsamigadaya.htm">Pācīnavamsadāya</a>, went to Pārileyyaka, where he stayed at the foot of 
<a href="bhaddasaala.htm#4" title="b/bhaddasaala.htm#4">Bhaddasāla</a> in the 
<a href="rakkhita_vanasanda.htm" title="r/rakkhita_vanasanda.htm">Rakkhitavanasanda</a>. There a certain elephant who, finding 
communal life distasteful, had left his herd, waited on the Buddha, ministering 
to all his needs. From Pārileyyaka the Buddha went on to 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> (Vin.i.352f.; 
S.iii.95; Ud.iv.5; J.iii.489; M.i.320). </p>
<p>This was in the tenth year after the Enlightenment (BuA., 
p.3). The Commentaries (E.g., DhA.i.48ff.; iv.26 ff. UdA.250f.; see Thomas, op. 
cit., 117 n ) say that the elephant’s name was Pārileyya, and describe in vivid 
detail the perfect manner in which he looked after the Buddha, omitting nothing, 
even to the extent of finding hot water for his bath. There was also there a 
monkey who offered the Buddha a honeycomb. Soon after, the monkey fell on a tree 
stump and died and was born in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>.  </p>
<p>Later, when Ānanda came with five 
hundred others to invite the Buddha to return to Sāvatthi, Pārileyyaka provided 
them all with food. He died of a broken heart when the Buddha left the forest, 
and was born in Tāvatimsa in a golden palace, thirty leagues high, where he came 
to be known as Pārileyyaka devaputta.</p>
<p>This elephant is identified with the elephant of the

Jātaka</a>. J.iv.314.</p>
