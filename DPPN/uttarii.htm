<p>A nun. She continued going on her rounds 
for alms until she reached the age of one hundred and twenty. One day, when 
returning from her round, she met a monk in the street and gave him all she had 
in her bowl. On the second and third days she did likewise. On the fourth day, 
as she was going her round, she met the Buddha in a very crowded spot. She 
stepped back and, while doing so, she trod on the skirt of her robe which had 
slipped down. Unable to keep her feet, she fell down. The Buddha came up and 
spoke to her. She became a Sotāpanna. DhA.iii.110-11.</p>
