  <h2>Janapada Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached to the monks at Desakā in the 
Sumbhā country. Supposing the fairest maiden in all the countryside were to 
dance and sing in public, and a man were told that if he carried a bowl brimful 
of oil through the crowd he would win the maiden, but that if he spilt one 
single drop he would lose his head, that man would not turn his attention to 
anything else or grow slack in his efforts. In the same way should monks 
cultivate mindfulness relating to the body (S.v.169f).</p>
<p>This sutta seems also to have been 
called the Janapadakalyāni Sutta. E.g., J.i.393f.</p>
