<p><b>1. Sīha. </b>A <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavi</a> general of 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. He was a 
follower of the <a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Niganthas</a>. When the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> visited Vesāli, Sīha, having heard 
reports of his greatness, wished to see him, but 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a> dissuaded 
him, saying that <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a> denied the result of actions and was not worth a visit. 
But in the end Sīha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. 
Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of 
preaching wrong doctrines, Sīha declared himself the Buddha’s follower. The 
Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms 
to any Niganthas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Sīha honour 
the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the 
next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Niganthas went about Vesāli 
crying that Sīha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his 
monks and that the food had been accepted. This was the occasion for the 
formulation of the rule that no monk should eat flesh where he has reason to 
believe that the animal had been specially killed for him (Vin.i.233f.; 
A.iv.179f.; see also the <a href="telovaada_jat_246.htm" title="t/telovaada_jat_246.htm">Telovāda Jātaka</a>).</p>
<p>Sīha was, at one time, one of the most famous patrons of 
the Niganthas, the others being <a href="upaali.htm#Gahapati" title="u/upaali.htm#Gahapati">Upāligahapati</a> of 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>, and <a href="vappa.htm" title="va/vappa.htm">Vappa</a>, the 
Sākiyan 
of <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> (AA.ii.751).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.38f; iv.79f ) contains two 
discussions, in more or less identical terms, in which Sīha asks the Buddha if 
it is possible to show the visible results of giving. The Buddha, by means of a 
counter question, elicits from Sīha that the giver has his reward in this world 
itself, and in the end Sīha acknowledges that he has experienced the benefits 
which the Buddha set forth.</p>
<p>Sīha had a niece, <a href="siiha_therii.htm" title="s/siiha_therii.htm">Sīhā</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sīha Thera. </b>He was born in the family of a rājā 
in the Malla country and visited the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a sermon 
suitable to his temperament, and he entered the Order. He lived in the forest in 
meditation, but his thoughts were distracted. The Buddha, seeing this, went 
through the air and spoke to him alone, asking him to persevere. Thus incited, 
he strove hard and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>He was once a kinnara on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and 
seeing Atthadassī Buddha journeying through the air, he stood still, gazing at 
him with clasped hands. The Buddha alighted and sat under a tree, where the 
kinnara offered him flowers and sandalwood. Sīha was three times king, under the 
name of Rohinī (ThagA.i.179). He is probably identical with Candanapūjaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.165.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sīha. </b>A <a name="novice">novice</a> who entered the Order at the age 
of seven and was a great favourite among the monks for his charm. He was much 
liked by the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. He was a student under Nāgita, and was with him when the 
Buddha once stayed in Vesāli. Seeing a great number of people coming to visit 
the Buddha, he informed Nāgita of this, and, with his permission, went to tell 
the Buddha. This led to the preaching of the <a href="mahali_s.htm" title="maha/mahali_s.htm">Mahāli Sutta</a> (D.i.151). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa 
adds (DA.i.310) that Nāgita was fat and lazy and that most of his work was done 
by Sīha, who was his sister’s son.</p>
