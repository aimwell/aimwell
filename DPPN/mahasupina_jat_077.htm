<h2>Mahāsupina Jātaka (No. 77)</h2>
<p>Pasenadi, king of Kosala, had, one night, sixteen bad 
dreams, and his brahmins, on being consulted, said that they presaged harm 
either to his kingdom, his life, or his wealth, and prescribed all manner of 
sacrifices in order to avert the danger (It is perhaps this sacrifice which is 
referred to at S.i.75). </p>
<p>Mallikā, the king’s wife, heard of this and suggested that 
the Buddha should be consulted. The king followed her advice, and the Buddha 
explained the dreams. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first dream was of wild bulls entering the royal 
  courtyard to fight but retiring after roaring and bellowing. This, said the 
  Buddha, meant that, in future, when wicked kings rule, rain clouds will 
  gather, but there will be no rain. </li>
  <li>The second dream was of trees and shrubs sprouting from 
  the earth which flowered and bore fruit when only about one span high. This 
  foretold a time when men would be short lived owing to their lusts. 
  </li>
  <li>In the third dream cows sucked calves which were hardly 
  a day old. This showed that, in the future, the young would refuse respect to 
  the old. </li>
  <li>The fourth dream was of sturdy draught oxen standing 
  by, while young steers tried to draw loads. This signified a time when the 
  administration of affairs will be entrusted to the young and inexperienced, 
  while the wise and old stand by. </li>
  <li>The fifth dream was of a horse which ate from two 
  mouths, one on either side of its body, which foretold a time when the king’s 
  justices will take bribes from contending parties and give themselves to 
  corruption. </li>
  <li>The sixth dream was of people holding a very valuable 
  golden bowl and asking a jackal to stale therein. This shows that, in the 
  future, kings will exalt the low born and noble maidens will be mated with 
  upstarts. </li>
  <li>The seventh dream was of a man holding a rope which he 
  trailed at his feet, while a she jackal kept on eating it. This foretold a 
  time when women will lose their sense of modesty and behave badly. 
  </li>
  <li>In the eighth dream was a big pitcher at the palace 
  gates filled with water and surrounded by empty ones. This foretold a time 
  when kings will be poor and set the whole country working for them, the people 
  being left in extreme poverty. </li>
  <li>The ninth dream was of a deep pool with sloping banks 
  overgrown with lotus. Men and beasts entered the pond; the middle was muddy, 
  but at the edges was crystal water. This meant that in the future there would 
  be unrighteous kings oppressing the people, who would leave the capital and 
  take refuge in the frontier districts. </li>
  <li>The tenth dream was of rice cooking in a pot, which 
  rice, instead of cooking evenly, remained in three parts: some sodden, some 
  raw, some well cooked; this showed that in the future men of all classes, even 
  brahmins and sages, will be wicked, the very forces of nature will be against 
  them, and their harvest will be spoiled. </li>
  <li>The eleventh dream was of men bartering butter milk for 
  precious sandal wood, and presaged a time when the Dhamma would decay and its 
  votaries clamour for money and gifts. </li>
  <li>The twelfth dream was of empty pumpkins sinking in the 
  water; the world will be reversed: the low born will become great lords and 
  the noble sink into poverty. </li>
  <li>In the thirteenth dream solid blocks of rock floated in 
  the water; nobles and wise men will be scorned while upstarts shall have their 
  own way. </li>
  <li>In the fourteenth dream tiny frogs chewed huge snakes 
  and ate them; a time will come when men, because of their lusts, will become 
  the slaves of their wives and be ruled by them. </li>
  <li>The fifteenth dream was of a wicked village crow 
  attended by mallards; kings will arise, ignorant and cowardly, who will rise 
  to power, not their peers, but their footmen, barbers, and the like; nobles 
  will be reduced to waiting on these upstarts. </li>
  <li>In the sixteenth dream goats chased panthers, devouring 
  them; the lowborn will be raised to lordship and nobles will sink into 
  obscurity and distress; when the latter plead for their rights, the king’s 
  minions will have them cudgelled and bastinadoed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having thus explained the dreams, the Buddha told Pasenadi 
a story of the past. A king of Benares, named Brahmadatta, had dreams similar to 
those of Pasenadi. When he consulted the brahmins, they began to prepare 
sacrifices. A young brahmin protested, saying that animal sacrifice was against 
the teaching of the Vedas, but they would not listen. The Bodhisatta, who was a 
hermit in the Himālaya, possessed of insight, became aware of what was 
happening, travelled through the air and took his seat in the park. There he was 
seen by a young brahmin, who brought the king to the park. The Bodhisatta heard 
the king’s dreams and explained them to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Ānanda was the king and Sāriputta the young brahmin.
