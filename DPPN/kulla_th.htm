<p>An arahant. He was a landowner in 
Sāvatthi and joined the Order after hearing the Buddha preach. But he was often 
seized by fits of lustful passion, and even when, following the Buddha’s 
instructions, he meditated in the charnel field, he could not control the 
tendency. The Buddha himself went with him and bade him mark the putrefaction 
and dissolution of dead bodies around him. He attained first jhāna, developing 
which he won arahantship (ThagA.i.444f). </p>
<p>The Theragāthā verses (393-8) ascribed 
to him are a record of this experience.</p>
