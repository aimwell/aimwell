<p>One of the four sons of the Nāga-king 
Dhatarattha and his queen Samuddajā, the others being Sudassana, Bhūridatta and 
Subhaga. When Kānārittha heard that his mother was a human, wishing to test her 
one day while drinking her milk, he assumed a serpent’s form and struck her foot 
with his tail. Samuddajā threw him on to the ground with a shriek and 
accidentally struck his eye with her nail, thereby blinding him. Henceforth he, 
whose name had been Arittha, was known as Kānārittha (J.vi.168). When, after 
Bhūridatta’s disappearance (see Bhūridatta Jātaka) from the Nāga-world, his 
brothers set out to search for him, Kānārittha was sent to the world of the 
gods, for he was so cruel by nature that they knew that if he went to the world 
of men he would destroy it by fire (J.vi.190). When, after his search, he 
returned to the Nāga-world, he was appointed doorkeeper of Bhūridatta’s 
sick-room; there, seeing Subhaga dragging a brahmin roughly into the Nāga-world, 
he prevented him from ill-treating the man and told him of the greatness of all 
brahmins, illustrating his words with various stories (J.vi.197; details see 
pp.200ff). It is said that in his immediately preceding birth, he had been a 
brahmin, well-versed in sacrificial lore. Bhūridatta heard (from his bed) 
Arittha’s undue praise of brahmins and refuted his statements (J.vi.205ff).</p>
<p>Kānārittha is identified with 
Sunakkhatta (J.vi.219).</p>
