<p><b>1. Rukkha Sutta.</b> Of those who sit at the foot of trees, he who does so 
because he desires seclusion and his needs are few, is the best. A.iii.219.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Rukkha Sutta.</b> On four kinds of trees and four corresponding kinds 
of men. Some men are evil and their company is evil, some are good and their 
company is evil, etc. A.ii.109.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Rukkha Sutta.</b> Just as a tree, which leans towards the east, falls 
to the cast when cut down, so does a monk who cultivates the Eightfold Path 
incline to Nibbāna. S.v.47.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Rukkha Sutta.</b> Mighty trees, grown from tiny seeds, overspread other 
trees and kill them; so are householders destroyed by their lusts. There are 
five hindrances (nīvarana) that overspread the heart; the seven bojjhangas are 
not like them. S.v.96f.</p>
