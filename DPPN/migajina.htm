<p>An ascetic in Himavā. When Mahājanaka renounced the world 
he was followed by a great crowd, and there was danger that he might be turned 
from his noble purpose. Mīgājina, who had just risen from an ecstatic trance, 
saw this and, appearing before him, exhorted him to be earnest and determined. 
(J.vi.58ff) </p>
<p>Migājina is identified with Moggallāna. J.vi.68.</p>
