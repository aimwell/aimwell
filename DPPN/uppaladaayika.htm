<p>Thirty-one kappas ago she was the wife 
of the Khattiya Aruna of Arunavatī. One day, being filled with anguish that she 
had not done any good deed which would bring her a happy condition of rebirth, 
she begged her husband for a holy recluse on whom she could wait. Her wish was 
granted, and she gave to the recluse a bowl of excellent food and perfume, the 
whole covered with a large robe. As a result, she was born in Tāvatimsa and 
became for a thousand times the consort of the king of the devas. Her body was 
always of the hue of the lotus and she had all womanly beauty. In her last birth 
she was born in a Sākyan family and joined the Bodhisatta’s court at the head of 
a thousand women. Later, she left the world and became an arahant, seven days 
after joining the Order (Ap.ii.601-3). A set of verses in which she sang the 
praises of the Buddha, appear at the end of the Apadāna account. She is perhaps 
to be identified with Soma Therī.</p>
