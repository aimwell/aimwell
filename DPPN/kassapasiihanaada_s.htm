  <h2>Kassapasīhanāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The eighth sutta of the <a href="diigha_nikaaya.htm" title="d/diigha_nikaaya.htm">Digha Nikāya</a>. It 
consists of a dialogue between the Buddha and <a href="acela_kassapa.htm" title="am/acela_kassapa.htm">Acela-Kassapa</a> on 
self-mortification, and contains an account of some of the practices prevalent 
among the <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ājīvakas</a>. </p>
<p>The Buddha claims that the insight and self-control and self-mastery of the 
arahant are much harder of attainment than the merely physical practices of the 
ascetics, which are far more evident to the vulgar. The Buddha states that 
self-mortification is an actual hindrance to spiritual development, for it turns 
a man’s mind from more essential matters.</p>
<p>It is said that at the conclusion of the 
Sutta, Kassapa entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant. 
D.i.161-77.</p>
