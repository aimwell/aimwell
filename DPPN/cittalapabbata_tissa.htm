<p>A Thera. Seized by discontent, he asked 
his teacher’s consent to leave the Order. The latter, seeing his upanissaya, 
asked him to build a hut for his use, not omitting his religious duties the 
while. Tissa consented, and, having finished the hut and spread the bed, he 
informed his teacher, who said, “Now that you have done this work with such 
great pains, why not spend one night in the hut?” Tissa did so, and during the 
night, while reflecting on what he had accomplished, his heart was filled with 
joy and he became an arahant. AA.i.26f.</p>
