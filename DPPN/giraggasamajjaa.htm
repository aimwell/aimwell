<p>A festival held from time to time (kālānukālam) 
in Rājagaha. (Perhaps elsewhere as well. The BuA. p.102 says it was an annual 
festival held all over Jambudīpa and was as old as Dīpankara Buddha; see also 
J.iii.538). It was held in the open air in the afternoon and was attended by all 
people of all grades of society from Anga and Magadha. Special seats were 
prepared for the more eminent of the audience, and the festivities seem to have 
consisted chiefly of nautch dances (SNA.i.326). According to the Vinaya accounts 
(Vin.ii.107f, 150; iv.85, 267) there were also singing and music, and the 
festival was attended not only by laymen, but also by members of religious 
orders, for otherwise it is unlikely that the Sattarasavaggiyas and the 
Chabbaggiyas would have been there. Food was provided as well as amusements. 
Buddhaghosa (Sp.iv.831) explains the name of the festival thus: giraggasamajjo 
ti girimhi aggasamajjo girissa vā aggadese sammajo, and tells us that it was 
announced for seven days before its commencement, and was held on level ground 
under a shadow of a hill and outside the city. Perhaps it was originally a pagan 
religious festival, a survival of old exogamic communistic dancing (See 
Dial.i.7, n.4; VT.iii.71, n.3).</p>
<p>It was at a Giraggasamajjā that 
Sāriputta and Moggallāna decided to leave the world (DhA.i.73f.; AA.i.89, etc.).</p>
<p>The Sanskrit equivalent is 
Girivaggu-samāgama. AvS.ii.24.</p>
