<p>A juggler (nātaka) who was among 
  those who tried, but without success, to make Mahā Panāda laugh. </p>
<p>He entered 
  with his troupe into a blazing fire and there remained until it burnt out. The 
  people sprinkled the ashes with water, and Pandukanna and his troupe rose up, 
  wearing flowers and dancing. J.iv.324.</p>
