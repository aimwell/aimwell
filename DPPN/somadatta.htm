<p><b>5. Somadatta.</b>-A brahmin of 
Sāvatthi. He once played dice with another brahmin, Soma, and won the latter’s 
possessions, including his upper garment and signet ring. When Soma said he 
could not walk home barefoot, nor face his family without his ring, Somadatta 
returned his winnings and the two became great friends. Somadatta was later 
sentenced to death for repeated adultery. When Soma discovered this he offered 
his life instead and was killed. He was reborn as a deva and took Somadatta to 
the deva world for a week, sending him back with a wish conferring gem. Later 
Somadatta too was born near Soma. Ras.i.46f.</p>
