<p>A seaport in the country of <a href="bharu.htm" title="b/bharu.htm">Bharu</a> (J.iv.137). </p>
<p>Mention is made of merchants going by sea from there to 
<a href="suvannabhuumi.htm" title="s/suvannabhuumi.htm">Suvannabhūmi</a> (e.g., J.iii.188). Bharukaccha was the residence of 
<a href="vaddhamaataa_theri.htm" title="va/vaddhamaataa_theri.htm">Vaddhamātā 
Therī</a> (ThigA.171) and <a href="malitavambha_th.htm" title="ma/malitavambha_th.htm">Malitavambha Thera</a> (ThagA.i.211). </p>
<p>In the Mahā-niddesa (MNid.i.155; 
see also Mil.331), Bharukaccha is mentioned in a list of places to which men 
went for trade. Vijaya lived there for three months before sailing for Ceylon. 
Dpv.ix.26; the Dvy. (586) says the city was founded by Bhiru, one of the three 
people who escaped from the kingdom of Sikhandi, the parricide ruler of Sauvīra, 
when this was destroyed by a heavy fall of sand, following on the murder of 
Rudrāyana, king of Roruka. Bharukaccha is, according to this account, a 
corruption of Bhīrukaccha (Marsh of Bhiru). But Brahmanized tradition ascribes 
its foundation to the sage Bhrgu. It is identical with Barygaza of Ptolemy and 
the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea.</p>
<p>Bharukaccha is the modern Broach in Kathiawar. The people 
of Bharukaccha are called Bharukacchakā. E.g., DhSA.305.</p>
