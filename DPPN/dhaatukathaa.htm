<p>One of the seven books of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. It seems to have been designed as a supplement to the Dhammasangani, and 
discusses, chiefly, the mental characteristics found in converted and earnest 
persons. It is divided into fourteen sections and possesses a Commentary by 
Buddhaghosa. Published by the P.T.S.</p>
<p>The Sarvāstvādins call the Dhātukathā 
the Dhātukāyapada. There seems to have existed in Ceylon another work called the 
Mahādhātukathā, claimed by the Vitandavādins as an Abhidhamma-work, but rejected 
by the orthodox as uncanonical. DhSA.4.</p>
