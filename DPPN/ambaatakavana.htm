<p>A grove at Macchikāsanda, belonging to 
Cittagahapati. Being pleased with the Elder Mahānāma of Macchikāsanda, Citta 
invited him to a meal, and after listening to his discourse, gave the grove to 
the Order. At the dedication of the gift the earth trembled. Later he built a 
splendid monastery there, the Ambātakārāma, for the use of monks from all parts 
(AA.i.209; DhA.ii.74). It became the residence of large numbers of monks, and 
discussions often took place there between Cittagahapati and the resident 
bhikkhus (S.iv.281-97).</p>
<p>Among eminent Elders who visited the 
place were </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Isidatta of Avanti (who answered 
  Citta’s questions regarding the reason for the existence of various views in 
  the world) (S.iv.283-8), </li>
  <li>
  <p>Mahaka (who, by his magic powers, 
  produced rain and thunderstorms and later showed a special miracle to Citta) 
  (S.iv.288-91), </li>
  <li>
  <p>Kāmabhū (who discoursed to Citta on 
  various topics) (S.iv.291-5), and </li>
  <li>
  <p>Godatta (S.iv.295-7). </li>
  <li>
  <p>The Elder Lakuntaka Bhaddiya also 
  lived there, in solitude, wrapt in meditation (Thag.v.466).</li>
</ul>
<p>Behind Ambataka was Migapathaka, which 
was Citta’s tributary village (SA.iii.93) (v.l. Ambālavana).</p>
