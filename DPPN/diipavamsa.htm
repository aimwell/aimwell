<p>The oldest extant Pāli Chronicle of 
Ceylon. Like the Mahāvamsa, it was based on the Atthakathā handed down in the 
Mahāvihāra of Ceylon. It gives the impression not of an evenly worked out whole, 
but rather of a stringing together of fragments, a composition of whole lines, 
sometimes whole stanzas, borrowed from the Atthakathā. It is generally agreed 
that the Dīpavamsa assumed its present form about the fourth century A.C. It is 
stated (Cv.xxxviii.59) that Dhātusena made endowments for the regular recital of 
the Dīpavamsa.</p>
<p>The work was edited and published by 
Oldenberg in 1879. For details see Geiger: Dīpavamsa and Mahāvamsa.</p>
