<hr>
<p>1. Upatissa.-The personal name of 
Sāriputta (q.v.).</p>
<p>2. Upatissa.-Purohita to Vijaya, king of 
Ceylon. He founded a settlement at Upatissagāma. Mhv.vii.44; Dpv.ix.32, 36.</p>
<p>3. Upatissa I.-King of Ceylon. He 
reigned for forty-two years between A.C. 362 and 409. He was the eldest son of 
Buddhadāsa. He was of very kindly disposition and lived a simple life, eating of 
the food served in the Mahāpāli alms-hall. It is said that once, when the roof 
of his palace started leaking at night, he lay all night in the wet, being loth 
to disturb any of the servants. During a period of drought and famine, he 
organised a religious festival, causing rain to fall. He built the Rajuppala, 
Gijjhakūta, Pokkharapāsaya, Valāhassa, Ambutthi and Gondigāma tanks and the 
Khandarāja Vihāra, besides hospitals and almshouses for women in travail, the 
blind and the sick. He was murdered by his queen-consort, who had an intrigue 
with his younger brother, Mahānāma. For an account of Upatissa’s reign see 
Cv.i.37, 179ff.</p>
<p>4. Upatissa II.-King of Ceylon. He was 
the husband of the sister of Moggallāna I. and was his general. He killed Sīva 
I, and became king, his reign lasting only one year and a half (A.C. 522-24). He 
had a son Kassapa, called Girikassapa by virtue of his prowess, and a daughter 
who married Silākāla. Silākāla became a rebel and seized Upatissa’s kingdom. 
(For an account of Upatissa see Cv.xli.5f). Upatissa belonged to the Lambakanna 
clan, and in Sinhalese writing is called Lāmāni-upatissa (Cv.Trs.i.52, n.1).</p>
<p>5. Upatissa.-Son of Silākāla and brother 
of Dāthāpabhuti and Moggallāna II. He was a good-looking young man and was his 
father’s favourite. He was killed by Dāthāpabhuti (Cv.xli.33ff).</p>
<p>6. Upatissa Thera.-Called Pāsānadīpavāsī 
Upatissa. He appears to have written a Commentary on the Mahāvamsa, which the 
author of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā used for his own work, sometimes criticising its 
comments. See, e.g., MT.47.</p>
<p>7. Upatissa.-Thera of Tambapapidīpa 
(Ceylon), perhaps to be identified with No. 6 above. He and his colleague, 
Phussadeva, are often mentioned as being expert exponents of the Vinaya. 
Upatissa had two pupils, Mahāpaduma and Mahāsumma, who became very famous as 
vinayadharā. Mahāpaduma “read” through the Vinaya eighteen times with his 
teacher, and Mahāsumma nine times (Sp.i.263f). Buddhaghosa evidently regarded 
with great respect the explanations of various Vinaya questions as given by 
Upatissa, for he often quotes him. See, e.g., Sp.ii.456; iii.624, 714; iv.890.</p>
<p>8. Upatissa.-Sāriputta’s father and 
chieftain of Nālaka or Upatissagāma (q.v.). His proper name was Vanganta (q.v.), 
Upatissa being, evidently, his clan name (SnA.i.326).</p>
<p>9. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Pāli 
Mahābodhi-vamsa. He lived in Ceylon, probably in the tenth century. For details 
see P.L.C. 156ff.</p>
<p>10. Upatissa Thera.-He wrote a 
commentary on Kassapa’s Anāgatavamsa. Gv.p.72.</p>
<p>11. Upatissa.-A Pacceka Buddha, found in 
a nominal list (M.iii.69). The name is also found in the Apadāna (i.280; 
ii.454).</p>
<p>12. Upatissa Thera.-Sometimes called 
Arahā Upatissa, author of the Vimuttimagga (P.L.C. 86). He probably lived about 
the first century B.C. J.P.T.S. 1919, pp.69ff; see also NidA. (P.T.S.); introd. 
vi f.</p>
<p>13. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the 
Saddhammappajjotikā, the commentary on the Mahā Niddesa, written at the request 
of Deva Thera (NidA.ii.108). His residence was on the western side of the Mahā 
Cetiya within the precincts of the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura, and it was built 
by a minister, Kittissena.</p>
<p>Some MSS. give the author’s name as 
Upasena. For his age, see Saddhammappajjotikā.</p>
