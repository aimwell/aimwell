<p>A city. When <a href="apacara.htm" title="ay/apacara.htm">Apacara</a> (Upacara), king of 
Ceti, was swallowed up by the fires of <a href="aviici.htm" title="ay/aviici.htm">Avīci</a>, because of his falsehood, his five 
sons came to the brahmin Kapila and sought his protection. He advised them to 
build new cities. The city built by the fourth son was called Uttarapañcāla. It 
was founded in the north of Ceti, on the spot where the prince saw a wheel-frame 
(cakkapañjara) entirely made of jewels (J.iii.461).  </p>
<p>According to the scholiast 
to the <a href="kaamaniita_jat_228.htm" title="ka/kaamaniita_jat_228.htm">Kāmanīta Jātaka</a> (J.ii.214), however, and also according to the
<a href="kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm" title="ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm">Kumbhakāra 
Jātaka</a> (J.iii.379ff), Pañcāla or Uttarapañcāla is the name of a country (rattha) 
whose capital was Kampilla, while in the <a href="brahmadatta_jat_323.htm" title="b/brahmadatta_jat_323.htm">Brahmadatta Jātaka</a> (iii.79) also in the 
scholiast of the <a href="citta_sambhuuta_jat_498.htm" title="c/citta_sambhuuta_jat_498.htm">Citta-Sambhūta Jātaka</a> (iv.396), Uttarapañcāla is given as the 
name of the city and Kampilla as that of the country and we are told that a king 
Pañcāla reigned there.</p>
<p>Pañcāla was also the name of the king of 
Uttarapañcāla in the <a href="sattigumba_jat_503.htm" title="sa/sattigumba_jat_503.htm">Sattigumba Jātaka</a> (iv.430), the
<a href="jayaddisa_jat_513.htm" title="j/jayaddisa_jat_513.htm">Jayaddisa Jātaka</a> (v.21), 
and the <a href="gandatindu_jat_520.htm" title="g/gandatindu_jat_520.htm">Gandatindu Jātaka</a> (v.98). In all these Uttarapañcāla is spoken of as a 
city in Kampilla. In the <a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahā Ummagga Jātaka</a> (vi.391ff), Culani Brahmadatta is 
the king of Uttarapañcāla.</p>
<p>In the <a href="somanassa_jat_505.htm" title="s/somanassa_jat_505.htm">Somanassa Jātaka</a> (J.iv.444), 
mention is made of a city named Uttarapañcāla in the Kuru country, with Renu as 
its king. Whether the reference is to a different city it is not possible to 
say. See also <a href="pancala.htm" title="pa/pancala.htm">Pañcāla</a>.</p>
