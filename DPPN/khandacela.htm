<p>A monastery (probably in Ceylon), the 
residence of Padhāniya Thera. While the Elder was once listening to the 
Ariya-vamsa in the Kanikārapadhānaghara in the monastery, he was bitten by a 
snake, but bearing the pain in silence, concentrated his mind on the sermon. The 
poison sank to earth and he became an arahant. MA.i.65.</p>
