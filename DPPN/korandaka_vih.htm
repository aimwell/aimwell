<p>A monastery in Ceylon. The Visuddhi 
Magga (p.91) contains the story of a young monk, nephew of the Elder of the 
Vihāra, who went to Rohana for study; he later returned to the Vihāra, and for 
three months was waited on by his parents, but he did not reveal his identity, 
fearing that his parents would prove an impediment to him. </p>
<p>This monastery was once the residence of 
an Elder named Mahā Sangharakkhita. v.l. Corakandaka. MT.606.</p>
