  <h2>Akitti Jātaka (No. 480)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>See Akitti. It was related at Jetavana, 
of a generous donor who lived at Sāvatthi. This man invited the Buddha, and 
during seven days gave many gifts to him and to the monks. On the last day he 
presented the company of arahants with all necessaries. The Buddha praised the 
man’s generosity and told him how wise men of old shared their possessions with 
others, even when they themselves had nothing to eat but kāra-leaves and water.
