<p>The chief shrine at Ālavī (SnA.i.344; 
SA.i.207) (hence probably the name), originally a pagan place of worship, but 
later converted into a Buddhist vihāra. The Buddha stopped here on many 
occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, 
e.g. against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), 
using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the 
company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).
</p>
<p>The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a 
nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224). The Vangīsa Sutta was preached there to 
Vangīsa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa (Sn.59f). 
In the early years of Vangīsa’s novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his 
preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the 
second time because of his tutor’s solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, 
again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibhāna) (S.i.187). 
Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Alavaka, who visits him 
with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by 
observing the four characteristics of sympathy (sangahavatthūni) learnt from the 
Buddha (A.iv.216-20).</p>
<p>Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by 
day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the 
evenings (J.i.160). It was here that the Manikantha Jātaka was related 
(J.ii.282), also the Brahmadatta Jātaka (J.iii.78), and the Atthisena Jātaka 
(J.iii.351), all in connection with the rules for building cells. See also 
Ālavī.</p>
