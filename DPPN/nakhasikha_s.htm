<h4>1. Nakhasikhā Sutta</h4>
<p>Preached at Jetavana. Even as the mighty earth is many 
times greater than the pinch of dust taken on the tip of one’s finger-nail, so 
also is the Ill, destroyed by the Ariyan disciple of vision and understanding, 
greater than the Ill which remains undestroyed. S.ii.133; S.v.459.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nakhasikhā Sutta</h4>
<p>Simile the same as the above. Even so are the beings born 
elsewhere and not among humans greater by far than those born among humans. S.ii 
263.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nakhasikhā Sutta</h4>
<p>No material form, even as much as can be taken up on the 
tip of the finger-nail, is impermanent. It is the same with the other khandhas. 
Therefore is the holy life set forth for the utter destruction of suffering. 
S.iii.147.</p>
