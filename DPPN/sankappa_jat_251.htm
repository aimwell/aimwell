  <h2>Sankappa Jātaka (No. 251)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born into a very rich family of 
Benares. When his parents died he gave away his wealth, became an ascetic in the 
Himālaya, and developed iddhi powers. During the rains he returned to Benares, 
where, at the king’s invitation, he lived in the royal park. For twelve years he 
did this, till, one day, the king had to leave to quell a frontier rebellion, 
after having instructed the queen to look after the ascetic. One evening the 
ascetic returned rather late to the palace, and the queen, rising hastily at his 
arrival, let her garment slip. The ascetic’s mind became filled with thoughts of 
lust, and he lost his powers. On his return to the hermitage, he lay there for 
seven days without touching food. On his return, the king visited the ascetic, 
who explained that his heart had been wounded. Asking the king to retire from 
the hut, he once more developed his trance. He then took leave of the king and 
returned to Himavā.</p>
<p>The story was told to a monk who was filled with 
discontent because he had fallen in love with a woman whom he met on his alms 
rounds. The king is identified with Ānanda. J.ii.271-77.</p>
