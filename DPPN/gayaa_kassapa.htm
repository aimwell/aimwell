  <h2>Gayā-Kassapa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the three Kassapa brothers, the 
Tebhātika-Jatilā (q.v.). On leaving the world with his brothers and becoming an 
ascetic, he gathered round him a company of two hundred other ascetics. They all 
lived at Gayāsīsa, hence his name (Gayāsīse pabbajito ti Gayā Kassapo nāma jāto). 
When Uruvela-Kassapa was converted, Gayā-Kassapa, with his followers, joined the 
Order, and at the conclusion of the Adittapariyāya Sutta they all became 
arahants (Vin.i.33f.; AA.i.165). Gayā-Kassapa is reported (Thag.v.345f) to have 
said that he used to bathe three times a day at Gayātittha, in order to wash 
away his sins during the festival of Gayāphaggu.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
householder, and later became a forest-dwelling hermit. One day he saw the 
Buddha walking alone in the forest and offered him a kola-fruit (ThagA.i.417f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with 
Koladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.379; see also ii.483.</p>
