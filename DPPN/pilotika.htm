<h4>1. Pilotika</h4>
<p>A Paribbājaka. Jānussoni once met him returning from 
Jetavana, where he had gone early to wait on the Buddha. Pilotika, on being 
questioned, spoke very highly of the Buddha. It is this conversation which, on 
its being repeated by Jānussoni to the Buddha, led to the preaching of the 
Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (M.i.175 ff). Jānussoni addresses Pilotika as 
Vacchāyana, which, according to the Commentary, (MA.i.393) was the name of his 
clan. From the same source we gather that the Paribbājaka’s own name was 
Pilotikā; he was young, of a golden colour, and loved ministering to the Buddha 
and the Buddha’s eminent disciples. He is spoken of, together with Sabhiya 
(SA.ii.188), as a wise Paribbājaka. Pilotika is identified with Devinda of the 
Mahā Ummagga Jātaka. J.vi.478.</p>

<h4>2. Pilotika Thera</h4>
<p>Ānanda once saw a poor youth going along in a ragged 
garment, a potsherd in his hand. Ānanda took him to the monastery and ordained 
him. The youth hung his garment and the potsherd on the branch of a tree and 
practised meditation. After a time he became fat and discontented and wished to 
return to the lay life. But on noticing his rag and his potsherd, he realized 
his folly and, admonishing himself, returned to his meditation. Three times the 
same thing happened, but in the end he became an arahant. He used to speak of 
the rag as his “teacher.” DhA.iii.84f.</p>
