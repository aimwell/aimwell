<p>A younger brother of Dhammāsoka and a lay pupil of 
Giridatta Thera. One day he saw grey hairs on his head as he was being dressed 
and, seated as he was, he became a sotāpanna. Later he entered the Order and 
became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a brahmin, skilled 
in various branches of learning, and later became an ascetic. On his way to see 
the Buddha he died, and was reborn in the deva world. (ThagA.i.295f.; two verses 
attributed to him are given in Thag.169 70). He is probably identical with 
Buddhasaññaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.419f.; cf. Dvy.366f.</p>
