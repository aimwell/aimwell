<p>A king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>; so called because he 
never left a thing half done. One day on his way to the park he saw a forest 
fire which made him wish to burn all his defilements. Later, he saw men catching 
fish; one large fish broke through the net and escaped. Wishing to escape 
himself, he left the world and later became a Pacceka Buddha (SnA.i.114-15; 
ApA.i.159-60).</p>
<p>A stanza attributed to him is included 
in the Khagga-visƒÅna Sutta. Sn.v.62.</p>
