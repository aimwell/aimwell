</ul>
<p>A landowner of Mithilā, described also 
as Videha and Videhiputta, an inhabitant of the <a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a> country (J.v.166, 167). 
While journeying on business, in a carriage, attended by five hundred wagons, 
he saw the <a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāga</a> king,
<a href="sankhapala.htm" title="sa/sankhapala.htm">Sankhapāla</a>, being ill-treated by lewd men who had captured 
him and, feeling sorry for the Nāga, Alāra gave gifts to the men and their wives 
and thus obtained his release. Sankhapāla, thereupon, invited Alāra to the Nāga 
kingdom where, for a whole year, Alāra lived in all splendour.  </p>
<p>Later, realising 
that the Nāga’s wonderful possessions were the fruit of good deeds done in the 
past, he became an ascetic in Himavā and afterwards took up his abode in the 
king’s park in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. The king, seeing him on his begging-rounds, was pleased 
with his deportment and invited him to the palace. There, at the king’s request, 
he told him the story of his encounter with Sankhapāla and his subsequent life 
and exhorted the king to do acts of piety.</p>
<p>Later he was born in the Brahma-world. 
See the <a href="sankhapala_jat_521.htm" title="sa/sankhapala_jat_521.htm">Sankhapala Jātaka</a>. (v.161ff.).</p>
<p>Alāra was a previous birth of Sāriputta 
(Ibid., 177). (Ālāra.)</p>
