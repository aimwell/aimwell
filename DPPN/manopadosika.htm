  <h2>Manopadosikā (Manopadūsikā)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of devas living in the Cātummahārājika world 
(DA.i.114; AA.ii.544; MNid.108). They burn continually with envy one against 
another (Buddhaghosa relates a story illustrating this in DA.i.114) and their 
hearts become ill disposed and debauched. Their bodies thus become feeble and 
their minds imbecile, and, as a consequence, they fall from their state (D.i.20; 
iii.32).</p>
<p>The Manopadosikā were among those present at the preaching 
of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.260). They are so called because their minds are 
debauched by envy (dosassa anudahanatāya) (VibhA.498).</p>
