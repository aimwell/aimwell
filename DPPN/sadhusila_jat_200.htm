<p>The Bodhisatta was once a famous brahmin teacher. A 
certain brahmin had four daughters who were wooed by four suitors&nbsp;&nbsp; 
one handsome, another advanced in years, another of noble family, and the last 
virtuous. Unable to decide between them, the brahmin sought the teacher’s advice 
and gave all his four daughters to the virtuous man.</p>
<p>The story was related to a brahmin of Sāvatthi who 
consulted the Buddha in a similar case. The two brahmins were identical.
