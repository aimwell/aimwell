<p>The king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> once had a very talkative chaplain. 
Outside the city gate was a cripple, who lived under a banyan tree, so clever 
that he could cut the leaves of the tree into various shapes by throwing stones 
at them. The king, seeing him, engaged his services to cure his chaplain. The 
cripple obtained a peashooter filled with dry goat’s dung, and, sitting behind a 
curtain with a hole in it, he shot pellets of dung into the mouth of the 
chaplain as he talked away ceaselessly. When half a peck had thus been shot, 
the king revealed the plot to the chaplain and advised an emetic. The chaplain 
realized his folly and did not offend again. The cripple was given four 
villages, bringing in four thousand a year.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a novice on the banks 
of the Aciravatī who, challenged by his companions, shot a pebble through the 
eye of a swan in flight, the pebble emerging through the other eye.</p>
<p>The novice is identified with the cripple and Ānanda, with 
the king. The Bodhisatta was one of the king’s courtiers. See also Sunetta (3).
