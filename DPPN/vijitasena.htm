<p><b>3. Vijitasena Thera.</b> He was born in the family of 
an elephant trainer of Kosala, and had two maternal uncles, Sena and Upasena, 
who were also elephant trainers and had joined the Order. He saw the Buddha’s 
Yamakapātihāriya and entered the Order under his uncles, attaining arahantship 
in due course. In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a hermit and gave the 
Buddha some fruit (ThagA.i.424f). Several verses uttered by him in self 
admonition, in which he displays his knowledge of elephant craft, are included 
in the Theragāthā. Thag. vss. 355 9</p>

Apadāna. Ap.ii.398.</p>
