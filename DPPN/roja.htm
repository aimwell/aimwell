<p><b>1. Roja. </b>A Malla, inhabitant of Kusinārā. When the Buddha and Ānanda 
visited Kusinārā, the Malla chieftains decreed that whoever failed to pay homage 
to the Buddha would be fined five hundred coins. Roja was Ānanda’s friend, and 
Ānanda was pleased when he arrived to pay homage to the Buddha, but when Roja 
said that he did so only out of regard for his kinsmen’s decree, Ānanda was 
bitterly disappointed and asked the Buddha to discover some means by which Roja 
could be made to become his follower. The Buddha agreed to do this, and by means 
of the power of his compassion, Roja was induced to visit him again. The Buddha 
preached to Roja, who asked, as a boon, that the monks should accept hospitality 
only from him. This request was refused by the Buddha, who said that Roja must 
take his turn with others in showing hospitality to him and his monks. Finding 
that he had long to wait for his turn, Roja made enquiries, and, discovering 
that the monks had no supply of green vegetables (dāka) or pastry (pittakhādaniya), 
he consulted Ānanda, and, with the Buddha’s sanction, offered these things to 
the Buddha and his monks (Vin.i.247ff). It is said (J.ii.231f) that Roja once 
invited Ānanda to his house, and, after entertaining him lavishly, tried to 
induce him to leave the Order by offering him half his wealth. But Ānanda 
refused this offer, explaining to him the miseries involved in household life. 
Later, Ānanda repeated this conversation to the Buddha, who related the 
Vacchanakha Jātaka (q.v.) to show that Roja and Ānanda had been friends in a 
past life too.</p>
<p>Once Roja forced on Ānanda a linen cloth (khomapilotikā); Ānanda had need of 
it, and accepted it with the Buddha’s permission (Vin.i.296).</p>
