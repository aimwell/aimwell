  <h2>Kandagalaka Jātaka (No.210)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodihsatta was once a woodpecker 
named Khadiravaniya, and be had a friend named Kandagalaka. One day 
Khadiravaniya took Kandagalaka with him into the acacia wood (khadiravana) and 
gave him insects from the acacia trees. As Kandagalaka ate them, pride rose in 
his heart and, feeling he could get food without his friend’s assistance, he 
told him so. In spite of the warning of Khadiravaniya, Kandagalaka pecked at an 
acacia trunk, broke his beak, and fell down dead.</p>
<p>The story was related in connection with 
Devadatta’s attempts to imitate the Buddha, these attempts ending in his own 
ruin. Kandagalaka is identified with Devadatta. J.ii.162-4.</p>
