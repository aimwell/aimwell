<p><b>1. Sappurisa Sutta. </b>The unworthy man (asappurisa) 
always speaks what is discreditable to another, never what is discreditable to 
himself, and always sings his own praises. The worthy man is just the reverse. 
A.ii.77.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sappurisa Sutta. </b>The birth of a good man is like 
a good shower; it brings happiness to all. A.iii.46= ibid., iv. 244.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sappurisa Sutta. </b>The gifts of a good man are 
well chosen, proper, seasonable, given with care, repeatedly and with calm mind; 
after giving, he is glad. A.iv.243.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sappurisa Sutta.</b> The good man’s gifts are given 
in faith, with deference, seasonably, with unrestrained heart, and without hurt 
to himself or others. A.iii.172.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sappurisa Sutta.</b> The 113th sutta of the Majjhima 
Nikāya, preached at Jetavana. The good monk does not exalt himself or disparage 
others on grounds of family distinction, of eminent wealth, personal fame, gifts 
and instruction received, capacity for preaching, knowledge of the dhamma, 
observance of austere practices, etc.; the bad monk does. M.iii.37 45.</p>
