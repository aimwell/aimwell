<p>A Garuda-king seized a Nāga-king, and 
when the Nāga coiled himself round a banyan-tree the Garuda uprooted the banyan 
and took it with him. He ate the Nāga’s fat seated on a kotisimbali-tree, and 
threw away the banyan and the Nāga’s carcase. A bird who was in the banyan-tree 
left it and took up his abode in the simbali. The Bodhisatta, who was a 
tree-sprite in the simbali, trembled at the sight of the tiny bird, because the 
sprite knew that from the bird’s droppings huge trees would spring up and kill 
the simbali. The Garuda, seeing the sprite trembling, asked the reason, and on 
learning it frightened the bird away. It is right to distrust where distrust is 
proper.</p>
<p>The story was related to five hundred 
monks who were in danger of being overcome by sinful desires (J.iii.397ff). Cf. 
the Pālasa Jātaka.</p>
