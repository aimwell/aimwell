<p><b>1. Virūpakkha. </b>One of the Cātummahārājano (Regent 
Kings). He is Regent of the western quarter and lord of the Nāgas (D.ii.258; 
D.iii.199; Dvy. 126, 148). In the assembly of the devas he sits facing east 
(D.ii.207, 221). Kālakannī is his daughter (J.iii.257). All Nāgas visit him 
regularly as their lord and wait on him, and any question of dispute arising 
among them would be referred to him for solution. E.g., J.vi.168; cf. AA.i.143.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Virūpakkha.</b> The name of a Nāga family 
(Vin.ii.109; A.ii.72; J.ii.145); they were, perhaps, followers of Virūpakkha 
(q.v.).</p>
