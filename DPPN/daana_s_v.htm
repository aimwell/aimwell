<p><b>1. Dāna Sutta</b>.-Preached at Jetavana, 
regarding an offering founded by Velukantakī-Nandamātā to monks, with Sāriputta 
and Moggallāna at their head. Her offering, says the Buddha, is complete in six 
ways — three on the part of the giver and three on that of the recipients. The 
giver is glad at heart before making the gift, is satisfied while giving, and 
rejoices after the gift. The recipients are either free from lust, hatred and 
delusion, or are on the way to such freedom. The merit obtained from such a gift 
is infinite. A.iii.336f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dāna Sutta.</b>-Sāriputta, with the lay 
disciples of Campā, visits the Buddha at the Gaggarāpokkharani and asks him why 
the same offerings have, in one case, no reward, in another, great reward. The 
Buddha explains in detail. A.iv.59ff.</p>

<p><b>3. Dāna Sutta.</b>-On the eight kinds of 
alms. A.iv.236. (gr: A.VIII.31)</p>
