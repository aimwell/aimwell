  <h2>Bhagalavatī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A place in Uttarakuru where the Yakkhas assemble. 
</p>
<p>The Dīgha Nikāya (D.iii.201) speaks of it as a hall (sabhā), 
while the Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.197) says it is a mountain in Himavā 
where the devas assemble every month for eight days in order to settle disputes. 
The Yakkha leaders also attend these assemblies. </p>
<p>The Sumangalavilāsinī (DA.iii.967), however, says that it 
is a jewelled pavilion (ratanamandapa) twelve leagues in extent, on the banks of 
the Dharanī Lake. It is surrounded by a creeper named Bhagalavatī, hence, 
probably, its name.</p>
