  <h2>Vattagāmanī Abhaya</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>King of Ceylon (29 17 B.C.). He was the son of Saddhātissa, 
and came to the throne by killing the usurper Mahārattaka (v.l. Kammahārattaka).
</p>
<p>He married Anulā, wife of Khallātanāga, and adopted 
Mahācūlika as his own son; because of this Vattagāmanī came to be known as 
Pitirājā (this name occurs several times in the Commentaries — 
e.g., VibhA. passim, see Pitirājā). </p>
<p>Vattagāmanī had a second wife, Somadevī, and also a son of 
his own, called Coranāga. In the fifth month of his reign a brahmin, named 
Tissa, rose against him, but was defeated by seven Damilas who landed at 
Mahātittha. . After that, the Damilas waged war against the king and defeated 
him at Kolambālaka. It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattagāmainī, 
as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri 
(q.v.). The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala 
Mahātissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanasīva. In his flight he left 
Somadevī behind, and she was captured by the Damilas. </p>
<p>For fourteen years Vattagāmanī and his queen Anulā lived 
under the protection of Tanasīva, and, during this time, five Damilas ruled in 
succession at Anurādhapura; they were Pulahattha, Bāhiya, Panayamāra, Pilayamāra 
and Dāthika. </p>
<p>After a time, Anulā quarrelled with Tanasīva’s wife, and 
the king, in his resentment, killed Tanasīva. Later, when he also killed 
Kapisīsa, his ministers left him in disgust, but were persuaded by Mahātissa to 
return. When his preparations were complete, the king attacked Dāthika, slew 
him, and took the throne. He then founded Abhayagiri-vihāra and recovered 
Somadevī. He also built the Silāsobbhakandaka-cetiya. He had seven ministers who 
themselves built several vihāras; among them Uttiya, Mūla, Sāliya, Pabbata and 
Tissa are mentioned by name. </p>
<p>It was in the reign of Vattagāmanī that the Buddhist Canon 
and its Commentaries were first reduced to writing in Ceylon, according to 
tradition, in Aloka vihāra. For details of Vattagāmanī’s reign see Dpv.xx.14ff.; 
Mhv.xxxiii.34ff. The foundation of Abhayagiri vihāra formed the beginning of 
dissensions in the ranks of the monks (Cv.lxxiii.18). Vattagāmani was, however, 
regarded by later generations as a great protector of the faith (Cv.lxxxii.23). 
Various monasteries, chiefly rock temples, are traditionally ascribed to 
Vattagāmanī, and said to have been built by him during his exile; among these is 
the modern Dambulla vihāra. The Cūlavamsa calls him the founder of the 
Majjhavela vihāra. Cv.c.229.</p>
