<p>A <a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājikā</a>.  </p>
<p>She once saw <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> eating 
his meal, which he had begged from house to house, leaning against a wall. Sucimukhī asked him why he looked downwards while eating. When Sāriputta 
disclaimed doing so, she asked him, respectively, why he ate looking upwards, 
towards the four quarters, between the four quarters. He denied the truth of all 
her statements, and then explained to her his reason for his denial. He lived 
neither by such low arts as divination, nor by star gazing, going errands, or 
palmistry.  </p>
<p>Sucimukhī understood, and went about Rājagaha praising the 
blamelessness of Sākiyan monks. S.iii.238f.; SA.ii.253.</p>
