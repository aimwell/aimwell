<p><b>1. Lakkhī.
  </b>The Pāli equivalent of Laksmī, goddess of beauty and 
fortune. </p>
<p>The name is found usually only in later works. E.g., 
Cv.lxxii.101; lxxvi.233; J.ii.413; iii.306 (explained as being equal to paññā); 
v.113; the word Lacchī, however, probably equivalent to Lakkhī (1), is found in 
Thig.vs.419, but the passage is obscure. See Sisters 159, n.2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Lakkhī.
  </b>Daughter of Dhatarattha. She 
  is generally called Siri. For her story see the Sirikālakanni Jātaka.</p>
