<h4>1. Nerañjarā</h4>
<p>A river. After the Enlightenment, the Buddha lived under 
the Ajapāla Nigrodha (q.v.) at Uruvelā, on the banks of this river. There Māra 
tempted him, and, later, Brahmā persuaded him to preach the Dhamma.</p>
<p>Vin.i.1ff.; SN.vs.425ff.; cp. Mtu.ii.238; Lal.327 (261); 
S.i.103f; 122, 136ff.; v.167, 185, 232; Ud.i.1 4; ii.1; iii.10; A.ii.20f; 
D.ii.267.</p>
<p>The Commentaries say (E.g., J.i.68ff.; DhA.i.71; BuA.238) 
that when the Buddha, having realized the futility of austerities, left the 
Pañcavaggiyas, he retired to Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjarā, and there, 
just before the Enlightenment, Sujātā gave him a meal of milk rice, taking him 
to be a god. Before eating the food, he bathed in the ford called Suppatittha. 
Under the bed of the river lay the abode of the Nāga king, Kāla. There was a 
sāla grove on the banks, where the Buddha spent the afternoon previous to the 
night of the Enlightenment. </p>
<p>Three explanations are given of the name: (1) Its waters 
are pleasant (nelam jalam assā ti = nelañjalā, the r being substituted for the 
l); (2) it has blue water (nīla jalāyā ti vattabbe Nerañjarāyā ti vuttam); (3) 
it is just simply the name of the river. UdA.26f.</p>
<p>Nadī Kassapa’s hermitage was on the bank of the Nerañjarā 
(ThagA.i.45). </p>
<p>Nerañjarā is identified with the modern Nīlājanā, with its 
source in Hazaribagh, which, together with the Mohanā, unites to form the river 
Phalgu. CAGL 524.</p>

<h4>2. Nerañjarā</h4>
<p>A channel that branched northwards from the Punnavaddhana 
tank. Cv.lxxix.49.</p>
