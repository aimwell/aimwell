  <h2>Dakkhina-vihāra</h2>

</ul>
<p>A monastery built by Uttiya, a general 
of Vattagāmanī-Abhaya, to the south of Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxiii.88; Dpv.xix.19). 
It was originally inhabited by monks from the Abhayagiri-vihāra, but later there 
was a schism by the Dakkhinavihārakā, as the monks of the Dakkhina-vihāra were 
called (Mhv.xxxiii.98).</p>
<p>Ānanda gamanī-Abhaya built for the 
monastery the Mahāgāmenditank (Mhv.xxxv.5), while Kanitthatissaka added a 
mantling to the thūpa and built a refectory on some land on the boundary of the 
Mahāmeghavana; he also constructed a road to the vihāra, and moved on to one 
side the wall of the Mahāvihāra in order to do this (Mhv.xxxvi.12f). Vohāraka-Tissa 
erected a wall round the monastery (Mhv.vs.35) and Gothābhaya restored the 
uposatha hall (Mhv.vs.107). The thera Tissa, for whom Mahāsena built the 
Jetavana-vihāra, was an incumbent of Dakkhina-vihāra, in this context called 
Dakkhinārāma (Mhv.xxxvii.32). Aggabodhi I. erected a splendid pāsāda in the 
vihāra (Cv.xlii.14).</p>
<p>The vihāra is generally identified with 
what is now known as Elāra’s tomb (But see Cv.Trs.i.66, n.3).</p>
