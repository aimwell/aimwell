<p><b>1. Tapassu, Tapussa.</b>-A merchant of <a href="ukkalaa.htm" title="u/ukkalaa.htm">Ukkala</a>. He and his friend, 
<a href="bhallika.htm" title="b/bhallika.htm">Bhalluka</a> (Bhalliya), while on their way to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, 
saw the Buddha at the foot of the Rājāyatana tree, in the eighth week after the 
Enlightenment. Urged by a deity, who had been their relation, they offered the 
Buddha rice-cakes and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods. They 
became the first lay disciples of the Buddha, and their formula of Refuge 
contained no reference to the Sangha (Vin.i.3f; A.i.26; UdA.54; J.i.80).</p>
<p>According to the Theragāthā Commentary 
(i.48f), Tapassu and Bhalluka were brothers, sons of a caravan leader of 
Pokkharavatī. Some time later they visited the Buddha at Rājagaha, where he 
preached to them; Tapassu, thereupon, became a Sotāpanna, while Bhalluka entered 
the Order and became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha they were 
brahmins of Arunavatī. Hearing that two caravan leaders, Ujita and Ojita, had 
given the first meal to the Buddha, they gave alms to the Buddha and his monks, 
and wished for a similar privilege for themselves under a future Buddha. In the 
time of Kassapa Buddha, they were sons of Gopāla-setthi, and for many years 
provided the monks with milk rice.</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.207f) 
says that the deity, who caused Tapassu and Bhalluka to give alms to the Buddha, 
was their mother in their previous birth. The Buddha gave them, for worship, 
eight handfuls of his hair, which he obtained by stroking his head. They took 
the hair with them to their city — which, according to this account, was 
<a href="asitanjana.htm" title="ay/asitanjana.htm">Asitañjana</a> — and there built a cetiya, from which rays of blue light issued on 
fast-days. Tapassu is called a dvevācikaupāsaka (AA.ii.696), and is included in 
a list of eminent upāsakas. A.iii.450. The Sanskrit books call him Trapusa 
(Dvy.393; Mtu.iii.303.)</p>
