<p><b>1. Vesāli Sutta.</b> See Vajjiputta Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vesāli Sutta. </b>Ugga visits the Buddha at the 
Kūtāgārasālā and asks a question; the Buddha explains to him that it is grasping 
of objects, etc., which prevents some people from being quite free in this very 
life. S.iv.109.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vesāli Sutta.</b> The Buddha once addressed the 
monks on the great benefits of meditating on asubha, and then retired into 
solitude in the Mahāvana for a fortnight. The monks, filled with the idea of 
asubha, felt loathing for their bodies and many committed suicide. The Buddha 
hearing of this, summoned the monks to the Kūtāgārasālā and taught them the 
great merits of concentration on breathing. S.v.320f.</p>
