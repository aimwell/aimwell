<p>Thirty monks from Pāvā (described as 
Pāveyyakā), all forest-dwellers, visit the Buddha at Rājagaha. By means of 
various similes the Buddha tells them of the infiniteness of samsāra, and at the 
end of the sermon they become arahants (S.ii.187f ). </p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.32f) 
evidently refers to the same monks, but there it is stated that the Buddha first 
preached to them in the Kappāsikavanasanda while they were searching for a 
woman. We seem here to have a confusion of legends. cp. the Bhaddavaggiyas.</p>
