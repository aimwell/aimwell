<p>Pasenadi questions the Buddha as to how 
gifts should be given and the Buddha’s answer is that they should be bestowed 
where the heart is pleased to give. The further question is asked as to whom, 
when given, does a gift bear much fruit. To the virtuous, irrespective of class, 
says the Buddha, and he instances the case of a youth skilled in war as opposed 
to one who is untrained and unskilled, no matter what his social status. The 
Buddha proceeds to describe the qualities which are possessed by the virtuous 
man (S.i.98f).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.129f) describes 
this interview as a public one, taking place before a large audience, among whom 
are teachers of rival schools, “scratching the ground with their feet.” Their 
fame had suffered owing to the popularity of the Buddha and they had represented 
him as exhorting the people to give only to himself and to his followers. 
Pasenadi here gives the Buddha opportunity to vindicate himself.</p>
