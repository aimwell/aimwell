<p>The Vamsas and their country.  </p>
<p>It lay to the south of 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>, and its capital was Kosambī (E.g., J.iv.28) on the Yamunā. Udena, son of 
Parantapa, also called Vamsarājā (E.g., J.iv.370,390), was its king in the time 
of the Buddha.  </p>
<p><a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a> lay to the south of the Vamsa country. The Vamsā were also 
called Vatsā (Bud. India, 3, 27; Mtu.i.34). The country formed one of the 
sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadā</a>.</p>
<p>The district of Bhagga, in which was Sumsumāragiri, seems 
to have been subject to the Vamsā in the Buddha’s time, for we find Udena’s son, 
Bodhi, living there (J.iii.157, also Mahābhārata ii.30, 10f). In nominal lists 
(E.g., D.ii.200) the Vamsā, are generally mentioned with the Cetī.</p>
