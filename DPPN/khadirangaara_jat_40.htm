  <h2>Khadirangāra Jātaka (No.40)</h2>

<p>Once the Bodhisatta was Treasurer of 
Benares, and a Pacceka Buddha, rising from a seven days' samāpatti, came to him 
at meal time. The Bodhisatta sent him some food, but Māra created a pit of 
glowing khadira-embers between the Pacceka Buddha and the Treasurer’s house. 
When the Treasurer heard of this, he took the bowl of food himself and stepped 
into the pit, ready to die rather than to have his alms-giving thwarted. A lotus 
sprang up to receive his foot, the pit vanished, and Māra, discomfited, 
vanished.</p>
<p>The story was related to <a href="anaathapindika.htm" title="ay/anaathapindika.htm">Anāthapindika</a>.</p>
<p>A devatā, who lived in the upper storey 
of his palace, had to come with her children down to the ground floor whenever 
the Buddha visited Anāthapindika. She tried to check the merchant’s munificence 
by talking to his manager and his eldest son, but all in vain. At last, when as 
a result of his extreme piety Anāthapindika’s wealth was exhausted, the devatā 
ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take 
heed. He ordered her out of the house, and she had, perforce, to obey. In 
despair she sought the aid of Sakka, who suggested that she should recover for 
the merchant all his debts, and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been 
lost sight of. She did so, but Anāthapindika, before consenting to pardon her, 
took her to the Buddha, who then related this Jātaka. The 
<a href="velaama_sutta.htm" title="vy/velaama_sutta.htm">Velāmaka Sutta</a> was 
also preached on this occasion (J.i.226-34; see also the
<a href="visayha_jat_340.htm" title="vy/visayha_jat_340.htm">Visayha Jātaka</a>). For a 
continuation of the story see the <a href="siri_jat_284.htm" title="s/siri_jat_284.htm">Siri Jātaka</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary 
(DhA.i.447) the Khadirangāra Jākata was preached in reference to the two friends 
Sirigutta and Gharadinna. It is said (AA.i.57) that at the preaching of the 
Jātaka eighty-four thousand beings realised the Truth.</p>
