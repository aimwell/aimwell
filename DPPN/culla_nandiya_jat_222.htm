<p>v.l. CullĀnandaka</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a monkey named 
Nandiya and, with his brother Cullanandiya, headed a band of eighty thousand 
monkeys. They had a blind mother, and finding that when they were away with the 
herd she never received the fruits they sent her, they decided to stay with her 
in a banyan-tree near a village. One day a brahmin, who had studied at Takkasilā, 
entered the forest with a bow and arrow. He had been warned by his teacher 
Pārāsariya to curb his wickedness, but he could find no way, apart from killing, 
of keeping his wife and child. Seeing the aged monkey, he prepared to shoot her, 
but her sons offered their lives in her stead. The brahmin killed first them and 
then the mother. On his way home he heard that lightning had hit his house and 
that his family was dead; he himself was thereupon swallowed up by the fires of 
hell.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta’s wickedness. The hunter was Devadatta. J.ii.199-202.</p>
