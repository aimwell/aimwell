<p>1. Kanha.-A name for Māra (q.v.). E.g., 
Sn.v.355; M.i.377; D.ii.262; Thag.v.1189.</p>
<p>2. Kanha.-The name of the Bodhisatta; he 
was born in a brahmin family and later became a sage. He is also called

Buddha to smile. See Kanha Jātaka (2). DhsA.294, 426.</p>
<p>3. Kanha.-Another name of Vāsudeva

<p>4. Kanha.-Son of Disā, a slave girl of

(D.i.93). Later he went into the Dekkhan and, having learnt mystic verses, 
became a mighty seer. Coming back to Okkāka, Kanha demanded the hand of the 
king’s daughter Maddarūpī. At first the request was indignantly refused, but 
when Kanha displayed his supernatural powers he gained the princess. D.i.96f.;
