<hr>
<p><b>5. Sudhamma Thera.</b> He lived in Macchikāsanda, in a 
monastery (the Ambātakārāma) provided by Citta. Citta used to invite Sudhamma to 
his house for meals. One day Sāriputta, at the head of several eminent monks, 
visited Macchikāsanda and stayed in the monastery. Citta heard Sāriputta preach 
(and became a sakadāgāmin, says DhA), and, at the end of the sermon, invited him 
and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because 
he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day 
he visited Citta’s house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after 
seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes (tilasangulikā). 
Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a 
crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sāvatthi, reported the 
matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Sangha should 
pass the patisārānīyakamma on him. Sudhamma, thereupon, went to Macchikāsanda to 
ask pardon of Citta, but Citta would not forgive him. The Buddha then gave him a 
companion, and together they went to Citta, and Sudhamma again asked pardon for 
his fault. Citta pardoned him and asked to be pardoned himself (Vin.i.15-20; cf. 
DhA.ii.74ff). Later Sudhamma became an arahant. AA.i.210.</p>
