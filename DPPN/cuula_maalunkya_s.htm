  <h2>Cūla-Mālunkya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Elder Mālunkyaputta is dissatisfied, 
feeling that the Buddha has not expounded to him various speculations concerning 
life and death and the nature of the world. He visits the Buddha at Jetavana and 
tells him of his disappointment. The Buddha points out to him that no promise 
was made regarding the elucidation of such problems and tells him it were fitter 
if he were to speculate by striving for deliverance. Mālunkyaputta sees the 
error of his ways. M.i.426ff</p>
