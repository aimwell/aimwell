  <h2>Pūrana Kassapa</h2>

</ul>
<p>One of the six well known teachers, contemporaneous with 
the Buddha. He is said to have taught the doctrine of non-action (akiriya), 
denying the result of good or bad actions (D.i.52 f); probably the more correct 
description of Kassapa’s teaching would be niskriyavāda — 
i.e., an affirmation that the soul is passive, unaffected by the good or the bad 
done by us, the ultimate reality lying beyond good or evil.</p>
<p>Elsewhere (S.iii.69; v.126), however, he is mentioned as 
an ahetuvādin, denying hetupaccaya (condition and cause — 
i.e., the efficacy of kamma), which teaching, in the Sāmmaññaphala Sutta 
(D.i.53; see also A.iii.383, where the teaching of Chalabhijātiyo is also 
attributed to Pūrana), is attributed to Makkhali Gosāla. </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.142; he could not have been a 
slave. Kassapa is a brahmin gotta. The SNA (372) calls him an ājīvaka) that 
Pūrana Kassapa came by his name from the fact that as a result of his birth the 
number of slaves in a certain household reached one hundred. Owing to this fact 
he was never found fault with, even when he failed to do his work 
satisfactorily. But, in spite of this, he was dissatisfied and fled from his 
masters. He then had his clothes stolen by thieves and went about naked. His 
gotta name was Kassapa. He had a following of five hundred, among whom was the 
deva putta Asama (S.i.65, see also Ajātasattu). He was consulted by the 
Licchavis Abhaya (S.v.126) and Mahāli (S.iii.68) and by the wanderer Vacchagotta 
(S.iv.398). He claimed to be omniscient. (A.iv.428; here we probably have a more 
correct explanation of his name, Pūrana&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e., in his claim to have 
attained perfect wisdom, pūranañānna). </p>
<p>A story in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.208)* states 
that when the heretics were unable to prevent the Buddha from performing the 
Twin Miracle under the Gandamba, they fled discomfited. Pūrana Kassapa was among 
them, and in the course of his flight, he came across one of his followers, a 
farmer, who was on his way to see him, carrying a vessel of broth and a rope. 
Pūrana took the vessel and the rope, and going to the banks of the river near 
Sāvatthi, tied the vessel round his neck and threw himself into the stream. 
There was a circle of bubbles on the water and Pūrana was reborn in Avīci. The 
Milindapañha (p. 4 f) also mentions a Pūrana Kassapa, contemporary with Milinda. 
This perhaps refers to a teacher descended from the same school who is credited 
with the view that the earth rules or sustains the world. v.l. Purāna.</p>
<p>* For a different version see Rockhill: op. cit., 80. 
According to this legend, Kassapa must have died in the sixteenth year of the 
Buddha’s ministry. This is hardly reconcilable with the statement that 
Ajātasattu consulted him.</p>
