<p>A series of questions asked by <a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahā Kotthita</a> on 
psychological topics <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
e.g., understanding, consciousness, feeling, perception, pure mental 
consciousness (manoviññāna), isolated from the five faculties of bodily sense&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
the eye of understanding, right outlook, types of rebirth, first <i>jhāna</i>, etc.
<span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; and 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta’s</a> 
answers thereto (M.i.292 8). </p>
