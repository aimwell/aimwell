  <h2>Bandhula</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Son of a chieftain of the <b>Mallas</b> in <b>Kusinārā</b>. 
He studied at <b>Takkasilā</b> with <b>Mahāli</b> and <b>Pasenadi</b>. On his 
return home, he wished to give an exhibition of his skill, and the princely 
families of the Mallas bound sticks of bamboo in bundles of sixty, inserting a 
strip of iron in each bundle; they then suspended the bundles in the air and 
challenged Bandhula to cut them down. He leapt up in the air and smote them with 
his sword, but on discovering the treachery of his kinsmen, he threatened to 
kill them all; his parents, however, dissuaded him, and he went to live in 
Sāvatthi, where Pasenadi appointed him Senāpati. </p>
<p>Bandhula’s wife was <b>Mallikā</b> (known as <b>Bandhula</b><b>-</b><b>Mallikā</b> 
in order to distinguish her from the wife of Pasenadi). As she bore no children, 
Bandhula wished to send her back to her people; but when she went to bid 
farewell to the Buddha before her departure, he asked her to return to her 
husband. He accepted her, thereby showing his faith in the Buddha. Soon after 
she conceived a child, and her pregnancy longing was to enter the lotus tank 
used by the princes of <b>Vesāli</b> on their coronation and to drink its water. 
Bandhula took her to Vesāli, drove away the strong guards who were posted at the 
lotus tank, and let Mallikā enjoy it to her heart’s content. When the <b>
Licchavi</b> princes heard of this, they were greatly enraged and pursued 
Bandhula’s chariot, in spite of the warning of Mahāli. When the chariots of the 
Licchavis came into line, Bandhula, in order to frighten them, twanged his bow; 
but as they still pursued him, he shot a single arrow, which pierced each of the 
five hundred Licchavis through his girdle without their being aware of the 
wound. Bandhula told them of their plight; but they refused to believe him until 
they loosed the girdle of the foremost and he fell down dead. Thereupon they 
returned to their homes, bade farewell to their families, and fell dead on the 
moment of loosening their armour.</p>
<p>Mallikā bore twin sons sixteen times; each of them became 
perfect in the various arts, and each had a retinue of one thousand men. One 
day, Bandhula retried a case, which had been unjustly decided by the judge and 
his decision was greatly applauded. The king, hearing the applause and learning 
the reason, appointed him judge. It is probably this incident, which is referred 
to at S.i.74 (<b>Atthakarana Sutta</b>); see also KS.i.101, n.3. </p>
<p>But the former judges poisoned the king’s mind against 
Bandhula, and the king, listening to them, sent Bandhula and his sons to quell a 
frontier rebellion, giving orders that they should all be murdered on the way 
home. This was done, and the news of the massacre was brought to Mallikā while 
she was entertaining five hundred monks led by the two Chief Disciples 
(according to MA.ii.753 the Buddha was also present). Mallikā read the message, 
and placing it in a fold of her dress, went on with her duties. <b>Sāriputta</b> 
discovered her fortitude at the end of the meal and greatly praised her. Mallikā 
sending for her daughters in law, broke the news to them, urging them to harbour 
no resentment against the king. The king’s spies, discovering this, brought the 
news to Pasenadi. The king was greatly moved, and having sent for Mallikā, 
begged her forgiveness and granted her a boon. She chose as her boon that she 
and her thirty two daughters in law should be allowed to return home to <b>
Kusinārā</b>. Bandhula’s nephew, <b>Dīghakārāyāna</b>, was appointed 
commander-in chief, but he never forgave the injury to Bandhula, and, in the 
end, brought about Pasenadi’s deposition and consequent death (DhA.i.228f., 349 
56; J.iv.148 ff.; MA.ii.753f).</p>
<p>Bandhula isi sometimes referred to as <b>Bandhulamalla</b>. 
(E.g., J.iv.148.) </p>
<p>Bandhula’s wife, Mallikā, was one of the three persons 
possessing the <b>Mahālatāpasādhana</b>, the others being <b>Visākhā</b> and <b>
Devadāniyacora</b> (but see DhA.i.412, where the daughter of Bārānasīsetthi is 
substituted for Devadāniya).</p>
<p>From the time of her husband’s death Mallikā laid aside 
the pasādhana, but, on the day on which the Buddha’s body was being removed for 
cremation, she washed the pasādhana in perfumed water and placed it on the body, 
which it completely covered. She expressed the wish that, as long as she 
remained in samsāra, her body should need no ornament. DA.ii.597.</p>
