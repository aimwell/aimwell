<p><b>1. Channa</b>.-A Wanderer, classed 
among those who wore clothes (paticchannaparibbājaka). He is only mentioned 
once, in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.215), where we are told that he visited 
Ānanda at Sāvatthi and asked him questions about the Buddha’s teaching (see 
Channa Sutta below). Both the Sutta and the Commentary (AA.i.432) add that he 
was pleased with Ānanda’s explanation, and admitted that the Buddha’s teachings 
were worthy of being followed, though it is not explicitly stated that he 
accepted them.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Channa.</b>-A Thera. No 
particulars of his early life are available. He once stayed at Gijjhakūta, 
dangerously ill and suffering much pain. He was visited by Sāriputta and Mahā 
Cunda, and when they discovered that he contemplated suicide, they tried to 
deter him, promising to provide him with all necessaries and to wait on him 
themselves. Finding him quite determined, Sāriputta discussed with him the 
Buddha’s teachings and then left him. Soon afterwards Channa committed suicide 
by cutting his throat. When this was reported to the Buddha, he explained that 
no blame was attached to Channa, for he was an arahant at the moment of death 
(M.iii.263ff; S.iv.55ff).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.1012f.; 
SA.iii.12f ) that after cutting his throat, Channa, feeling the fear of death, 
suddenly realised that he was yet a puthujjana. This thought so filled him with 
anguish that he put forth special effort, and by developing insight became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>Channa had friends and relations in the 
Vajjian village of Pubbavijjhana (v.l. Pubbavajira), and came himself from 
there. v.l. Chandaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Channa.</b>-Gotama’s charioteer 
and companion, born on the same day as Gotama (J.i.54; Mtu.ii.156, 164, 189, 
233; iii.91, 262; BuA.233; SA.ii.231; DhsA.34. ThagA. (i.155) says he was the 
son of a servant woman of Suddhodana). When Gotama left household life, Channa 
rode with him on the horse Kanthaka as far as the river Anomā. There Gotama gave 
him his ornaments and bade him take Kanthaka back to his father’s palace (A 
thūpa was later erected on the spot where Channa turned back; Dvy.391). When, 
however, Kanthaka died of a broken heart, Channa’s grief was great, for he had 
suffered a double loss. It is said that he begged for leave to join Gotama as a 
recluse, but this leave was refused (J.i.64f). He therefore returned to 
Kapilavatthu, but when the Buddha visited his Sākiyan kinsfolk, Channa joined 
the Order. Because of his great affection for the Buddha, however, egotistical 
pride in “our Buddha, our Doctrine” arose in him and he could not conquer this 
fondness nor fulfil his duties as a bhikkhu. (ThagA.i.155; his verse (No.69) 
quoted in Thag. does not, however, refer to any such remissness on his part).</p>
<p>Once, when in the Ghositārāma in 
Kosambī, Channa committed a fault but was not willing to acknowledge it. When 
the matter was reported to the Buddha, he decreed that the ukkhepaniya-kamma be 
carried out against him, forbidding him to eat or dwell with the Sangha. He 
therefore changed his residence, but was everywhere “boycotted,” and returned to 
Kosambī subdued and asking for reprieve, which was granted to him. Vin.ii.23ff. 
His obstinacy and perverseness are again mentioned elsewhere — e.g., Vin.iv.35, 
113, 141. A patron of his once erected a vihāra for him, but he so thatched and 
decked it that it fell down. In trying to repair it he damaged a brahmin’s 
barley field (Vin.iii.47). See also Vin.iii.155f., 177.</p>
<p>Later, in a dispute between the monks 
and the nuns, he deliberately sided with the latter; this was considered so 
perverse and so lacking in proper esprit de corps, that the Buddha decreed on 
him the carrying out of the Brahmadanda whereby all monks were forbidden to have 
anything whatsoever to do with him. This was the last disciplinary act of the 
Buddha, and the carrying out thereof was entrusted to Ānanda. D.ii.154. It 
would, however, appear from DhA.ii.110 that the Brahmadanda was inflicted on 
Channa for his having repeatedly reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna in spite of 
the Buddha’s warning. In this version other details also vary.</p>
<p>When Ānanda visited Channa at the 
Ghositārāma and pronounced on him the penalty, even his proud and independent 
spirit was tamed; he became humble, his eyes were opened, and dwelling apart, 
earnest and zealous, he became one of the arahants, upon which the penalty 
automatically lapsed (Vin.ii.292). In the past, Channa met Siddhattha Buddha 
going towards a tree, and being pleased with him, spread for him a soft carpet 
of leaves round which he spread flowers. Five kappas ago he became king seven 
times, under the name of Tinasanthāraka (ThagA.i.155).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Senāsanadāyaka of the Apadāna (i.137).</p>
<p>Channa is identified with the hunter in 
the Suvannamiga (III.187), the Gijjha (III.332), the Rohantamiga (IV.423), the 
Cūlahamsa (V.354), and the Mahāhamsa (V.382) Jātakas, with the wrestler in the 
Sālikedāra Jātaka (IV.282) and with Cetaputta in the Vessantara Jātaka (VI.593).
