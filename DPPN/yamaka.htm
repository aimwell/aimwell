<p><b>1. Yamaka.</b> The sixth book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. 
It is divided into ten chapters (called Yamaka)&nbsp;&nbsp; Mūla, Khandha, 
Āyatana, Dhātu, Sacca, Sankhārā, Anusaya, Citta, Dhamma and Indriya. The method 
of treatment of each of the ten divisions tends to be threefold. Firstly, a 
Paññattivāra or section deliminating the term and concept, divided into an 
Uddesavāra, stating the inquiries only, and a Niddesavāra, wherein the inquiries 
are repeated with their several answers. Secondly, and mainly, there is the 
Pavattivāra, referring not to procedure generally, but to living processes, and, 
lastly, the Pariññāvāra, dealing with the extent to which a given individual 
(i.e., a class of beings) understands the category under consideration. There is 
a Commentary to the Yamaka by Buddhaghosa, which is included in the 
Pañcappakaranatthakathā.</p>
<p>See P.T.S. edn., i.xix ff.; the Yamaka has been published 
by the P.T.S. 1911, 1913.</p>

by Sāriputta. See Yamaka Sutta.</p>

<p><b>3. Yamaka. </b>A man belonging to the retinue of King 
Eleyya. He was a follower of Uddaka Rāmaputta. A.ii.180; AA.ii.554.</p>
