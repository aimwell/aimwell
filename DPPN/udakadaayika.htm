<p>An arahant. In a previous birth she was 
a water-carrier and maintained her children on her wages. Having nothing else to 
give, she regularly provided water in a bath for others. As a result, she was 
born in heaven and was fifty times queen of the deva-king and twenty times queen 
of kings on earth. She could produce rain at will, and her body knew neither 
heat nor dirt. Ap.ii.521-2.</p>
