  <h2>Silāyupa Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sāriputta tells the monks that when a monk is wholly 
freed, objects, sounds, scents, etc., that come within the range of his senses, 
cannot overwhelm his mind. It is like a stone column ten cubits long, one half 
of it buried in the ground, which cannot be shaken by the wind.</p>
<p>The sutta was preached as the result of a conversation 
between Sāriputta and Candikāputta regarding the teachings of Devadatta. 
A.iv.402f.</p>
