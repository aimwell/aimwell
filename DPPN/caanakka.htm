<p>A brahmin of Takkasilā, who killed King 
DhanĀnanda and placed Candagutta on the throne (Mhv.v.16f.; Mbv.98). In his 
youth Cānakka looked after his mother, and finding that she was worrying lest 
he, who was destined for kingly power, should leave her, he broke his tooth, 
having been told that there his luck resided. One day, on going for alms to 
DhanĀnanda’s palace, he was insulted, and in order to avenge the insult he 
kidnapped the king’s son, Pabbatakumāra. He then adopted Candagutta and, finding 
him better fitted for kingship than Pabbata, he contrived that the latter should 
be killed. When preparations had been made, he induced Candagutta to rise in 
revolt against DhanĀnanda, and, finally, to kill him and ascend the throne. (See 
MT.181ff for details, also Candagutta).</p>
<p>The Theragāthā Commentary (i.440) states 
that Tekicchāni’s father, Subandhu, roused the jealousy of Cānakka, who had him 
put in prison.</p>
