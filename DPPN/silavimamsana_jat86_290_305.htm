<p><b>1. Sīlavīmamsana Jātaka (No. 86).</b> The Bodhisatta 
was chaplain to the king of Benares and wished to test the respective powers of 
virtue and learning (as given above in the <a href="silavimamsa_jat_330_362.htm" title="s/silavimamsa_jat_330_362.htm">Sīlavīmamsa Jātaka 1</a>). When being led 
before the king, he saw snake charmers exhibiting their snake and warned them 
lest it should bite them. “He is not like you,” they replied, “for he is good.” 
The king ordered the chaplain to be executed; but, on hearing of his intentions, 
he allowed him to become an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a learned and pious 
brahmin, in the service of the king of Kosala, who carried out a similar test. 
Then he joined the Order and became an arahant. J.i.369-71.</p>

<p><b>2. Sīlavīmamsana Jātaka (No. 290).</b> Very similar to 
No. 1 above.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sīlavīmamsana Jātaka (No. 305).</b> The Bodhisatta 
was once a brahmin, head of five hundred students under one teacher. The 
teacher, wishing to test them, told them that he wished to give his daughter in 
marriage, and asked them to steal things for her ornaments and clothes without 
letting anyone know. They all did this except the Bodhisatta, who brought 
nothing. When asked the reason of this behaviour, he said: “You accept nothing 
unless brought in secrecy; but in wrong doing there is no secrecy.” The teacher 
then explained his intention, and, very pleased with the Bodhisatta, gave him 
his daughter in marriage. The names of six pupils who stole were: Dujjacca, 
Ajacca, Nanda, Sukha Vacchana, Vajjha and Addhuvasīla.</p>
<p>The story was related, late at night, to a company of 
monks who went about discussing the pleasures of the senses. The Buddha asked 
Ānanda to collect them and preached to them. At the end of the sermon they 
became sotāpannas. Sāriputta is identified with the teacher. J.iii.18-20.</p>
