<p>A monastery in Rohana, founded by 
Kākavanna-Tissa (Mhv.xxii.23). It was also called Tissārāma (Mhv.xxii.28). It 
was one of the chief monastic establishments in Ceylon and was a place of 
pilgrimage. Some of the Sinhalese chronicles mention that Kākavanna-Tissa built 
another vihāra of the same name on the east coast of Ceylon, at the place now 
known as Seruvila, where the Buddha’s frontal bone is deposited. The 
Mahāmeghavanārāma is also sometimes called the Tissamahārāma (E.g., Mhv.xx.25), 
and Tissārāma (Mhv.xv.174, 179, 203). Dappula gave to the Tissamahā-vihāra the 
village of Kattikapabbata (Cv.xiv.59).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.581) that in his 
time all monks living in Ceylon, south of the Mahāvālukanadī, assembled there 
twice a year, on the first and last day of the vassa.</p>
