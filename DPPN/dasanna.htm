<p>A country in Central India. Rujā was 
once born as an ox there (J.vi.238). It was apparently a centre of the art of 
sword-making&nbsp; (J.iii.338). Erakaccha, a city in Dasanna, was the residence of 
the setthi Dhanapāla (Pv.ii.7). The kings of Dasanna are called Dasannā. Dasanna 
is mentioned in the Mahāvastu (i.34) as one of the sixteen mahājanapadas, and 
also in the Mahābhārata (ii.5-10) and the Meghadūta (24-5). It is generally 
identified with Vidisā or the Bhilsa region in the Central Provinces.</p>
