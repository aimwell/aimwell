<p>Once, Vepacitti, ruler of the Asuras, was ill. 
 
</p>
<p>He was visited by Sakka, who was requested by the Asuras to heal him.  </p>
<p>Sakka 
agreed to do this if Vepacitti would teach him the Sambaramāyā. But Vepacitti 
wished to consult the Asuras on this matter and was advised against it. S.i.238.</p>
