<p>The eldest of the five daughters of the third Okkāka, her 
mother being Hatthā. She developed a skin disease, and her brothers, not wishing 
to be near her, took her into the forest and left her near a pond. There she met 
Rāma, king of Benares, who, afflicted with a similar disease, was living in 
exile in the forest. After hearing Piyā’s story, he married her, and they had 
thirty two children, who became the ancestors of the Koliyans. SNA.i.352f.,
