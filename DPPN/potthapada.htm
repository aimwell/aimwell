<h4>1. Potthapāda</h4>
<p>A Paribbājaka. A discussion between him and the Buddha on 
trance and on the soul, which took place in Mallikārāma in Sāvatthi, is reported 
in the Potthapāda Sutta. Potthapāda, accepting the Buddha’s views, was jeered at 
by his companions for doing so. Two or three days later he again visited the 
Buddha with Citta Hatthisāriputta (q.v.), when the Buddha continued the earlier 
discussion on personality and the soul. At the end of the discourse Potthapāda 
became the Buddha’s follower (D.i.178ff). Potthapāda is identified with Pukkusa 
of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka. J.vi.478.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Potthapāda</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a parrot. For his story see the 
Rādha Jātaka (1). J.i.495f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Potthapāda</h4>
<p>A parrot, younger brother of Rādha, the Bodhisatta. 
Potthapāda is identified with Ānanda. For his story see the Rādha Jātaka (2). 
J.ii.132 ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Potthapāda</h4>
<p>A parrot born as the younger brother of the Bodhisatta and 
identified with Ānanda. For their story see Kālabāhu Jātaka. J.iii.97 ff.; see 
also J.iv.129.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Potthapāda Thera</h4>
<p>In the past he was born as Sunetta, son of King Kitava, 
and because he insulted a Pacceka Buddha he was reborn in Avīci. Later he was 
born in a family of fishermen near Kundinagara, but, remembering his past lives, 
he refused to take part in any fishing. His parents therefore cast him out, but 
Ānanda, finding him starving, gave him food, and, at the Buddha’s suggestion, 
ordained him. He soon became an arahant and dwelt with twelve others in 
Sānavāsipabbata. Potthapāda’s kinsmen became petas, and his parents sent to him 
a brother, of whom Potthapāda was specially fond, to plead for his intervention. 
He therefore begged alms, and offered them to his colleagues in the name of his 
kinsmen, who thus regained happiness. Pv.iii.2; PvA.177 ff.</p>
