  <h2>Kākavanna-Tissa (Kākavanna)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A king of the Rohana dynasty in Ceylon. 
He was the great-grandson of Mahānāga, brother of Devānampiya-Tissa, and his 
father was Gothābhaya (Mhv.xv.170f; Mbv.132). His capital was at Mahāgāma. He 
had as wife, Devī (better known as Vihāradevī), daughter of Tissa, king of 
Kalyāni, who had been cast into the sea to expiate her father’s crimes 
(Mhv.xxii.20ff). Their children were Dutthagāmani Abhaya and Saddhā-Tissa. 
Kākavanna-Tissa gathered round him all the foremost Sinhalese warriors of the 
time so that they should be available for Gāmani, when the time came for his 
campaign against the Damilas (Mhv.xxiii.2).</p>
<p>But at the start Kākavanna-Tissa was 
very reluctant to allow his son to make preparations for such a campaign 
(Mhv.xxii.82f), so much so that, in exasperation, the young prince once sent his 
father some female ornaments to indicate that the king was no man (Mhv.xxiv.4). 
Kākavanna-Tissa was very pious, and is said to have built sixty-four vihāras, 
sixty-four years being also the length of his reign (Mhv.xxiv.12; see also 
AA.i.279). Among the religious edifices built by him were the Tissamahārāma, the 
Cittalapabbatavihāra (Mhv.xxii.23) and the Mahānuggala Cetiya. He was cremated 
at Tissamahārāma (xxiv.8, 13). He evidently received his name on account of his 
dark colour. The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xviii.20; were their names Mahilā and Samantā?; 
see also xix.21f) speaks of Kākavanna-Tissa’s daughters as having been 
proficient in the history of the, Religion (saddhammavamsakovidā).</p>
<p>He was once a milakkka in India and 
looked after a Pacceka Buddha. One day he gave the Pacceka Buddha a meal of ripe 
jack-fruit. On another occasion, when the Pacceka Buddha visited his house in 
his absence, his wife tried to tempt him. Having failed, she complained to the 
husband that the Pacceka Buddha had assaulted her. The latter sought the Pacceka 
Buddha to kill him, but, seeing him in mid air putting on his robe, he was 
filled with wonder and asked the Pacceka Buddha’s forgiveness. Later he was born 
in a hunters' village near Amaruppala-lena, his name being Amaruppala, and did 
various good deeds.</p>
<p>He was called Kākavanna-Tissa because he 
knew the speech of crows. Ras.ii.53f; see also p.64, where a crow announces 
various things to him.</p>
