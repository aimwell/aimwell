<p>A village in South Ceylon, on the 
Manigangā (Mānik-ganga), about ten miles to the north of Tissamahārāma, on the 
old road from Mahāgāma to Guttasāla. It was evidently an important centre even 
in the time of Devānampiya-Tissa, because we find that the nobles of Kājaragāma 
are mentioned among those taking part in the festival of the Bodhi-Tree when it 
was brought over by Sanghamittā (Mhv.xix.54). In the village was planted one of 
the eight saplings produced from the Bodhi-Tree (Mhv.xix.62; Mbv.161f; 
Sp.i.100). A vihāra was erected in Kācaragāma by Aggabodhi, ruler of Rohana 
(Cv.xlv.45), among the occupants of which is mentioned Milakkha-Tissa Thera 
(AA.i.22). The place was of strategic importance, and was sometimes used as the 
seat of the government in Rohana. E.g., by Loka (Cv.lvii.2), by Kassapa, the 
Kesadhātu (Cv.lvii.66ff); see also Cv.lviii.6. </p>
<p>The village is now chiefly famous for 
the celebrated shrine of Skanda.</p>
