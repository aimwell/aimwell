  <h2>Kusinārā</h2>

<p>The capital of the <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallas</a> and the scene 
of the Buddha’s death. At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with 
wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> was, at first, 
disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his 
Parinibbāna. But the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, by preaching the 
<a href="mahasudassana_s.htm" title="maha/mahasudassana_s.htm">Mahā-Sudassana Sutta</a>, pointed out to him that in 
ancient times it had been <a href="kusaavaatii.htm" title="ku/kusaavaatii.htm">Kusāvatī</a>, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana (D.ii.146). 
Between Kusinārā and <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>, three gāvutas away (DA.ii.573) — from where the 
Buddha came to Kusinārā on his last journey from <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, stopping at various 
places — lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; 
beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river, and near the city, in a south-westerly 
direction, lay the Upavattana, the Sāla-grove of the Mallas, which the Buddha 
made his last resting-place (UdA.238; DA.ii.572f).</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death his body was 
carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern 
gate; to the east of the city was Makutabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and 
there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held 
a festival in honour of the relics (D.ii.160f).</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha had three 
reasons for coming to Kusinārā to die:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) Because it was the proper venue for 
the preaching of the Mahā-Sudassana Sutta; </li>
  <li>(2) because Subhadda would visit him 
there and, after listening to his sermon, would develop meditation and become an 
arahant while the Buddha was still alive; and </li>
  <li>(3) because the brahman Doha would 
be there, after the Buddha’s death, to solve the problem of the distribution of 
his relics (UdA.402f; DA.ii.573f6). </li>
</ul>
<p>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became 
one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of 
pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>, Buddhagayā and 
<a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a> (D.ii.140). Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the 
Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from 
Āpana and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of 
Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them 
were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any 
inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to 
the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Roja the 
Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green 
vegetables and pastries (Vin.i.247f). During some of 
these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he 
preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (A.i.274f; v.79f) 
and the “Kinti” Sutta (M.ii.238f). A third Kusinārā 
Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. (A.ii.79; for another discourse 
to some noisy monks at Upavattana, see Ud.iv.2).</p>
<p>Kusinārā was the birthplace of Bandhula 
and his wife Mallikā (DhA.i.338, 349). It was twenty-five yojanas from Rājagaha 
(DA.ii.609; acc. to Fa Hsien, p.40, it was twenty-four yojanas from 
Kapilavatthu) and lay on the high road from Alaka to Rājagaha, the road taken by 
Bāvarī’s disciples (SN.v.1012).</p>
<p>This was evidently the road taken also 
by Mahā Kassapa from Pāvā, when he came to pay his last respects to the Buddha 
(Vin.ii.284).</p>
<p>According to a late tradition, 
one-eighth of the Buddha’s relics were deposited in a cairn in Kusinārā and 
honoured by the Mallas (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.3).</p>
<p>In ancient times Kusinārā was the 
capital of King Tālissara and twelve of his descendants (Dpv.iii.32). It was 
also the scene of the death of Phussa Buddha at the Setārāma (v.l. Sonārāma) 
(BuA.195; Bu.xix.25).</p>
<p>In <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang’s</a> day there still 
existed towers and Sarighārāmas erected to mark the spots connected with the 
Buddha’s last days and obsequies at Kusinārā. According to his account (Beal. 
op. cit.li. lii. n) Kusinārā was nineteen yojanas from Vesāli.</p>
<p>To the northern Buddhists the place was 
also known as Kusigrāma (Kusigrāmaka) and Kusinagarī (E.g., Dvy.152f, 208).</p>
<p>Kusinārā is identified with the village 
of Kasia at the junction of the river Rapti and the smaller Gondak and in the 
cast of the Gorakhpur district (CAGI.i.493). A copper plate belonging to the 
thūpa erected at the site of the Buddha’s death has recently been discovered 
(CAGI.i.714). </p>
<p>The people of Kusinārā are called 
Kosinārakā. E.g., D.ii.167.</p>
