  <h2>Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once, when the Buddha was staying at the 
Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu, Pajāpatī Gotamī offered him two lengths of cloth 
woven by herself on her own loom. The Buddha asked her to present her gift to 
the Confraternity of monks rather than to him, for she would thereby gain 
greater merit. He then proceeded to describe the different kinds of recipients 
of gifts, the different kinds of givers and the degrees of purity in gifts (M.iii.253ff).</p>
<p>The sutta is found word for word in the 
Sūtrālankāra (Sylvan Levi: JA.1908, xx.99) and is 
often quoted. E.g., Mil.258; MA.i.152; also included in anthologies — e.g., the 
Sutta-Sangaha.</p>
