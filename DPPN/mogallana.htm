<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Mahā-Moggallāna</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Moggallāna.</b> A celebrated Pāli grammarian of the 
twelfth century. P.L.C. 179f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Moggallāna.</b> Thera of Ceylon, author of the 
Abhidhānappadīpikā. P.L.C. 187ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Moggallāna.</b> Younger son of Dhātusena. When his 
brother, Kassapa, took Dhātusena captive, Moggallāna fled to Jambudīpa. He 
collected troops, and, in the eighteenth year of Kassapa’s reign, landed in 
Ceylon with twelve friends, counting on the support of the Niganthas. He lived 
for a time at Kuthārī vihāra in Ambatthakola making preparations. Kassapa came 
out of Sīhagiri to meet him, and, being defeated in battle, committed suicide. 
Moggallāna thereupon became king as Moggallāna I., making Anurādhapura once more 
the capital. At first he showed great cruelty to his father’s enemies, earning 
the title of “Rakkhasa,” but later he became gentle and engaged himself in good 
works. He patronized the Dhammaruci and Sāgalika schools and gave them the Dalha&nbsp; 
and Dāthakondañña vihāras at Sīhagiri. To Mahānāma, incumbent of Dīghāsana (? 
Dīghāsanda) vihāra he gave the Pabbata-vihāra, and the Rājñī nunnery to the 
Sāgalika nuns. In Moggallāna’s reign, Silākāla (Amba Sāmanera) brought the 
Buddha’s Hair relic to Ceylon. Moggallāna instituted celebrations in its honour 
and gave them into the charge of Silākāla, who left the Order and became his 
sword bearer (asiggāhaka). Migāra and Uttara were two of his generals. He 
reigned for eighteen years (496 513 A.C.). (Cv.xxxviii.80, 86ff., 96, 108; 
xxxix.20ff). Moggallāna’s sister married Upatissa III. Cv.xli.6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Moggallāna.</b> Eldest son of Ambasāmanera Silākāla. 
He was made Ādipāda and put in charge of the Eastern Province. He had two 
brothers, Dāthāpabhuti and Upatissa. On the death of Silākāla the former seized 
the throne and murdered Upatissa. Moggallāna marched against him with an army 
and challenged him to single combat. The challenge was accepted, and the 
brothers fought, each on an elephant. Dātāpabhuti was defeated and killed 
himself, and Moggallāna became king as Moggallāna II., also known as Culla 
Moggallāna. He was a great poet and a very good man. He held recitals of the 
Pitakas and the Commentaries in various parts of the Island and encouraged the 
study of the Dhamma. He once composed a poem in praise of the Dhamma and recited 
it while seated on the back of his elephant.</p>
<p>By means of damming up the Kadamba River, he constructed 
three tanks — Pattapāsāna, Dhanavāpi and 
Garītara. He ruled for twenty years (537 56), and was succeeded by his son 
Kittisirimegha. Cv.xli.33f., 43 63.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Moggallāna.</b> A general of Aggabodhi II. He 
revolted against Sanghatissa, and, after some reverses, defeated him, with the 
help of the treacherous senāpati, at Pācīnatissapabbata. He then became king as 
Moggallāna III. and was known as Dabba Moggallāna (Cv.xliv.63). He did many good 
deeds, among them being the construction of the Moggallāna , Pitthigāma&nbsp; 
and Vatagāma vihāras. He made Sanghatissa’s senāpati ruler of Malaya, but later 
quarrelled with him and had his hands and feet cut off. The senāpati’s son rose 
in revolt and killed the king near Sīhagiri. Moggallāna ruled for six years (511-17 
A.C.). Cv.xliv.3-62.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Moggallāna.</b> Son of Lokītā and Kassapa. Loka was 
his brother. Moggallāna was known by the title of Mahāsāmi (see Cv. Trs.i.195, 
n. 5) and lived in Rohana. He married Lokitā, daughter of Buddhā, and had four 
sons: Kitti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.), Mitta, Mahinda and Rakkhita. 
Cv.lvii.29f., 41f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Moggallāna</b>. An eminent Thera who was associated 
with Mahā Kassapa in the Council held at Pulatthipura under the patronage of 
Parakkamabāhu I. for the purification of the Order. Cv.lxxviii.9.</p>
