  <h2>Catuposathika Jātaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This is given as the title of the four 
hundred and forty-first Jātaka and it is there stated that it will be described 
in the Punnaka Jātaka (J.iv.14).</p>
<p>No such separate Jātaka exists and it 
is, probably, another name for the <a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm" title="vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm">Vidhurapandita Jātaka</a>, which, in its present 
form, seems to be a conglomeration of various legends which were once separate 
stories, each with its own title. The Catuposathika Jātaka was evidently one 
such story, which was later included in the Vidhura Jātaka, as its first 
section, and came to be known as the Catuposathikakhanda (see below) of that 
Jātaka. The first stanza of the Catuposathika Jātaka is quoted in the 
<a href="catuposathika_khanda.htm" title="c/catuposathika_khanda.htm">Catuposathika-khanda</a>. J.vi.257.</p>
