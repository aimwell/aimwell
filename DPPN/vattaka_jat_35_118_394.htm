<p><b>1. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 35).</b> The Bodhisatta was once 
born as a quail, and before he was old enough to fly, fire broke out in the 
forest wherein his nest was. Seeing no means of escape, he made an Act of Truth 
(sacca-kiriyā), calling to mind the holiness of the Buddhas and their doctrines. 
The fire retreated to a distance of sixteen lengths and then extinguished 
itself. The story was related in reference to a fire which broke out in the 
jungle when the Buddha was travelling in Magadha with a large company of monks. 
Some of the monks were frightened and suggested various methods for putting out 
the fire, while others said they should seek the Buddha’s protection. This they 
did and the Buddha took them to a certain spot, where he halted. The flames came 
no nearer than sixteen lengths from where they were standing, and in approaching 
the spot extinguished themselves. When the monks marvelled at the great power of 
the Buddha, he told them the story of the past and said that, owing to his Act 
of Truth as a quail, that spot would never be harmed by flames during the whole 
of this kappa. J.i.212ff.; cp.i.172.</p>

<p><b>2. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 118).</b> The Bodhisatta was 
once born as a quail, and was caught by a fowler who sold birds after fattening 
them. The Bodhisatta, knowing this, starved himself, and when the fowler took 
him out of the cage to examine his condition the quail flew away and rejoined 
his companions.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a young man of Sāvatthi 
called Uttarasetthiputta. He had descended from the Brahma world and had no 
desire for women. Once, during the Kattika festival, his friends sent him a 
gaily decked woman to entice him, but he gave her some money and sent her away. 
As she came out of his house, a nobleman saw her and took her with him. When she 
failed to return, her mother complained to the king, and the setthiputta was 
told to restore her. On failing to do so, he was taken off for execution. He 
resolved that if by any means he could escape execution he would become a monk. 
The girl noticed the crowd following the young man, and on learning the reason 
she revealed her identity and he was set free. He, thereupon, joined the Order 
and soon after became an arahant. J.i.432ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 394).</b> The Bodhisatta was 
once a forest quail living on rough grass and seeds. A greedy crow of Benares, 
who was in the forest, saw the quail and thought that the good condition of his 
body was due to rich food. The quail, seeing the crow, talked to him, and then 
the crow discovered that the quail had a beautiful body not because he ate rich 
food, but because he had contentment of mind and freedom from fear.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a greedy monk who is 
identified with the crow. J.iii.312f.</p>

<p><b>4. Vattaka Jātaka.</b> See also the Sammodamāna Jātaka, 
which is evidently also referred to as the Vattaka Jātaka. E.g., J.v.414; 
DhA.i.46; SNA.ii.358.</p>
