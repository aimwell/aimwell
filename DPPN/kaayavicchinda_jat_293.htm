<p>The Bodhisatta was once a brahmin of 
Benares and fell sick of jaundice. The physicians failed to cure him, and his 
family were in despair. He resolved that if he recovered he would embrace the 
religious life; soon afterwards he was cured, became an ascetic and cultivated 
the abhiññā and the samāpatti.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a man 
in Sāvatthi who had a like experience. He entered the Order and became an 
arahant (J.ii.436-8). v.l. Kayanibbinda.</p>
