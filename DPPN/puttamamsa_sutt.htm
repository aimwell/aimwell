  <h2>Puttamamsa Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The four kinds of food&nbsp; material food, contact, will, 
and consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp; and how they should be regarded. Material food 
should be eaten only to maintain existence, as parents might eat the flesh of 
their own son in the desert. Contact should be regarded as a cow with a sore 
hide&nbsp;&nbsp; exposed always to creatures and insects who devour her. Will 
should be regarded as a pit of glowing coal; and consciousness as a robber, 
brought before the king and smitten with darts at morning, noon, and evening. 
S.ii.97 ff.</p>
