<p><b>1. Sukkā Therī. </b>She belonged to a householder’s 
family of Rājagaha, and, very impressed by the Buddha’s majesty when he visited 
Rājagaha, she became a lay believer. Later she heard Dhammadinnā preach, and 
entered the Order under her, attaining arahantship not long after.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha she had been a nun, and, 
after a sojourn in Tusita, a nun again in the time of Sikhī, Vessabhū, 
Kakusandha, Konāgamana and Kassapa Buddhas.</p>
<p>In her last life she was a great preacher, at the head of 
five hundred nuns. One particular sermon to the nuns is specially mentioned, and 
a tree sprite, living at the end of the nun’s cankamana, went about Rājagaha, 
singing Sukkā’s praises. People, hearing the sprite, flocked to hear Sukkā.</p>
<p>Thig.vss.54-6; ThigA.57f ; Ap.ii.605f.; the incident of 
the tree sprite’s praise is twice mentioned in the Samyutta as well. There the 
sprite is called a Yakkha (S.i.212); in the second account (ibid., 213) it says 
that the Yakkha’s praise was owing to a meal given to Sukkā by a lay follower of 
Rājagaha.</p>

<p><b>2. Sukkā</b>. A class of 
Devas who were present, in the company of the Veghanasā, at the preaching of the 
Mahāsamaya Sutta. D.ii.261.</p>
