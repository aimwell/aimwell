<p><b>1. Bhāgineyya Sangharakkhita Thera.</b> He was the nephew of the Elder Sangharakkhita, hence his 
name. </p>
<p>Once, at a certain monastery he was given two sets of 
robes, and immediately put away the better set to be given as a present to his 
uncle and teacher. At the end of the rains, he went to the monastery of his 
uncle, and, having waited upon him, offered his gift. But his uncle refused it 
in spite of the youth’s repeated request. Thereupon the nephew became sulky, and 
while fanning the Elder, started to think what he could do if he became a 
layman. He would sell his robe, buy a she goat, get rich thereby, marry, and 
have a son. While taking the child out for a walk, he would ask to be allowed to 
carry him, his wife would refuse and carry him herself. Then she would drop the 
child and her husband would hit her. So thinking, in his absent-mindedness, the 
youth hit the Elder with the fan. The Elder read his thoughts and rebuked him. 
The youth then started to run away, but the monks caught him and brought him 
before the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him on the difficulty of keeping the 
mind in check. At the end of the sermon the youth became a sotāpanna.
