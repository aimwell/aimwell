<p><b>1. Asita.</b>-Often called the Buddhist 
Simeon, though the comparison is not quite correct. He was a sage and the 
chaplain of <a href="siihahanu.htm" title="s/siihahanu.htm">Sīhahanu</a>, father of <a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a>. He was the teacher of the Suddhodana, 
and later his chaplain. He came morning and evening to see the king, Suddhodana, 
who showed him as great respect as he had while yet his pupil; this, we are 
told, is a characteristic of Sākiyan kings.  </p>
<p>With the king’s leave, Asita renounced 
the world and lived in the king’s pleasance. In due course he developed various 
iddhi powers. Thenceforward he would often spend the day in the deva worlds. 
Once, while in Tāvatimsa, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the 
gods engaged in great rejoicing. On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, 
destined to become the Buddha, had been born. Immediately he went to 
Suddhodana’s home and asked to see the babe. From the auspicious marks on its 
body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, 
but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Arūpa world and 
would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad. 
Having reassured the king regarding the babe’s future, Asita sought his sister’s 
son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha’s 
teaching when the time came. Later Asita was born in the Arūpa world (Sn., 
pp.131-36; SnA.ii.483ff.; J.i.54f).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.483), 
Asita was so-called because of his dark complexion. He also had a second name, 
Kanha Devala (SnA.ii.487). Other names for him were Kanha Siri (Sn.v.689), Siri 
Kanha (SnA.487) and Kāla Devala (J.i.54).</p>
<p>He is evidently to be distinguished from 
<a href="asita_devala.htm" title="ay/asita_devala.htm">Asita Devala</a>, also called Kāla Devala.</p>
<p>The Lalita Vistara has two versions of 
Asita’s prophecy, one in prose and one in verse, which, in their chief details, 
differ but slightly from the Pāli version. In the former his nephew is called 
Naradatta, and Asita himself is represented as being a great sage dwelling in 
the Himālaya but unknown to Suddhodana.</p>
<p>Here is evidently a confusion of his 
story with that of Asita Devala. In the Mahāvastu version (ii.30f) he is spoken 
of as the son of a brahmin of Ujjeni, and he lives in a hermitage in the Vindhyā 
mountains. It is noteworthy that in the Jātaka version he is called, not an isi, 
but a tāpasa, an ascetic practising austerities. And there we are told that when 
the king brought the boy, the future Buddha, and prepared to make him do 
reverence to the ascetic, the babe’s feet turned up and placed themselves on the 
ascetic’s head. For there is no one fit to be reverenced by a Bodhisatta, and 
had they put the babe’s head at the feet of the ascetic, the ascetic’s head 
would have split into seven pieces.</p>
<p>The tāpasa could see forty kappas into 
the past and forty kappas into the future. J.i.54-5. See Thomas, op. cit., pp.

a list of Pacceka Buddhas (M.iii.70; ApA.i.107).</p>

<p><b>3. Asita.</b>-A garland-maker in the time of 
Sikhī Buddha. While taking a garland to the palace, he saw the Buddha and 
offered it to him. As a result, twenty-five kappas ago he became a king named Dvebhāra. In the present age he was known as Sukatāveliya Thera (Ap.i.217).</p>
