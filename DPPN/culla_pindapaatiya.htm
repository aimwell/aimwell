<p>A monk mentioned in the Commentaries (E.g., 
MA.i.355) in explaining the term mutta-muttaka. A certain 
lay-woman waited on him for twelve years. One day a fire broke out in the 
village and burnt her house, together with those of others. The monks who were 
fed at neighbouring houses went there to enquire whether anything had been 
served, but Tissa did not arrive until the mealtime, and when given a meal which 
the woman had prepared with great difficulty, ate it and went away without a 
word. The woman, however, was not a whit disturbed by the taunts of her 
neighbours.</p>
<p>This may be the Elder who, in the 
Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.21f), is mentioned as 
having resided in Gāmendavālavihāra in Rohana and ordained Milakkha-Tissa. The 
same Commentary (i.367) mentions a Cullapindapātiya-Tissa of Girivihāra in 
(Ceylon). He, with his divine eye, saw a Tamil gate-keeper of Madhuanganagāma 
who, having been a fisherman for fifty years, lay dying. The Elder went to his 
house and made him repeat the Refuges and the Precepts. The man could not repeat 
beyond the first Precept, but he was born after death in the Cātummahārājika-world, 
and came to tell the Elder about it.</p>
<p>The Visuddhi Magga (p.116) speaks of an 
Elder of the same name who had three pupils. They came to him and said they were 
prepared to do anything whatever for his sake, even to suffer torture and die. 
He thought them “possible fellows” and preached to them, whereupon they became 
arahants. The same Elder it may be who saw an elephant-corpse in Kāladīghavāpi 
Lake and developed his meditation on the “wormful abomination (Ibid., p.191).</p>
