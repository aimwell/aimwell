<p><b>1. Udena.</b>-King of 
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. He was the 
son of <a href="parantapa.htm" title="pa/parantapa.htm">Parantapa</a>. His mother, when pregnant with him, was carried off by a 
monster-bird and deposited on a tree near the residence of 
<a href="allakappa.htm" title="am/allakappa.htm">Allakappa</a>. The child 
was born in a storm (utu?) — hence the name. Allakappa, having discovered the 
mother and child, took them under his protection. One day, when Udena was grown 
up, Allakappa saw by the conjunction of the planets that Parantapa had died. 
When he announced the news, Udena’s mother revealed to him her identity. 
Allakappa taught Udena the various charms he knew for taming elephants and sent 
him to <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>, with a large following of elephants, to claim the kingdom. Some 
time after he became king, Udena appointed <a href="ghosaka_setthi.htm" title="g/ghosaka_setthi.htm">Ghosaka</a> as his treasurer, and one 
day, having seen Ghosaka’s adopted daughter, <a href="samavati.htm" title="sa/samavati.htm">Sāmāvatī</a>, going to the river to 
bathe, sent for her and married her. Later he married, in very romantic 
circumstances, <a href="vaasuladattaa.htm" title="va/vaasuladattaa.htm">Vāsuladattā</a>, daughter of 
<a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Canda Pajjota</a>, king of 
<a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>. The 
Dhammapadatthakathā (i.161ff) contains a whole story-cycle of Udena from which 
these details, except where otherwise stated, are taken. For details of other 
persons mentioned in the article and their encounters with Udena, see under 
their respective names.</p>
<p>Udena had another wife, 
<a href="maagandiyaa.htm" title="ma/maagandiyaa.htm">Māgandiyā</a>, who took advantage of her new position to wreak vengeance on the Buddha 
for having once slighted her. When Sāmāvatī was converted to the Buddha’s faith 
by her handmaiden <a href="khujjuttaraa.htm" title="ku/khujjuttaraa.htm">Khujjuttarā</a>, Māgandiyā tried to poison the king’s mind against 
her, but the attempt was frustrated, though Sāmāvatī very nearly lost her life 
at the king’s hand. When Udena realised how grievously he had wronged her, he 
promised to grant her a boon, and, as the result of her choice, the Buddha sent 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> with five hundred monks to the palace every day, to preach to the women 
of the court. Udena himself does not seem to have been interested in religion. 
Once when be discovered that the women of the court had given five hundred 
costly robes to Ānanda, he was annoyed, but when in answer to his questions 
Ānanda explained to him that nothing given to members of the Order was wasted, 
he was pleased and himself made a similar offering of robes to Ānanda. Mentioned 
also in Vin.ii.291. The incident took place after the Buddha’s death.</p>
<p>His encounter in his park the 
<a href="udakavana.htm" title="u/udakavana.htm">Udakavana</a> with <a href="pindola.htm" title="pu/pindola.htm">Pindola Bhāradvāja</a>, in somewhat similar circumstances, did not, 
however, end so happily. Udena’s women had given Pindola their robes, and when 
the king questioned Pindola as to the appropriateness of the gift, he remained 
silent. Udena threatened to have him bitten by red ants; but Pindola vanished 
through the air. (SnA.ii.514-5; SA.iii.27; in a previous birth too, as Mandavya, 
Udena had been guilty of abusing holy men, see the 
<a href="maatanga_jat_497.htm" title="ma/maatanga_jat_497.htm">Mātanga Jātaka</a>, J.iv.375ff). 
Later (S.iv.110f) we find him visiting Pindola again on friendly terms and 
receiving information as to how young members of the Order succeeded in curbing 
their passions in spite of their youth. In this context Udena calls himself a 
follower of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Udena had a son named Bodhi (J.iii.157), 
among whose activities the building of a palace, called Kokanada, is specially 
recorded. It is clear from the incident of the presentation of robes to Ānanda, 
referred to above, as well as by a definite statement to that effect contained 
in the Petavatthu Commentary (p.140), that Udena survived the Buddha; but 
whether his son Bodhi succeeded him or not is not known.</p>
<p>Among Udena’s possessions mention is 
made of his bow, requiring one thousand men to string it (DhA.i.216), and of his 
elephant Bhaddavatikā (J.iv.384).</p>
<p>Udena is sometimes referred to as 
Vamsarājā (king of the Vamsas) (E.g., J.iv.375; the Dvy. e.g., 528, calls him 
Vatsarājā), the Vamsas or the Vacchas being the inhabitants of Kosambī.  </p>
<p>In the 
Udāna Commentary (p.382) he is called Vajjirājā. The Milinda-pañha (p.291) tells 
a story of a woman called <a href="gopaalamaataa.htm" title="g/gopaalamaataa.htm">Gopāla-mātā</a>, who became a queen of Udena. She was the 
daughter of peasant-folk, and, being poor, she sold her hair for eight pennies, 
with which she gave a meal to Mahā Kaccāna and his seven companions. That very 
day she became Udena’s queen.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Udena.</b>-A thera. He once stayed, after 
the Buddha’s death, in the Khemiyambavana near Benares. There the brahmin 
Ghotamukha visited him. Their conversation is recorded in the 
<a href="ghotamukha_s.htm" title="g/ghotamukha_s.htm">Ghotamukha Sutta</a>. At the end of Udena’s sermon, the brahmin offered to share with him the 
daily allowance he received from the Anga king. This offer was refused, and at 
Udena’s suggestion Ghotamukha built an assembly-hall for monks at Pātaliputta; 
this assembly-hall was named after him (M.ii.157ff).</p>
<p>See also Udena (9).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Udena.</b>-An upāsaka of Kosala. He built 
a vihāra for the Order, and he invited monks for its dedication, which took 
place during the Vassa. It being against the rules to go on a journey before the 
Vassa, the monks asked him to postpone the dedication. This annoyed him. When 
the matter was referred to the Buddha, he altered the rule so that a journey 
lasting not more than seven days could be undertaken during the Vassa. 
Vin.i.139.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Udena Thera.</b>-The personal attendant 
of <a href="sumana.htm" title="s/sumana.htm">Sumana</a> Buddha. Bu.v.24; J.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Udena.</b>-A king. He joined the Order 
under <a href="kondanna.htm" title="ku/kondanna.htm">Kondañña</a> Buddha, with ninety crores of followers, all of whom became 
arahants. BuA.111.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Udena.</b>-A yakkha. See Udena Cetiya.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Udena.</b>-A king, father of 
<a href="siddhattha.htm" title="s/siddhattha.htm">Siddhattha</a> 
Buddha (Bu.xvii.13); also called Jayasena (BuA.187).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Udena.</b>-A king, a former birth of Ukkhepakata-vaccha Thera (ThagA.i.148), called in the Apadāna (i.56), 
Ekatthambhika.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Udena Thera</b>.-An arahant, probably 
identical with Udena (2). During the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a hermit, 
with eighty-four thousand others, living in a hermitage near Paduma-pabbata in 
the Himālaya. Having heard the Buddha’s praises from a yakkha, he visited 
Padumuttara, offered him a lotus flower and spoke verses in praise of him. 
Ap.ii.362ff.</p>
