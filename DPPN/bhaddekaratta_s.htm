  <h2>Bhaddekaratta Sutta</h2>

<p>Preached at <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>. The true saint is he who does not 
hanker after the past and does not long for the future. He is not swept away by 
present states of consciousness, but scanning his heart with insight, he 
struggles unceasingly to win eternal Changelessness (M.iii.187 ff). </p>
<p>This sutta was learned by <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> and used by him in an 
exposition to his colleagues. This exposition was approved by the Buddha and 
came to be called the <a href="aananda_bhaddekaratta_s.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda_bhaddekaratta_s.htm">Ānanda-Bhaddekaratta Sutta</a> (M.iii.189 ff). One day, as
<a href="samiddhi.htm" title="sa/samiddhi.htm">Samiddhi</a> was drying himself after bathing at 
<a href="tapodaa.htm" title="t/tapodaa.htm">Tapodā</a> in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, a deity 
questioned him on this sutta, and he had to confess his ignorance. Samiddhi then 
went to the Buddha and asked him about the sutta, and the Buddha preached to him 
only the verses, with no explanation. The monks, who were present, thereupon 
asked <a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> for a detailed exposition. He gave it, and the monks referred 
it to the Buddha who advised them to remember it. This exposition came to be 
called the <a href="maha_kaccana_bhadd_s.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccana_bhadd_s.htm">Mahā Kaccāna Bhaddekaratta Sutta</a> (M.iii.192 ff). </p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="lomasakangiya_th.htm" title="l/lomasakangiya_th.htm">Lomasakangiya</a> was asked about the sutta by the 
god <a href="candana.htm" title="c/candana.htm">Candana</a>, when he was staying in the Nigrodhārāma at Kapilavatthu. He, in his 
turn, had to confess his ignorance, and Candana taught him the verses, which, he 
said, were uttered by the Buddha during his visit to Tāvatimsa. When he went to 
preach the Abhidhamma. The Commentary (MA.ii.962) explains that the Buddha 
preached this sutta for the benefit of devas who could not understand the 
Abhidhamma. Lomasakangiya learnt the verses, and, going to the Buddha, 
questioned him concerning them. The Buddha made them clear to him. This account 
is called the Lomasakangiya-Bhaddekaratta Sutta 
(M.iii.199ff). </p>
<p>Extracts from the Bhaddekaratta Sutta are uttered by 
speakers in the <a href="hatthipala_jat_509.htm" title="h/hatthipala_jat_509.htm">Hatthipāla Jātaka</a> (J.iv.481) and the
<a href="mahakapi_jat_407_516.htm" title="maha/mahakapi_jat_407_516.htm">Mahākapi Jātaka</a> (J.v.66).</p>
