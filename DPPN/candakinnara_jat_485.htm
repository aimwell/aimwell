  <h2>Candakinnara Jātaka (No.485)</h2>

</ul>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta, born as a kinnara 
named Canda, lived with his mate Candā in the Canda mountain in Himavā. One day, 
while they were disporting themselves near a&nbsp; little stream, singing and 
dancing, the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, who had gone hunting, saw Candā and fell in love 
with her. So he shot Canda with an arrow, and when Candā lamented aloud at the 
sight of her dead husband the king revealed himself and offered her his love and 
his kingdom. Canda scorned the offer and protested to the gods that they should 
have allowed harm to befall her husband. Sakka’s throne was heated by her such 
great loyalty and, coming in the guise of a brahmin, he restored to Canda his 
life.</p>
<p>The king was Anuruddha and Candā was 
Rāhulamātā. The story was related by the Buddha when he visited his father’s 
palace at Kapilavatthu and heard from Suddhodana how devotedly Rāhulamātā had 
continued to love the Buddha. He said it was not the first time that she had 
shown her undying affection. J.iv.282ff; DhA.i.97.</p>
