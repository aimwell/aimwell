<p>A general of Gajabāhu, captured by the 
Senāpati Deva and sent to Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxx.143) Later he seems to have 
been appointed general by Parakkamabāhu himself and given the title of Lankāpura, 
for we find him fighting on the side of the king and being entrusted with 
important campaigns. Cv.lxxii.39, 222, 272; lxxv.181.</p>
