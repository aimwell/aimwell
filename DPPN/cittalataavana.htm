<p>1. Cittalatāvana.-A pleasance, five 
hundred leagues in extent, in Tāvatimsa. It came into being through the good 
deeds performed by Māgha’s wife, Cittā (DhA.i.271-5; J.i.202). It is said 
(VvA.94) that the place was so called not only because of its association with 
Cittā, but also because there grew in it various creepers bearing many coloured 
flowers. In the pleasaunce is born the Āsāvatī creeper which blossoms only once 
in a thousand years. ThagA.i.365; J.iii.250.</p>
<p>2. Cittalatāvana.-A park laid out by 
Parakkamabāhu 1. Cv.lxxix.7.</p>
