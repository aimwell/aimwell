</ul>
<p>A fellow-dweller of Anuruddha. On one 
occasion when the Buddha asks Mahā Kassapa to preach to the monks, the latter 
reports that it is impossible to talk to them because monks like Bhanda, 
colleague of Ānanda, and Abhiñjika, were engaged in wordy warfare.</p>
<p>The Buddha sends for them and admonishes 
them. Having heard his discourse, they express regret for their behaviour and 
promise to cultivate self-restraint in the future (Abhijika, Ābhiñjika). 
S.ii.204-5.</p>
