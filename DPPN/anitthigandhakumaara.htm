<p><b>1. Anitthigandhakumāra.</b>-The Bodhisatta, 
born as the son of a king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He hated the sight of women until he was 
seduced by a dancing-girl. He was banished from home together with the girl, and 
they lived in a forest-hut, where the girl tempted an ascetic and robbed him of 
his mystic power. The Bodhisatta, realising this, gave up the woman, and himself 
became an ascetic. The story is told in the 
<a href="culla_palobhana_jat_263.htm" title="c/culla_palobhana_jat_263.htm">Cullapalobhana-Jātaka</a>. J.ii.329-31.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Anitthigandhakumāra.</b>-Similar to the 
above, the story being called the Mahāpalobhana-Jātaka. J.iv.469-73.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Anitthigandhakumāra.</b>-Another 
Anitthigandha, of Sāvatthi. He refused to marry unless a woman could be found 
rivalling in beauty an image which he had made. Envoys were sent out and, in 
Sāgala, they discovered a sixteen-year-old girl to answer to the desired 
qualifications. The marriage was arranged, but the girl, being very delicate, 
died on the way to the bridegroom’s house. On learning the news of her death he 
was sorely grieved and gave himself up to despair. The Buddha, seeing his 
capabilities, visited his home and preached to him. At the end of the sermon he 
became a Stream-enterer.</p>
<p>The story in which this account is given 
is called Anitthigandhakumāra Vatthu. DhA.iii.281-4. Compare with this the story 
of the <a href="kusa_jat_531.htm" title="ku/kusa_jat_531.htm">Kusa Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Anitthigandhakumāra.</b>-A Pacceka 
Buddha. He was the son of the King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. In a previous birth he had been a 
monk for 20,000 years, during the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha. His story is 
very similar to that of No. 3 above, the wife chosen being the daughter of Maddava, King of Sāgala. When the princess died, on her way to be married, the 
prince gave himself up to contemplation and became a Pacceka Buddha (SnA.67ff.; 
ApA.i.126-7). A stanza attributed to him is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta. Sn.p.6, v.36.</p>
