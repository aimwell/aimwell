<p>The eldest of the <a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">Andhakavenhudāsaputtā</a>. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="ghata_jat_355_454.htm" title="g/ghata_jat_355_454.htm">Ghata Jātaka</a> (No. 454) relates how, when Vāsudeva’s 
son died and Vāsudeva gave himself up to despair, his brother 
<a href="ghata.htm" title="g/ghata.htm">Ghatapandita</a> brought him to his senses by feigning madness. </p>
<p>Vāsudeva’s minister was Rohineyya. Vāsudeva is addressed 
(J.iv.84; he is called Kanha at J.vi.421) as Kanha and again as Kesava. The 
scholiast explains (J.iv.84) that he is called Kanha because he belonged to the 
Kanhāyanagotta, and Kesava because he had beautiful hair (kesasobhanatāya). 
These names, however, give support to the theory (see 
<a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">Andhakavenhudāsaputtā</a>, 
No.1) that the story of Vāsudeva was associated with the legend of Krsna. 
</p>
<p>In the <a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahāummagga Jātaka</a> (J.vi.421) it is stated that Jambāvatī, mother of King Sivi, was the consort of Vāsudeva Kanha. The scholiast 
identifies this Vāsudeva with the eldest of the Andhakavenhudāsaputtā, and says 
that Jambāvatī was a candalī. Vāsudeva fell in love with her because of her 
great beauty and married her in spite of her caste. Their son was 
<a href="sivi.htm" title="s/sivi.htm">Sivi</a>, who 
later succeeded to his father’s throne at <a href="dvaaravatii.htm" title="d/dvaaravatii.htm">Dvāravatī</a>. </p>
<p>Vāsudeva is identified with <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>. J.iv.89.</p>

<p><b>Vāsudevavattikā.</b> Probably followers of Vāsudeva (? 
Krsna); they are mentioned with Baladevavattikā and others in a list of 
samanabrāhmanāvattasuddhikā. Nid.i.89; cf. Vāsudevāytana at DhSA., p.141.</p>
