<p><b>1. Bhava Sutta</b>. A discussion between Sāriputta 
  and Jambukhādaka on “becoming.” S.iv.258.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhava Sutta</b>. On the three kinds of bhava&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  in the kāma world, the rūpa world, and the arūpa world. S.v.56.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhava Sutta.</b> There are three kinds of bhava: 
  kāma, rūpa, and arūpa; these can be given up by training in further virtue, 
  further thought, and further insight. A.iii.444.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhava Sutta.</b> Ānanda asks the Buddha to what 
  extent there is “becoming.” There will be “becoming” as long as there are 
  worlds of sense, of form, and of formlessness; action is the field, 
  consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture which bring about rebirth in 
  these worlds. A.i.223 f.</p>
