<p><b>1. Subha.</b> A Pacceka Buddha. M.iii.70; ApA.i.106.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Subha.</b> A young man (mānava) called Todeyyaputta. 
He once visited the Buddha in Sāvatthi, asking him various questions. The 
interview is described in the Subha Sutta (q.v.). At the end of the discourse he 
declared himself the Buddha’s follower. While on his way back from the city, he 
met Jānussoni, and, on being asked what he thought of the Buddha, spoke of him 
in terms of the highest praise, saying that none but Gotama’s own peer could 
utter sufficient praise of him (M.i.196f., 208f.; Jānussoni addresses him as 
Bhāradvāja). Subha is described (MA.ii.802; cf. M.i.202) as the son of the 
brahmin Todeyya (q.v.) of Tudigāma.</p>
<p>Elsewhere however, a different account is given of his 
conversion. (DA.ii.384f.; cf. MA.ii.963f., which adds that the Buddha proved the 
identity of the dog by getting it to indicate the place where Todeyya’s treasure 
lay buried). Subba’s father was a very rich merchant, chaplain to Pasenadi, but 
a great miser. After death he was born as a dog in the same home. One day, when 
the Buddha was going his alms round in Tudigāma near Sāvatthi, he arrived at 
Subha’s house. The dog saw the Buddha and barked, and the Buddha addressed it as 
“Todeyya.” The dog thereupon ran into the house and lay on a bed, from which no 
one could drive it away. When Subha asked the cause of the uproar, he was told 
the story. Thereupon he was very angry, saying that his father had been born in 
the Brahmaloka, and, in order to refute the Buddha, he visited the monastery. 
This was the occasion for the preaching of the Subha Sutta. Soon after the 
Buddha’s death, when Ānanda, was staying in Sāvatthi, Subha sent a young man to 
Ānanda, with his respects and an invitation to his house. Ānanda, having taken 
medicine, did not go that day. But he went the next day, accompanied by a monk 
of Cetiya (Cetaka). Their conversation is recorded in the Subha Sutta (2) 
(D.i.204f). See also Cūlakammavibhahga Sutta, which too was preached to Subha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Subha.</b> A palace guard, son of Datta. He closely 
resembled King Yasalālaka-Tissa in appearance, and the king used to place him on 
the throne, decked in royal ornaments, and watch the ministers doing obeisance 
to him, while he himself took the guard’s place. One day, while Subha was on the 
throne, he reprimanded the king, disguised as a guard, for smiling 
disrespectfully, and had him led away and executed before the truth was 
discovered. Subha then became king and ruled for six years (120-6 A.C.). He 
built the Subharāja-parivena, the Vallī-vihāra, the Ekadvāra vihāra and the 
Nandīgāmaka-vihāra. He was deposed by Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.51ff.; Dpv.xxi.45). His 
daughter married Vankanāsika-Tissa. She had been adopted by a bricklayer, but 
Vasabha discovered her identity and married her to his son. Her good fortune was 
owing to a meal she had given to an arahant thera. For details see 
Mhv.xxxv.101ff.; see also Cv.xxxviii.13f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Subha.</b> A palace occupied by Kondañña Buddha 
before his renunciation. Bu.iii.26.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Subha.</b> A palace occupied by Gotama Buddha before 
his renunciation. BuA.230; but Bu.xxvi.14 calls it Subhata.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Subha. </b>A senāpati who, during the thirteenth 
century, built a fortress in Subhagiri. Cc.lxxxi.4.</p>
