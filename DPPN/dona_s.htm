  <h2>Dona Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>A brahmin, Dona (probably identical with 
Dona 1 above), visits the Buddha and asks if it be true that the Buddha does not 
honour brahmins. The Buddha tells him that there are five kinds of brahmins — 
the Brahma-like, the deva-like, the bound, the breaker of bonds, and the brahmin-outcast 
- and, at Dona’s request, describes these in detail (A.iii.223ff). The 
classification of brahmins given in this sutta is often referred to. E.g., 
SNA.i.318, 325, etc.</p>
