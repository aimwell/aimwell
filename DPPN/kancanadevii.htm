<p><b>1. Kañcanadevī </b></p>
<p>Daughter of the king of Benares and 
sister of the Bodhisatta, Mahākadeana. </p>
<p>With her brothers she renounced the 
world and lived in a hermitage after her parents' death. </p>
<p>Her story is told in the Bhisa Jātaka 
(J.iv.305ff). </p>
<p>She was a previous birth of Uppalavannā 
(J.iv.314).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Kañcanadevī</b></p>
<p>Daughter of the king of Devaputta&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On the day of her birth jewels fell from 
the sky and her body was so bright that no lamps were needed when she was by. 
She entered the Order when she grew up and became an arahant. </p>
<p>In her past birth, when she was 
listening to a sermon at the end of celebrations held at Devaputta in honour of 
the Bowl Relic, a Nāga king fell in love with her. When she refused his 
attentions, the Nāga wrapt her body with his coils, but she continued to listen 
unmoved. By power of her virtue the Nāga was subdued, and he paid her great 
honour by means of an Udakapūjā. Ras.i.34f.</p>
