<p>A number of Elders* were talking on the 
Abhidhamma in the Migadāya in <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>, when 
<a href="citta.htm" title="c/citta.htm">Citta-Hatthisāriputta</a> broke 
into their talk. <a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahā Kotthita</a> rebuked him, and, on being remonstrated with by 
Citta’s friends, Mahā Kotthita implied by means of various similes that Citta 
was not the wise man they thought him to be, and that he would, without doubt, 
return again to the lay life. This prediction proved true, but Citta came back 
once more to the Order, and shortly afterwards became an arahant (A.iii.392ff).
</p>
<p>*The DA. (ii.378) which refers to this 
incident says that the talk took place between 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> and
<a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Kotthita</a>.</p>
