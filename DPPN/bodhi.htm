<p>He lived at <a href="sumsumaaragiri.htm" title="s/sumsumaaragiri.htm">Sumsumāragiri</a> in the 
<a href="bhagga.htm" title="b/bhagga.htm">Bhagga</a> country and built 
a palace called <a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanada</a>. When the palace was completed, the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was 
staying at <a href="bhesakalavava.htm" title="b/bhesakalavava.htm">Bhesakalāvana</a> near by, and Bodhi sent a message by 
<a href="sanjikaputta.htm" title="sa/sanjikaputta.htm">Sañjikāputta</a>, 
inviting the Buddha to the palace, that he might bless it by being its first 
occupant. The Buddha agreed to come and, the next day, arrived with the monks 
for a meal. Bodhi came, with his retinue, to meet them at the foot of the steps 
and asked the Buddha to step on to the carpeting which was spread there. Three 
times the request was made, three times the Buddha kept silence. Thereupon 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> asked for the carpeting to be removed, saying that the Buddha’s refusal 
to step thereon was as an example to future generations. After the meal, Bodhi 
had a discussion with the Buddha (Vin.ii.127f.; M.ii.91ff), recorded in the 
<a href="bodhirajakumara_s.htm" title="b/bodhirajakumara_s.htm">Bodhirājakumāra Sutta</a>.</p>
<p>The Commentary adds (MA.ii.739ff) that one of the reasons 
for the Buddha’s refusal to step on the carpet was that he knew the thoughts of 
Bodhi. Bodhi was saying to himself: “If I am to have a son, the Buddha will step 
on this carpet, if not, he will not.” The Buddha knew also that Bodhi was not 
destined to have a son because in a previous life he and his wife had lived on 
an island and eaten young birds. DhA.iii.137ff adds that the Buddha actually 
told Bodhi of the non fulfillment of his wish for a son, and related to him the 
story of his past life in which he and his wife ate birds' eggs.</p>
<p>Bodhi was the son of <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>, king of
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambi</a>, and his 
mother was the daughter of <a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Candappajjota</a>. Bodhi was skilled in the art of 
managing elephants (see also M.ii.94), which art he learned from his father, a 
master in this direction. It is said (M.ii.97)&nbsp; that, while Bodhi was yet 
in his mother’s womb, she visited the Buddha at the 
<a href="ghositaaraama.htm" title="g/ghositaaraama.htm">Ghositārāma</a> in Kosambī and 
declared that whatever child was born to her it would accept the Buddha, his 
teaching and the Order, as its abiding refuge. Later, after Bodhi’s birth, his 
nurse took him to the Buddha at Bhesakalāvana and made a similar declaration. 
When, therefore, Bodhi acknowledged the Buddha as his teacher, at the conclusion 
of the <a href="bodhirajakumara_s.htm" title="b/bodhirajakumara_s.htm">Bodhirājakumāra Sutta</a>, he was seeking the Buddha’s refuge for the third 
time.</p>
<p>Some accounts* of the building 
of Bodhi’s palace add that as it was being completed, Bodhi conceived the idea 
of killing the architect or of blinding him so that he could never design a 
similar house for anyone else. He confided this idea to 
<a href="sanjikaputta.htm" title="sa/sanjikaputta.htm">Sanjikāputta</a>, who warned 
the architect. The latter, therefore, obtained special timber from Bodhi, saying 
it was for the palace, and made out of it a wooden bird large enough to hold 
himself and his family. When it was ready, he made it fly out of the window, and 
he and his family escaped to the Himālaya country, where he founded a kingdom 
and came to be known as King <a href="katthavaahana.htm" title="ka/katthavaahana.htm">Katthavāhana</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* E.g., DhA.iii.134ff.; in J.iii.157 it is stated 
  briefly that Bodhi did actually blind the architect. In a previous birth he 
  put out the eyes of one thousand warriors. See the 
  <a href="dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm" title="d/dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm">Dhonasākha Jātaka</a>.</p>
