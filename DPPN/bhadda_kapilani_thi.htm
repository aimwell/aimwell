  <h2>Bhaddā Kapilānī Therī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The daughter of a Kosiyagotta Brahmin of 
<a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sāgala</a>, in the 
<a href="madda.htm" title="ma/madda.htm">Madda</a> country. </p>
<p>Ap.ii.583 (vs. 57) says that her mother was Sucīmatī and 
her father <a href="kapila.htm#8" title="ka/kapila.htm#8">Kapila</a>, whence, probably, her title of Kāpilānī. When the messengers 
sent by the parents of Pipphali-mānava (<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>) were wandering about seeking for a wife for him to resemble the image they 
carried with them, they discovered Bhaddā and informed Pipphali’s parents. The 
parents arranged the marriage without the knowledge of the young people and 
Bhaddā went to Pipphali’s house. There they lived together, but, by mutual 
consent, the marriage was never consummated. It was said that, she brought with 
her, on the day of her marriage, fifty thousand cartloads of wealth. When 
Pipphali desired to leave the world, making over to her his wealth, she wished 
to renounce it likewise, and together they left the house in the guise of 
recluses, their hair shorn, unobserved by any. In the village, however, they 
were recognized by their gait, and the people fell down at their feet. They 
granted freedom to all their slaves, and set forth, Pipphali leading and Bhaddā 
following close behind. On coming to a fork in the road, they agreed that he 
should take the right and she the left. In due course she came to the 
Titthiyārāma (near <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>), where she dwelt for five years, women not having 
yet been admitted to the Buddha’s Order. Later, when
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Pajāpatī Gotamī</a> had 
obtained the necessary leave, Bhaddā joined her and received ordination, 
attaining arahantship not long after. Later in the assembly, the Buddha declared 
her foremost of nuns who could recall former lives.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara Buddha</a> she was the wife of Videha, a setthi of Hamsavatī, and having heard a nun proclaimed in the first 
rank of those who could recall former lives, she resolved to acquire a similar 
rank, while her husband (Mahā Kassapa in this life) resolved to be chief among 
those who practise austere vows (dhutavādinam). Together they did many good 
deeds and were reborn in heaven.  </p>
<p>In the time of <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī Buddha</a>, the husband was 
the brahmin Ekasātaka and she was his wife. In his next birth he was king of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and she his chief queen. Together they entertained eight Pacceka Buddhas 
on a very lavish scale. In the interval between the appearance in the world of 
<a href="konaagamana.htm" title="ku/konaagamana.htm">Konāgamana</a> and <a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa Buddha</a>, the husband was a clansman and she his wife. One 
day a quarrel arose between her and her sister-in law. The latter gave alms to a 
Pacceka Buddha and Bhaddā, thinking “She will win glory for this,” took the bowl 
from her hand and filled it with mud. But later she was filled with remorse, 
took back the bowl, emptied it, scrubbed it with scented powder and, having 
filled it with the four sweet foods, sprinkled over the top ghee of the colour 
of a lotus calyx. Handing it back to the Pacceka Buddha, she prayed to herself 
“May I have a shining body like this offering.”</p>
<p>In a later birth, Bhaddā was born as the daughter of a 
wealthy treasurer of Benares; she was given in marriage, but her body was of 
such evil odour that she was repulsive to all and was abandoned by several 
husbands. Much troubled, she had her ornaments made into an ingot of gold and 
placed it on the shrine of Kassapa Buddha, which was in process of being built, 
and did reverence to it with her hands full of lotuses. Her body immediately 
became fragrant and sweet, and she was married again to her first husband. The 
Apadāna account mentions two other lives: one when she was the wife of Sumitta 
and gave a blanket to a Pacceka Buddha, and again when she was born among the 
Koliyans and attended on one hundred Pacceka Buddhas of Koliya. </p>
<p>Later, she was the queen of <a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda</a>, king of Benares 
(Brahmadatta, according to the Apadāna, which gives King Nanda as the name of 
her husband in another life), with whom she ministered to five hundred Pacceka 
Buddhas, sons of <a href="padumavati.htm" title="pa/padumavati.htm">Padumavatī</a>. When they passed away she was greatly troubled and 
left the world to give herself up to ascetic practices. She dwelt in a grove, 
developed jhāna, and was reborn in the Brahma world. (ThigA.67ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.; 
AA.ii.93ff., 203f.; A.i.25; Thig.vs.63-6).</p>
<p>Bhaddā Kāpilānī’s name is mentioned several times (e.g., 
Vin.iv.227, 268, 269, etc.) in the Vinaya rules in connection with her pupils 
who were found guilty of transgressing them. She and 
<a href="thulla_nandaa.htm" title="t/thulla_nandaa.htm">Thullanandā</a> were both 
famous as preachers, and the latter, being jealous of Bhaddā, went out of her 
way to insult her (Vin.iv.290). Once Bhaddā sent word to Sāketa asking 
Thullanandā if she could find her a lodging in <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. Nandā agreed to do 
this, but made things very unpleasant for Bhaddā when she arrived. (Vin.iv.292)
</p>
<p>Bhaddā Kāpilānī is identified with the brahmin woman in 
the <a href="hatthipala_jat_509.htm" title="h/hatthipala_jat_509.htm">Hatthipāla Jātaka</a> (J.iv.491) and with Sāma’s mother in the 
<a href="sama_jat_540.htm" title="sa/sama_jat_540.htm">Sāma Jātaka</a> 
(J.vi.95).</p>
