</ul>
<p>Father of Dhammasava. </p>
<p>He was one hundred and twenty years old 
when his son joined the Order and, being impressed by his son’s renunciation 
while yet young, he followed his example and soon after became an arahant.
</p>
<p>Once, in the past, he saw a Pacceka 
Buddha on the Bhūtagana mountain, and honoured him with tinasūla-flowers. 
</p>
<p>Eleven kappas ago he was a king called 
Dharanīpati (Dharaniruha) (Thag.108; ThagA.i.215f). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Tinasūlaka 
of the Apadāna. Ap.i.179.</p>
