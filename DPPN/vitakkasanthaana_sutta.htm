  <h2>Vitakkasanth훮na Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The twentieth sutta of the Majjhima Nik훮ya, preached to 
the monks at S훮vatthi. A monk can, in five ways, get rid of bad thoughts 
associated with lust, hatred, and delusion: by diverting his mind elsewhere; by 
scrutiny of their perilous consequence; by ignoring bad and wrong thoughts; by 
allaying what moulds these thoughts; by subduing them by sheer force of mind. 
These different methods are illustrated by similes. M.i.118 122.</p>
