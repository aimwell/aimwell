<p>Cundī.-A princess. She visited the 
Buddha at the Kalandakanivāpa in Veluvana, and he preached to her the Cundī 
Sutta (A.iii.35f). According to the Commentary (AA.ii.596), she was the daughter 
of Bimbisāra. The king gave her five hundred chariots for the use of herself and 
her companions. She was one of the three women who received this gift from their 
fathers, the others being Visākhā and the princess Sumanā. Cundī’s brother was 
Cunda. Her name occurs in a list of eminent upāsikās. A.iv.347.</p>
<p>Cundī Sutta.-Cundī visits the Buddha and 
tells him that, according to her brother, Cunda, those who take refuge in the 
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Order and refrain from the taking of life, from 
theft, carnal lusts, lying and liquor, will be born in a happy condition after 
death. She wishes to know more of this. The Buddha explains to her that the 
Tathāgata is the best of beings, the Doctrine which leads to Nibbāna is the best 
of teachings, the Tathāgata’s Order is the best field of merit, and of virtues, 
those beloved by Ariyans are the best. A.iii.35f.</p>
