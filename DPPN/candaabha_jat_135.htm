  <h2>Candābha Jātaka (No.135)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic and, 
at the moment of his death, answered his disciples' inquiries with the words 
“moonlight and sunlight.” When his chief pupil (identified with Sāriputta) 
interpreted the words, his colleagues did not believe him until the Bodhisatta 
appeared in mid-air and said that whoever meditated on the sun and the moon 
would be born in the Ābhassara world (J.i.474).</p>
<p>The Jātaka was preached about the 
interpretation of a problem by Sāriputta at the gates of Sankassa.</p>
