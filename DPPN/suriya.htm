<p><b>1. Suriya. </b>A Devaputta. Once, when he was seized by 
Rāhu, lord of the Asuras, he invoked the power of the Buddha, and the Buddha 
enjoined on Rāhu to let him go. This Rāhu did, and Suriya is spoken of as 
seeking Vepacitti and standing by his side, trembling and with stiffened hair 
(S.i.51; cf. Candimā). Suriya is one of the inhabitants of the Cātummahārājika-world 
(MNidA.108). Suriya and Candimā are both under the rule of Sakka, and we find 
Sakka asking them to stop their journeying at his behest. (E.g., when he wished 
the Sāmaneras Pandita and Sukha to be able to meditate undisturbed (DhA.ii.143; 
iii.97). See also DhA.iii.208). </p>
<p>Suriya was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya 
Sutta (D.ii.260). He is sometimes (PSA. 253) described as Adicca (Aditi’s son). 
The disk of the sun, which forms Suriya’s vimāna, is fifty leagues in diameter 
(E.g., D.iii.196).</p>
