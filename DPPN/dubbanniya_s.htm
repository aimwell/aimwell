<p>Once an ill-favoured yakkha came to be 
seated on Sakka’s throne. The gods of Tāvatimsa were greatly vexed on seeing 
him, but the greater their annoyance, the handsomer grew the yakkha. Then Sakka 
came up and showed great humility before the yakkha, and the greater his 
humility the uglier did the yakkha become, until he disappeared. S.i.237.</p>
