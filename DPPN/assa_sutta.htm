  <h2>Assa Sutta</h2>

<p>Once Assa, the “Jockey” (assāroha) of 
Rājagaha came to the Buddha to ask if it were true that a horse-trainer, if he 
exerted himself in the performance of his duties, would be born among the 
Sarañjita devas? The Buddha tells him that such a view is a perverted one and 
that its result is rebirth either in purgatory or as an animal. Assa expresses 
his consternation and declares himself thenceforth a follower of the Buddha. 
S.iv.310.</p>
