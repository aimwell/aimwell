</ul>
<p>A labourer who, in return for three years' work, obtained 
the privilege of enjoying the luxuries of the Treasurer Gandha (q.v.). When he 
was ready to eat, however, a Pacceka Buddha appeared and Bhattabhatika gave him 
all his food. When Gandha discovered this, he made over to Bhattabhatika one 
half of all his possessions, and they became firm friends. The king made 
Bhattabhatika a Treasurer. </p>
<p>After death he was born in the deva worlds, whence he was 
reborn in Sāvatthi as Sukhakumāra. DhA.iii.87ff.; for the rest of the story see 
Sukha.</p>
