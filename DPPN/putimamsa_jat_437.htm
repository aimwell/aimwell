<h2>Pūtimamsa Jātaka (No. 437)</h2>

<p>Once, on the slopes of the Himālaya, lived a jackal called 
Pūtimamsa with his mate Venī. Near by dwelt a flock of wild goats. Pūtimamsa 
formed a device for killing the goats one by one and eating their flesh, till 
only a she goat, called Melamātā, was left. Wishing to devour her as well, 
Pūtimamsa suggested to Venī that he should pretend to be dead and that Venī 
should then entice Melamātā into the cave by asking her to assist in the funeral 
rites. But the goat was wise and observant and discovered the ruse. Venī went to 
her later and saying that Pūtimamsa had recovered consciousness at the very 
sight of her, invited her to join them in a feast to celebrate his recovery. 
Melamātā, agreed, saying that she would bring with her a large escort of her 
friends, fierce dogs, including Maliya, Pingiya, Caturakkha and Jambuka, in 
order that the celebration might be a great one. At this suggestion Pūtimamsa 
and Venī fled from their cave, taking rescue elsewhere.</p>
<p>The story was told to the monks in order to impress on 
them the necessity for keeping guard over their senses. J.iii.532ff.</p>
