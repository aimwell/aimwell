<p><b>1. Val훮haka Sutta. </b>There are four kinds of rain 
clouds: those which produce thunder but no rain; those which produce rain but, 
no thunder; those which produce neither; those which produce both. There are 
four similar kinds of persons: those that speak but do not act; those that act 
but do not speak; those that do neither; and those that do both. A.ii.102.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Val훮haka Sutta. </b>There are four kinds of 
rain-clouds (as above) and four kinds of people: those that know the Dhamma but 
do not understand it; those that do not know it but understand it; those that do 
neither; those that do both. A.ii.103.</p>
