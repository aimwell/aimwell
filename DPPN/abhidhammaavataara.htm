<p>An Abhidhamma treatise by 
<a href="buddhadatta.htm" title="b/buddhadatta.htm">Buddhadatta</a> of 
<a href="uragapura.htm" title="u/uragapura.htm">Uragapura</a>. The book was written in India in the Cola country. It is an 
introduction to the study of the Abhidhamma, and there is much similarity 
between it and the <a href="visuddhi_magga.htm" title="vy/visuddhi_magga.htm">Visuddhi Magga</a>, though Buddhadatta’s diction is less involved 
and ambiguous than that of <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a>; his vocabulary is extraordinarily rich 
and his style more graphic.</p>
<p>The work is mostly in verse with, here 
and there, a prose commentary supplied by the author himself (Gv.69; see P.L.C. 
107-8 for details).</p>
<p>Two tīkās on it exist, one by 
<a href="vaacissara.htm" title="va/vaacissara.htm">Vācissara</a> 
Mahāsāmi of the <a href="mahavihara.htm" title="maha/mahavihara.htm">Mahāvihara</a> and the other by 
<a href="sumangala.htm" title="s/sumangala.htm">Sumangala</a>, pupil of 
<a href="saariputta.htm#2" title="sa/saariputta.htm#2">Sāriputta</a>. 
Sās.34.</p>
<p>Gv. (p.69) says that Buddhadatta wrote 
it at the request of his pupil Sumati.</p>
