</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Tissa.</b>-The seventeenth of the 
twenty-four Buddhas. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>He was born in the Anomā pleasaunce in 
  Khemaka. </li>
  <li>
  <p>His father was Janasandha (v.l. 
  Saccasandha) and his mother Padumā. </li>
  <li>
  <p>He lived the household life for seven 
  thousand years, in three palaces — Guhāsala, Nārī (Nārisa) and Nisabha&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>He left the world on a horse named 
  Sonuttara. </li>
  <li>
  <p>For eight months he practised 
  austerities. </li>
  <li>
  <p>After a meal of milk rice given by the 
  daughter of Vīrasetthi of Vīragāma, </li>
  <li>
  <p>he sat on grass given by a yavapālaka 
  named Vijitasangāma </li>
  <li>
  <p>He attained Buddhahood under an asana 
  tree. </li>
  <li>
  <p>He preached his first sermon at 
  Yasavatī to Brahmadeva and Udaya (Udayana) of Hamsavatī, who later became his 
  chief disciples. </li>
  <li>
  <p>His attendant was Samanga (Sambhava)
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>His chief patrons being Sambala and 
  Siri among men and Kisāgotamī and Upasenā among women. </li>
  <li>
  <p>His chief women disciples were Phussā 
  and Sudattā. </li>
  <li>
  <p>His body was sixty cubits high&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>After a life of one hundred thousand 
  years he died at Nandārāma (Sunandārāma) in Sunandavatī. </li>
  <li>
  <p>His body was cremated and a thūpa was 
  erected three leagues in height. Bu.xviii.1ff; BuA.188ff; J.i.40.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Tissa.</b>-The ninth future Buddha. See Anāgasavamsa, p.40.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Tissa.</b>-One of the two chief disciples 
of Vipassī Buddha (Bu.xx.28; J.i.41; D.ii.4). He was the son of the purohita 
Bandhumatī, and the Buddha’s first sermon was preached to him and Khanda. 
BuA.196.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Tissa.</b>-One of the two chief disciples 
of Dīpankara Buddha. Bu.ii.213; J.i.29; Mbv.5.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Tissa</b>.-An aggasāvaka of Kassapa 
Buddha. He was the Buddha’s brother and, having renounced the household, became 
an ascetic. On hearing that Kassapa had become Buddha, he visited him but 
expressed great disappointment on discovering that he ate flesh food (āmagandha). 
The Buddha taught him that āmagandha was not really flesh but the kilesas which 
corrupt the heart, and he preached to him the Āmagandha Sutta. Tissa immediately 
entered the Order and became an aggasāvaka (Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.280-2, 293; 
D.ii.4). Tissa’s father was born as Subhadda in this age. Ap.i.101.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Tissa.</b>-A monk who was reborn as a 
Brahmā with great iddhi-powers. Moggallāna visited him soon after his birth in 
the Brahma-world and asked him questions about devas and Brahmas who were 
assured of salvation (A.iii.331; iv.75ff). He was evidently the Tissa mentioned 
as being present at the Mahāsamaya. D.ii.261; DA.ii.692.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Tissa.</b>-A friend of Metteyya. They 
together visited the Buddha at Jetavana and, having listened to his teaching, 
entered the Order. Metteyya retired with his teacher into the forest and not 
long after became an arahant. Tissa lived in Sāvatthi and when his elder brother 
died, he went home and was persuaded by his relations to return to the lay life. 
Later, Metteyya, passing through the village with the Buddha, during a journey, 
visited Tissa and brought him once more to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to 
them the Tissa-Metteyya Sutta, at the end of which Tissa became a Sotāpanna, 
later attaining arahantship. SN., p.160f; SNA.ii.535f, NidA.184.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Tissa.</b>-The personal name of Metteyya, 
friend of Tissa (7). Metteyya was his gotta-name by which he became known 
(SNA.ii.536; NidA.184). In the Sutta Nipāta (vs.814) he is called Tissa-Metteyya.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Tissa-Metteyya.</b>-A disciple of Bāvarī. 
He visited the Buddha with his colleagues and when the Buddha answered his 
questions, he, and his thousand pupils became arahants. Tissa was his personal 
name and Metteyya that of his clan. SN., vs.1040-2; SNA.ii.588.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Tissa.</b>-An Elder of Sāvatthi. He once 
received a length of coarse cloth as a gift and handed it to his sister to be 
made into a robe. She had the cloth pounded and spun into fine yarn and made of 
it a soft robe-cloth. At first Tissa would not accept it but was prevailed upon 
to do so and had it made into a soft robe by skilled robe-makers. He died on the 
night it was finished and, as a result of his fancy for it, was reborn as a 
louse in the robe. After his death, the monks wished to divide the robe but the 
louse started shouting. The Buddha, hearing this by his power of divine 
audience, asked the monks to lay the robe aside for seven days. At the end of 
that period, the louse was reborn in the Tusita world. DhA.iii.341ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Tissa.</b>-A monk. When the Buddha 
declared that in four months he would pass away, many monks were greatly 
excited, collecting in groups, not knowing what to do. But Tissa remained aloof, 
determined to win arahantship before the Buddha’s death. The others, 
misunderstanding him, reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no love for him, but 
the Buddha, having questioned him, praised his earnestness. DhA.iii.267f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Tissa Thera.</b>-An arahant. He belonged 
to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and, having attained great proficiency in the 
Vedas, became a teacher of five hundred young men. When the Buddha visited 
Rājagaha, Tissa was so struck by his majesty that he joined the Order, later 
winning arahantship. The Theragāthā contains verses uttered by him regarding 
certain monks who were jealous of his great renown.</p>
<p>In the time of Piyadassī Buddha, Tissa 
was an ascetic. Seeing the Buddha in samādhi in a forest-grove, he built over 
him an arbour of silo flowers and for seven days paid him homage. 
(Thag.vv.153-4; ThagA.i.272f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with 
Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna (ii.431f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Tissa.</b>-A rājā of <a href="roruka.htm" title="r/roruka.htm">Roruva</a>. He was an 
“unseen” ally of <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> and, as such, sent him various gifts. The king sent 
him in return a painted panel on which was depicted the life of the Buddha and a 
gold plate specially inscribed with the Paticcasamuppāda. On seeing these, Tissa’s mind was filled with agitation and, giving up his title, he came to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> as a monk and lived in the
<a href="sappasondika.htm" title="sa/sappasondika.htm">Sappasondika</a> cave, from there visiting the 
Buddha, and soon afterwards becoming an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a 
chariot-maker and gave the Buddha a stool made of sandalwood. Fifty-seven kappas 
ago he was four times king under the name of Santa (Bhavanimmita) (Thag.97; 
ThagA.i.199f). He is probably identical with Phalakadāyaka of the Apadāna 
(i.174).</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="14">14</a>. Tissa Thera.</b>-An arahant. Son of the 
Buddha’s paternal aunt, Amitā. He entered the Order and dwelt in a woodland 
settlement, but he was proud of his rank and irritable and captious in his 
conduct. He once came to the Buddha in tears because his colleagues had teased 
him on account of his talkativeness (S.ii.282; MA.i.289). On another occasion, 
the Buddha, with his celestial eye, saw Tissa sleeping with open mouth during 
the siesta and, sending a ray of glory, woke him. Tissa’s heart was filled with 
anguish and when he confessed to his colleagues his mental laziness and distaste 
for religion, they brought him to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him the 
Tissa Sutta, at the end of which he became an arahant (Thag.v.39; but see 
v.1162; S.iii.106f; ThagA.i.105).</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he swept the 
leaves from the foot of the Bodhi-tree. He is evidently identical with 
Bodhisammajjaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.457f).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.31ff) calls 
him Thullatissa. He entered the Order when old and became fat through idleness. 
He spent most of his time in the Waiting-hall draped in rich robes. Monks, 
taking him for a Mahā Thera, begged the privilege of performing various services 
for him, such as massaging his feet. But when they discovered his attainments, 
they reviled him and he sought the Buddha. The Buddha, however, asked him to 
obtain their pardon for having failed to show them due honour, and when he 
refused, related to him the story of Nārada and Devala.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>15. Tissa.</b>-A novice. He was a 
gatekeeper’s son and, coming with some carpenters to Sāvatthi, joined the Order. 
He was constantly finding fault with the food and other offerings, even those 
given by Anāthapindika, and he boasted of the riches enjoyed by his kinsfolk. 
His colleagues made enquiries and, discovering the truth about his antecedents, 
reported him to the Buddha who preached the Katāhaka Jātaka (q.v.) to show his 
similar tendencies in the past (DhA.iii.367). Tissa was identified with Katāhaka 
of the Jātaka. J.i.455.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>16. Tissa.</b>-A monk. He was called Kosambivāsī Tissa. He spent the rainy season at Kosambī and, on his departure, 
his supporter gave him three robes and other offerings; he, however, refused 
them saying that he had no novice to look after them. The layman immediately 
gave his son, then seven years old, to be his novice. The boy attained 
arahantship in the Tonsure-hall. While on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha, 
Tissa accidentally blinded the novice by hitting his eye with a fan at dawn. The 
Elder was filled with remorse and, falling at the boy’s feet, asked his pardon. 
But the answer was that there was no fault to pardon, the accident was due to 
samsāra. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the 
nature of arahants. They felt no resentment. At the end of the discourse, Tissa 
became an arahant (DhA.ii.182ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>17. Tissa.</b>-A monk, called Asubhakammika-Tissa. 
He is mentioned in the Commentaries (VibhA.270) as an example of a good friend, 
devoted to the contemplation of asubha, association with whom helps one to get 
rid of lust. His teacher was Mahātissa of Kotapabbata-vihāra. MT.553.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>18. Tissa.</b>-A master of writing (lekhācariya). 
Even after his death he was known by reason of his writing. Mil., p.70; see 
J.R.A.S.xii.159.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>19. Tissa.</b>-One of the chief lay patrons 
of Padumuttara Buddha. Bu.xi.26.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>20. Tissa.</b>-A monk known as Āraddhavipassaka-Tissa. While walking about he saw a lotus open at the rising of 
the sun. Immediately afterwards, he heard a slave-girl singing; her song told of 
how men are subject to death just as the lotus opens to the sun. Tissa thereupon 
developed insight and became an arahant. SNA.ii.397.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>21. Tissa.</b>-Uncle of Pandukābhaya. He 
administered the kingdom when his elder brother, Abhaya, gave up the government. 
He was killed by Pandukābhaya. Mhv.x.51, 70.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>22. Tissa-<a name="Kontiputta">Kontiputta</a>.</b>-An Elder of Asoka’s time, a 
disciple of Mahāvaruna and brother of Sumitta. He was the son of a kinnarī 
called Kuntī. He died of a bite by a venomous 
insect. Asoka was grieved on learning that Tissa’s death was due to his failure 
to obtain ghee in his illness. Mhv.v.213ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>23. Tissa-kumāra.</b>-Brother of Asoka and 
his vice-regent. He once asked Asoka why monks were not joyful and gay and 
Asoka, in order to teach him the reason, gave him the throne for a week, saying 
that at the end of the week he would be put to death. Tissa then realised that 
monks, who had the constant consciousness of death, could not be merry.</p>
<p>He later became a monk under Yonaka 
Mahādhammarakkhita and lived in the Asokārāma, where he prevented the murder of 
the theras by the minister sent by Asoka to make the monks hold the uposatha 
together. He became an arahant and, on account of his love of solitude, came to 
be known as Ekavihāriya. Thag.vv.537-46; ThagA.i.503f; Mhv.v.33, 60, 154ff, 241; 
SA.iii.125.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>24. Tissa.</b>-King of Kalyāni and father of 
Vihāramahādevī (Mhv.xxii.13ff). His brother Ayya-Uttika entered into an intrigue 
with the queen and was banished. He sent the queen a letter through an attendant 
to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace. This letter fell into 
the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself, owing to a similarity 
in his writing to that of the intriguer. The king ordered the arahant to be 
killed and cast into the sea. The devas, being offended, caused the sea to 
overflow the land. The total destruction of the country was only averted by the 
king sending his daughter Devī (afterwards Vihāramahadevī), to sea in a golden 
boat. The Rasavāhini, however, says he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling 
oil; see Telakatāhagāthā.</p>
<p>Tissa’s father was Mutasiva and his 
grandfather Uttiya. MT.431.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>25. Tissa.</b>-A minister of Dutthagāmani. 
When the latter fled from Saddhātissa, Tissa joined him and he gave him his own 
food during the flight. But the food was ultimately given to a monk (see Tissa 
26) who accepted their invitation to the meal. (For details see Mhv.xxiv.22ff; 
AA.i.365). It was probably the mother of this Tissa who, we are told (Vsm., 
p.63), used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son’s 
birth, which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the Tālaveli road hoping that 
it might prove useful to a pāmsukūlika monk.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>26. Tissa.</b>-A thera in Piyangudīpa. He it 
was who accepted the meal given by Dutthagāmani while fleeing from his brother. 
Mhv.xxiv.25.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>27. Tissa.</b>-A brahmin youth of Rohana who 
rebelled against Vattagāmani in the fifth year of his reign. At that time 
Damilas invaded Ceylon and Vattagāmani sent word to Tissa asking him to fight 
them, and take the throne for himself; Tissa did, but was conquered by them 
(Mhv.xxxiii.38ff). See also Brāhmana-Tissa.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>28. Tissa</b>.-A monk of Kambugallaka; he 
was very learned and helped to reconcile Vattagāmani and his discontented 
ministers (Mhv.xxxiii.71, 75). Later, the ministers built several vihāras — the 
Mūlavokāsa, the Sāliyārāma, the Pabbatārāma and the Uttaratissārāma — and handed 
them over to Tissa. Ibid., 91.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>29. Tissa.</b>-A minister of Vattagāmani; he 
built the Uttamtissārāma. Mhv.xxxiii.91.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>30. Tissa.</b>-Son of Mahācūla and king of 
Ceylon (9-12 A.D.). He was poisoned by his wife Anulā. Mhv.xxxiv.15ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>31. Tissa.</b>-A paramour of Queen Anulā. He 
was a wood-carrier and was therefore called Dārubhatika-Tissa. He reigned for 
one year and one month and built a bathing-tank in the Mahāmeghavana. He was 
poisoned by Anulā. Mhv.xxxiv.22ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>32. Tissa.</b>-A monk of the Dakkhinārāma, 
for whom Mahāsena built the Jetavana-vihāra. Mhv.xxxvii.32, 38.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>33. Tissa.</b>-Younger son of Mahādāthika-Mahānāga and brother of Ānanda gāmani Abhaya. He was known as 
<b><a href="kanirajaanu_tissa.htm" title="ka/kanirajaanu_tissa.htm">Kanirajānu-tissa</a></b>. Mhv.xxxv.11ff; MT.640.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>34. Tissa</b>.-Nephew of Khallātanāga and 
son of Sumanadevī, step-sister to the king. With his brothers, Abhaya and Uttara, 
he conspired to kill the king. But the conspiracy failed and they committed 
suicide. MT.612.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>35. Tissa.</b>-An artisan (kammāraputta), a 
previous incarnation of Sāliya. He lived in Mundagangā and receiving one day as 
wages the flesh of a boar, he had it cooked by his wife. When the meal was ready 
he announced alms; the theras Dhammadinna, Godhiya-Mahātissa, Mahānāga of 
Samuddavihāra, Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, Mahāsangharakkhita, Dhammagutta, 
Mahānāga of Bhātiyavanka and Maliyamahādeva appeared to accept the alms. 
MT.605f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>36. Tissa.</b>-A monk resident in Lonagiri (Lenagiri). 
He once saw fifty monks, on their way to Nāgadipa on a pilgrimage, returning 
from their alms-rounds in Mahākhīragāma, with their bowls empty. Asking them to 
wait, he returned in a little while with his bowl of milk rice which proved more 
than enough for the whole company. Seeing their astonishment, he explained that 
since he had begun to practise the sārānīya-dhammā, his bowl had never lacked 
food.</p>
<p>At the Giribhandamahāpūjā at 
Cetiyapabbata, Tissa wished to have for himself two shawls, the most precious 
things there. He declared his wish in the presence of others and the king, on 
being informed, determined that Tissa should not have them, but every time he 
put out his hand to take the robes, they slipped away, and others took their 
place. In the end the robes were given to Tissa (DA.ii.534f; MA.i.545).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>37. Tissa</b>.-A Thera of Sāvatthi, better 
known as Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa. He renounced forty crores of wealth and became a 
monk dwelling in the forest. His younger brother’s wife sent five hundred 
ruffians to kill him. He begged them to spare his life for one night and broke 
his thigh-bone with a stone as token that he would not attempt to escape. During 
the night he overcame his pain and, dwelling on his virtues, became an arahant 
(MA.i.188f; DA.iii.747; Vsm.48).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>38. Tissa.</b>-A Thera of Sāketa. He refused 
to answer questions, saying that he had no time. On being asked, “Can you find 
time to die?” he felt ashamed, and going to the Kanikāravālikasamudda-vihāra, 
instructed monks of varying grades during the rainy season, rousing great 
enthusiasm among the populace by his preaching (MA.i.350f; DA.iii.1061).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>39. Tissa.</b>-A monk of <a href="kotapabbata.htm" title="ku/kotapabbata.htm">Kotapabbata</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>40. Tissa.</b>-A minister. The scholiast to 
the <a href="kanha_jat_29_440.htm" title="ka/kanha_jat_29_440.htm">Kanha Jātaka</a> mentions a story of an amacca called Tissa who, in a rage, 
killed his wife and all his retinue and, finally, himself. J.iv.11.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>41. Tissa.</b>-A novice of Pañcaggalalena. 
While travelling through the air he heard the daughter of the artisan of 
Girigāma singing, after having bathed with her companions in a lotus-pond. Being 
attracted by the sound, he lost his power of travelling through the air. 
MA.i.353; SNA.i.70.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>42. Tissa.</b>-A novice of Tissamahā-vihāra. 
He complained to his teacher of his distaste for the Order and the latter took 
him to Cittalapabbata. There, with great effort, Tissa built for himself a cave 
and while lying there during the night, became an arahant, dying the next day. A 
thūpa called the Tissa-thera-cetiya was erected over his relics and this was 
still in existence in Buddhaghosa’s day (MA.i.312f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>43. Tissa.</b>-An attendant of King Saddhā-Tissa. 
The king, wishing to eat pheasants, asked Tissa to procure some, having first 
tested him by threatening to have him executed if he refused to kill fowl for 
the king’s table. Tissa, even when led to the executioner’s block, refused to 
kill the birds. The king was thus satisfied that Tissa would not kill pheasants 
for him. The next day, Tissa, seeing a fowler hawking some dead pheasants, 
obtained them for the king (SA.iii.49ff; AA.i.262).</p>
