</ul>
<p>Māra approaches the Buddha under the Ajapālanigrodha in 
Uruvelā, and engages him in conversation. He asks the Buddha to go about among 
men and make friends and be happy, satisfied with having discovered the path of 
immortality for himself without feeling it necessary to teach others. But the 
Buddha refuses his request, and Māra confesses that he has no longer any power 
over him; he is like a crab whose claws have been broken one by one. The sutta 
adds that Māra had been awaiting an opportunity to find a flaw in the Buddha for 
seven years. The Commentary adds six before the Enlightenment and one after. He 
retires discomfited and sits not far away from the Buddha, brooding, scratching 
the earth with a stick. S.i.122ff.</p>
