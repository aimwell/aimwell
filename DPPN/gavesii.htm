</ul>
<p>A follower of Kassapa Buddha. Five 
hundred others were associated with him, and at first their spiritual life was 
poor. Gavesī, realising this, put forth effort and, step by step, attained 
greater proficiency until, at last, he became an arahant. His followers imitated 
him in every step of his spiritual advancement, and they, too, became arahants.</p>
<p>The Buddha related this story to Ānanda 
during a tour in Kosala. They came to a sāla-grove and there the Buddha smiled; 
when asked the reason for his smile, he replied that the grove was the scene of 
Gavesī’s practice of the religious life. A.iii.214ff.</p>
