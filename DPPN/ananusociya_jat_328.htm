  <h2>Ananusociya Jātaka (No. 328)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was born as a rich 
Brahmin in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. After his education at Takkasilā his parents wished him to 
marry. After much persuasion he agreed to do so, if they could find a woman like 
a golden image which he would make. Emissaries were sent out and they found a 
girl of sixteen, Samīllabhāsinī, in the Kāsi kingdom. She did not wish to marry 
either, but yielded to her parent’s wishes. Though the two young people were 
married they lived in celibacy and when their parents died they gave away their 
immense wealth and became ascetics. Samillabhāsini died of dysentery caused by 
unsatisfactory meals. The Bodhisatta coming back from his begging-rounds found 
her dead on a bench, but proceeded to eat his meal much to the surprise of the 
onlookers. On being questioned, “Why should I weep?” he said “that which has the 
quality of dissolution is dissolved.”</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
landowner who, when his wife died, gave himself up to despair. The Buddha, 
seeing his upanissaya, went out to meet him and told him the story, whereupon he 
obtained the First Fruit of the Path. J.iii.92-7.</p>
