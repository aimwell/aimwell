<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a teacher in 
Takkasilā, and the heir to the throne of Benares was his student. Foreseeing 
danger to the prince from his son, he taught the prince four stanzas to be 
repeated when his son should be sixteen years old, at the evening meal, at the 
time of the great levee, while ascending the palace roof, and in the royal 
chamber respectively. The prince in due course became king, and, as had been 
foreseen by his teacher, he was conspired against by his son, but saved his life 
by repeating the stanzas. The son was cast into prison, and set free only after 
the king’s death.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Bimbisāra’s great love for Ajātasattu, though soothsayers had predicted that the 
latter would kill his father (J.iii.121ff).</p>
