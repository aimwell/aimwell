<p>1. Uttara Sutta.-The conversation 
between Uttara devaputta (Uttara 3) and the Buddha. One’s life is short, says 
the devaputta; one should, therefore, gather merit, in order to gain bliss. 
Rather, answers the Buddha, reject the bait of all the worlds and aspire after 
final Peace (S.i.54).</p>
<p>2. Uttara Sutta.-Preached to the monks 
by Uttara Thera (Uttara 6) at Mount Sankheyya at Dhavajālikā in Mahisavatthu. 
From time to time we should reflect on our own misfortunes as well as on those 
of others, and likewise on our successes. Vessavana heard this sutta being 
preached as he was journeying from north to south on some business. He went to 
Tāvatimsa, where he informed Sakka of what he had heard Uttara say. Sakka, 
thereupon, appeared before Uttara and asked him whether his sermon was based on 
his own illumination (patibhāna), or on what he had heard from the Buddha. 
Uttara’s reply was that his words were garnered from the Doctrine of the Buddha 
just as a man takes a handful of grain from a heap of grain. Sakka then repeated 
the whole sermon on the same subject, which be had heard the Buddha preach to 
the monks at Gijjhakūta in Rājagaha. A.iv.162-6.</p>
