<p>The twenty-third in the list of the 
twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa. He was 
born in the Subhagavatī Park in Sobhavatī, the capital of King Sobha, his father 
being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttarā. He lived in the household 
for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his 
chief wife was Rucigattā and their son was Satthavāha. Konāgamana left the world 
on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of 
which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and 
grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka. His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree. 
His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot 
of a Mahā-sāla tree. He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered 
thirty thousand. His body was thirty cubits in height. He died in the 
Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand. His relics were scattered. His chief 
disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, 
his constant attendant being Sotthiya. His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva 
among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya 
named Pabbata of Mithilā. He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and 
joined the Order. (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka 
his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190). </p>
<p>The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a 
Sanghārāma half a league in extent (J.i.94).</p>
<p>On the day of the Buddha’s birth a 
shower of gold fell all over Jambudīpa, hence he was called Kanakāgamana, 
Konāgamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)</p>
<p>According to the Ceylon Chronicles 
(Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konāgamana visited 
their Island (then known as Varadīpa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted 
the Mahānoma garden at Vaddhamāna, given by King Samiddha, and preached the 
doctrine. At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the 
Truth. At the Buddha’s wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l. Kanakadattā) brought to 
Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree. The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, 
the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people’s 
worship. He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.</p>
<p>In Konāgamana’s time Mount Vepulla was 
known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, 
their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191). Konāgamana held the 
uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).</p>
<p>In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; 
Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konāgamana is called 
Kanakamuni, Konākamuni, and Kanakaparvata. A Thūpa, erected on the spot where 
Konāgamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who 
rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: 
Inscrip. of Asoka, p.165). Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., ii.19) says he saw 
thūpas at Konāgamana’s birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father 
after the Enlightenment. Fa Hien (Travels, p.36) saw thūpas at the latter place 
and also at the place of the Buddha’s death.</p>
