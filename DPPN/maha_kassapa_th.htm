<blockquote>
  <h2>Mahā Kassapa Thera</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the Buddha’s most eminent disciples, chief among 
those who upheld minute observances of form (dhutavādānam) (A.i.23). He was born 
in the brahmin village of <a href="mahatittha.htm" title="maha/mahatittha.htm">Mahātittha</a> in 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, and was the son of the brahmin
<a href="kapila.htm" title="ka/kapila.htm">Kapila</a>, his mother being 
<a href="sumanadevi.htm" title="s/sumanadevi.htm">Sumanādevī</a>; he himself was called Pippali. At 
Ap.ii.583, vs. 56; but there his father is called Kosiyagotta.  </p>
<p>When he grew up 
he refused to marry in spite of the wishes of his parents; but in the end, to 
escape from their importunities, he agreed to marry if a wife could be found 
resembling a statue, which he had made. <a href="bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm" title="b/bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm">Bhaddā Kāpilānī</a> was found at Sāgala to fulfil these conditions, and though the young people wrote to each 
other suggesting that somebody else should be found as a match for each, their 
letters were intercepted and they were married. By mutual consent, however, the 
marriage was not consummated, the two spending the night separated by a chain of 
flowers. Pippali had immense wealth; he used twelve measures of perfumed powder 
daily, each measure a Magadhanāli, for his person alone. He had sixty lakes with 
water works attached, and his workmen occupied fourteen villages, each as large 
as <a href="anuraadhapura.htm" title="ay/anuraadhapura.htm">Anurādhapura</a>. </p>
<p>One day he went to a field, which was being ploughed and saw 
the birds eating the worms turned up by the plough. On being told that the sin 
therein was his, he decided to renounce all his possessions.  </p>
<p>At the same time, Bhaddā had been watching the crows eating the little insects, which ran about 
among the seamsum seeds that had been put out to dry, and when her attendant 
women told her that hers would be the sin for their loss of life, she also 
determined to renounce the world.</p>
<p>The husband and wife, finding that they were of one 
accord, took yellow raiments from their wardrobe, cut off each other’s hair, 
took bowls in their hands, and passed out through their weeping servants, to all 
of whom they granted their freedom, and departed together, Pippali walking in 
front. But soon they agreed that it was not seemly they should walk thus 
together, as each must prove a hindrance to the other. And so, at the cross 
roads, he took the right and she the left and the earth trembled to see such 
virtue.</p>
<p>The Buddha, sitting in the <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a> in 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a>, knew 
what the earthquake signified, and having walked three gāvutas (this journey of 
the Buddha is often referred to&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., MA.i.347, 357), sat down at 
the foot of the <a href="bahuputta.htm" title="b/bahuputta.htm">Bahuputtaka Nigrodha</a>, between 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and <a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>, resplendent 
in all the glory of a Buddha. Pippali (henceforth called Mahā Kassapa, no 
explanation is to be found anywhere as to why he is called Kassapa; it was 
probably his gotta name, but see Ap.ii.583, vs.56) saw the Buddha, and 
recognising him at once as his teacher, prostrated himself before him. The 
Buddha told him to be seated, and, in three homilies, gave him his ordination.</p>
<p>The three homilies are given at S.ii.220, “Thus Kassapa 
must thou train thyself: </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) 'There shall be a lively sense of fear and regard (hirotappa) 
  towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.' </li>
  <li>(2) 'Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what 
  is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, 
  pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.' </li>
  <li>(3) 'Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall 
  not be neglected by me.'“</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they returned to Rājagaha, Kassapa, who bore on 
his body seven of the thirty two marks of a Great Being, following the Buddha. 
On the way, the Buddha desired to sit at the foot of a tree by the roadside, and 
Kassapa folded for him his outer robe (pilotikasanghāti) as a seat. The Buddha 
sat on it and, feeling it with his hand, praised its softness. Kassapa asked him 
to accept it. “And what would you wear?” inquired the Buddha. Kassapa then 
begged that he might be given the rag robe worn by the Buddha. “It is faded with 
use,” said the Buddha, but Kassapa said he would prize it above the whole world 
and the robes were exchanged. (The robe which Kassapa exchanged with the Buddha 
was Punnā’s cloak. See <a href="punnaa.htm#6" title="pu/punnaa.htm#6">Punnā 6</a>).</p>
<p>This incident Kassapa always recalled with pride, 
e.g. S.ii.221. It is said that the Buddha paid him this great honour because he 
knew that Kassapa would hold a recital after his death, and thus help in the 
perpetuation of his religion, SA.ii.130. The earth quaked again in recognition 
of Kassapa’s virtues, for no ordinary being would have been fit to wear the 
Buddha’s cast off robe. Kassapa, conscious of the great honour, took upon 
himself the thirteen austere vows (dhutagunā) and, after eight days, became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the past Kassapa and Bhaddā had been husband and wife 
and companions in good works in many births. In the time of 
<a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha 
Kassapa was a very rich householder named Vedeha and married to Bhaddā, and very 
devoted to the Buddha. One day he heard the Buddha’s third disciple in rank (Nisabha) 
being awarded the place of pre eminence among those who observed austere 
practices, and registered a wish for a similar honour for himself in the future. 
He learnt from the Buddha of the qualities in which Nisabha excelled the Buddha 
himself, and determined to obtain them. With this end in view, during birth 
after birth, he expended all his energies in goods deeds. Ninety one kappas ago; 
in the time of <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a> Buddha, he was the brahmin
<a href="ekasaataka.htm" title="e/ekasaataka.htm">Ekasātaka</a> and Bhaddā 
was his wife. In the interval between <a href="konaagamana.htm" title="ku/konaagamana.htm">Konāgamana</a> and 
<a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddhas he was a setthiputta. He married Bhaddā, but because of an evil deed she had done in the 
past (see Bhaddā Kāpilānī), she became unattractive to him and he left her, 
taking her as wife again when she became attractive. Having seen from what had 
happened to his wife how great was the power of the Buddhas, the setthiputta 
wrapped Kassapa Buddha’s golden cetiya with costly robes and decked it with 
golden lotuses, each the size of a cartwheel.  </p>
<p>The Therī Apadāna (Ap.ii.582. vs. 
47-51) gives an account of two more of his lives, one 
as Sumitta and the other as Koliyaputta, in both of which he and his wife 
ministered to Pacceka Buddhas.</p>
<p>In the next birth he was <a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda</a>, king of Benares, 
and, because he had given robes in past lives, he had thirty two kapparukkhas, 
which provided him and all the people of his kingdom with garments. At the 
suggestion of his queen, he made preparations to feed holy men, and five hundred 
Pacceka Buddhas, sons of <a href="padumaa.htm" title="pa/padumaa.htm">Padumā</a>, came to accept his gift. In that life, too, 
Nanda and his queen renounced the world and became ascetics, and having 
developed the jhānas, were reborn in the Brahma world. </p>
<p>This account of Kassapa’s last life and his previous life 
is compiled from AA.i.92ff.; SA.ii.135ff.; ThagA.ii.134ff.; Ap.ii.578ff. 
Ap.i.33ff. gives other particulars — that he 
made offerings at Padumuttara’s funeral pyre and that he was once a king named 
Ubbiddha in the city of Rammaka; see also ApA.i.209f.</p>
<p>Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he 
was journeying from <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a> to 
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusināra</a> he met an 
<a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ājīvaka</a> carrying in his hand a 
mandārava flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven 
in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news. It was then 
the seventh day after the Buddha’s death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain 
to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it 
could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had 
saluted the Buddha’s feet. Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times 
round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha’s feet became 
visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was 
followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the 
feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself (D.ii.163f).  </p>
<p>It is said 
(Mhv.xxxi.20f.; see also Vsm.430) that the relics of the Buddha which fell to Ajātasattu’s share were taken to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> by Kassapa, in view of that which 
would happen in the future. At <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a> (on the announcement of the Buddha’s death), 
Kassapa had heard the words of <a href="subhadda.htm" title="s/subhadda.htm">Subhadda</a>, who, in his old age, had joined the 
Order, that they were “well rid of the great samana and could now do as they 
liked.” This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa’s mind the 
desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha’s teachings. He announced his 
intention to the assembled monks, and, as the senior among them and as having 
been considered by the Buddha himself to be fit for such a task, he was asked to 
make all necessary arrangements (e.g., DA.i.3). In accordance with his wishes, 
all the monks, other than the arahants chosen for the Recital, left Rājagaha 
during the rainy season. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under 
the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya (DA.i.3f.; 
5ff.; Sp.i.4.ff.; Mhv.iii.3ff). This recital is called the Therasangitī or 
<a href="theravaada.htm" title="t/theravaada.htm">Theravāda</a>.</p>
<p>The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
he is classed with <a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a>,
<a href="maha_kappina_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kappina_th.htm">Kappina</a>, and <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> for his great 
iddhi-powers. E.g., S.i.114; but his range of knowledge was limited; there were 
certain things which even Kassapa did not know (DhA.i.258). </p>
<p>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting 
the monks to lead the active and zealous lives (S.ii.205), and constantly held 
him up as an example to others in his great contentment (S.ii.194f) and his 
ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the 
moon (candopama), unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always 
taught others out of a feeling of compassion. S.ii.197ff. Kassapa’s freedom from 
any kind of attachment was, as the Buddha pointed out to the monks, due to the 
earnest wish he had made for that attainment in the past, “He has no attachment 
to requisites or households or monasteries or cells; but is like a royal swan 
which goes down into a lake and swims there, while the water does not adhere to 
his body” (DhA.ii.169f.).</p>
<p>The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power 
of attaining the jhānas and abiding therein (S.ii.210ff).</p>
<p>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and 
several instances are given of his exhortations to them (E.g., Thag.vss.1051-57, 
1072-81, and his long sermon at A.v.161ff ); but he 
was evidently sensitive to criticism, and would not address them unless he felt 
them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. E.g., S.ii.203ff.; and at 
219, when <a href="thulla_nandaa.htm" title="t/thulla_nandaa.htm">Thullanandā</a> finds fault with him for blaming 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>. See below. 
Kassapa had good reason for not wishing to address recalcitrant monks. The
<a href="kutiduusaka_jat_321.htm" title="ku/kutiduusaka_jat_321.htm">Kutidūsaka Jātaka</a> relates how one of his disciples,
<a href="ulunka_saddaka.htm" title="u/ulunka_saddaka.htm">Ulunka Saddaka</a>, angered by 
some admonition from Kassapa, burnt the latter’s grass hut while he was away on 
his alms round (J.iii.71f.). </p>
<p>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one 
occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ānanda, and accompanied by him he 
visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among 
them, for, at the end of his discourse, <a href="thulla_tissaa.htm" title="t/thulla_tissaa.htm">Thullatissā</a> openly reviled him for what 
she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, 
“as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.” (S.ii.215f) 
Kassapa loved Ānanda dearly, and was delighted when Ānanda attained arahantship 
in time to attend the First Recital, and when Ānanda appeared before the 
arahants, it was Kassapa who led the applause (DA.i.10f). But Kassapa was very 
jealous of the good name of the Order, and we find him (S.ii.218f) blaming 
Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its 
discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to 
the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a 
despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting 
away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” 
Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests&nbsp;&nbsp; “Surely my head is 
growing grey hairs, your reverence.” This incident, says the Commentary took 
place after the Buddha’s death, when Ānanda, as a new arahant and with all the 
honour of his intimacy with the Buddha, whose bowl and robe he now possessed, 
had become a notable personage. SA.ii.133; Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort 
of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even 
his name, lest it should imply disrespect (see Vin.i.92f.). </p>
<p>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her 
voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can 
chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to 
Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the 
Buddha for special honour.</p>
<p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among 
members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very 
lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining 
arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. 
S.ii.224f. At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given 
leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was 
opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and 
contempt from the laity (Vin.ii.287f.). </p>
<p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, 
dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always 
content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and 
energetic. See also the <a href="mahagosinga_s.htm" title="maha/mahagosinga_s.htm">Mahāgosinga Sutta</a> (M.i.214), where Kassapa declares his 
belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to 
others is proved by the case of <a href="somamitta_thera.htm" title="s/somamitta_thera.htm">Somamitta</a> who, finding his own teacher
<a href="vimala.htm" title="vy/vimala.htm">Vimala</a> given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his 
guidance. </p>
<p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was 
not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came 
after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the 
Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near 
him, he begged to be excused. S.ii.202f; but See <a href="jotidaasa.htm" title="j/jotidaasa.htm">Jotidāsa</a>, who is said to have 
built a vihāra for Kassapa, and entertained him. </p>
<p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at 
<a href="pipphaliguha.htm" title="pu/pipphaliguha.htm">Pipphaliguhā</a>, the 
Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised (S.v.78). </p>
<p>The knowledge that he had profited by the Master’s 
teaching, we are told (SA.iii.128), calmed his blood and purified his system, 
and the sickness fell away from him “like a drop of water from a lotus leaf.” He 
disdained being waited upon by anybody, even by a goddess such as 
<a href="laja.htm" title="l/laja.htm">Lājā</a> , 
lest he should set a bad example (DhA.iii.6ff).</p>
<p>Owing to his great saintliness, even the gods vied with 
each other to give alms to Kassapa. Once when he had risen from a trance lasting 
seven days, five hundred nymphs, wives of <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, appeared before him; but, 
snapping his fingers, he asked them to depart, saying that he bestowed his 
favours only on the poor. </p>
<p>The story of Kālavilangika is an example of Kassapa’s 
compassion for the poor. Once, after a seven days' trance, he went to the house 
of Kālavilanga and received alms from his wife, which he gave to the Buddha for 
their greater benefit. The Buddha took a portion of this and gave the rest to 
five hundred monks. Kālavilangika, received only a mouthful of the food left. 
The Buddha said that as a result he would be a setthi within seven days. 
Kālavilangika told this to his wife. It happened that a few days later the king 
saw a man impaled alive in the place of execution; the man begged him for some 
food, which he agreed to send. At night, when eating, the king remembered his 
promise, but could find no one bold enough to go to the cemetery. On the offer 
of one thousand pieces, Kālavilangika’s wife agreed to go in the guise of a man. 
On the way she was stopped by the yakkha <a href="diighataphala.htm" title="d/diighataphala.htm">Dīghataphala</a>, who, however, 
later released her and gave her treasure, as did also the yakkha’s father in 
law, the deva <a href="sumana.htm" title="s/sumana.htm">Sumana</a>. The man ate the food and, when wiping his mouth, 
recognised her as a woman and caught hold of her hair. But she cut off her hair, 
and proved to the satisfaction of the king that her mission had been 
accomplished. She then recovered the treasure given her by the yakkha and 
Sumana; when the king discovered her wealth, she and her husband were raised to 
the rank of setthi (MA.ii.812ff.).</p>
<p>When Sakka heard of this, he disguised himself as a weaver 
worn with age, and accompanied by <a href="sujaataa.htm" title="s/sujaataa.htm">Sujātā</a>, transformed into an old woman, 
appeared in a weaver’s hut along the lane where Kassapa was begging. The ruse 
succeeded and Kassapa accepted their alms; but, later, be discovered the truth 
and chided Sakka. Sakka begged forgiveness, and, on being assured that in spite 
of his deception the almsgiving would bring him merit, he flew into the air 
shouting, “Aho dānam, mahā danam, Kassapassa patitthitam.” The Buddha heard this 
and sympathised with Sakka in his great joy (DhA.i.423ff.; cp. Ud.iii.7). 
</p>
<p>But on one occasion so great was the importunity with 
which the monks of <a href="aalavii.htm" title="aa/aalavii.htm">Alavi</a> had wearied the people, that even Mahā Kassapa failed 
to get alms from them (J.ii.282). The Visuddhi Magga (403) relates a story of how 
once, when Kassapa was begging for alms in Rājagaha, in the company of the 
Buddha, on a festival day, five hundred maidens were going to the festival 
carrying cakes, “round like the moon.” They saw the Buddha but passed him by, 
and gave their cakes to Kassapa. The Elder made all the cakes fill just his 
single bowl and offered it to the Buddha (This is probably the incident referred 
to at Vsm.68).</p>
<p><a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and 
the <a href="kassapa_sam.htm" title="ka/kassapa_sam.htm">Kassapa Samyutta</a> contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity 
for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna (S.ii.195f), and the other on 
the existence of a <a href="tathaagata.htm" title="t/tathaagata.htm">Tathāgata</a> after death (S.ii.222f). This regard was mutual, 
for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced 
greatly and broke forth into song (Thag.vs.1082 5).</p>
<p>Kassapa lived to be very old, and, when he died, had not 
lain on a bed for one hundred and twenty years. DA.ii.413; AA.ii.596; he was one 
hundred and twenty at the time of the First Recital (SA.ii.130). According, to 
northern sources, Kassapa did not die; he dwells in the Kukkutagiri Mountains, 
wrapt in samādhi, awaiting the arrival of <a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteyya</a> Buddha (Beal, op. cit., 
ii.142f.). A tooth of Mahā Kassapa was enshrined in the 
<a href="bhimatittha_vih.htm" title="b/bhimatittha_vih.htm">Bhīmatittha vihāra</a> in 
Ceylon (Cv.lxxxv.81). </p>
