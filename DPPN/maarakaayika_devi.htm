  <h2>Mārakāyika devi</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A group of devas, evidently followers of Māra, who were 
credited by the Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas with making arahants discharge 
seminal fluid, though neither the arahants nor the devas themselves were guilty 
of physical impurity (Kvu. 164f.). One of these devas once entered the bodies of 
five hundred women, friends of Visākhā, made them drunk, and caused them to 
commit gross improprieties in the presence of the Buddha. DhA.iii.102.</p>
