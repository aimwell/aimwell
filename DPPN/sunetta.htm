<p><b>1. Sunetta. </b>Aggasāvaka of Sobhita Buddha 
(Bu.vii.21; J.i.35). He was the Buddha’s stepbrother and his first convert. 
BuA.137.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sunetta Thera. </b>Attendant of Dhammadassī Buddha. 
J.i.39; Bu.xvi.18.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sunetta.</b> A Pacceka Buddha. A man who had learnt 
the art of pelting stones with great skill, from the cripple of the Sālittaka 
Jātaka (q.v.), looking for a target for testing his skill, saw Sunetta entering 
the city for alms and aimed a pebble at his ear. The pebble went into one ear 
and out at the other, and the Pacceka Buddha died after suffering great pain. 
Men, who saw this, killed the stone thrower, and, after a sojourn in Avici, he 
became a sledgehammer ghost in Gijjhakūta (DhA.ii.71f; Pv.iv.16; PvA.283f).</p>
<p>On another occasion, the son of Kitavassa, king of 
Benares, saw Sunetta begging for alms, and, angered that he did not do him 
homage, took the begging bowl from Sunetta’s hand and dashed it to the ground. 
Pv.iii.2; iv.7; PvA.177f., 264.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sunetta. </b>A teacher of old. He had numerous 
disciples, and those who followed his teachings were reborn in the Brahma world 
and in various other worlds. Then Sunetta, seeing that some among his disciples 
were as good as himself, developed mettā to a much greater degree; but even so, 
he could not free himself from birth, old age, etc. It was because he had not 
comprehended Noble Conduct, Noble Concentration, Noble Wisdom, Noble Release. 
A.iv.103f.; he is referred to at A.iii.371; iv.135.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Sunetta Sutta.</b> Contains a list of teachers, 
including Sunetta (q.v.), who taught their followers the way to the Brahma 
world. A.iv.135.</p>
