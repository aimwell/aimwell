<hr>
<h4>1. Nandā</h4>
<p>Chief woman disciple of Dīpankara Buddha. Bu.ii.214; 
J.i.29.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nandā</h4>
<p>One of the four wives of Magha. When Magha and his friends 
built their hall, Nandā had a pond built in the grounds. As a result, she was 
reborn as the mate of Sakka, and the Nandāpokkharanī came into existence on 
account of her merit. J.i.201ff.; DhA.i.269f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nandā</h4>
<p>Three daughters of the Bodhisatta in one of his births.

<h4>4. Nandā</h4>
<p>Daughter of <a href="candakumaara.htm" title="c/candakumaara.htm">Candakumāra</a>, J.vi.134.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nandā</h4>
<p>A nun, sister of <a href="thulla_nandaa.htm" title="t/thulla_nandaa.htm">Thullanandā</a>. Her other two sisters 
were Nandavatī and Sundarinandā. Vin.iv.211, 259.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Nandā Therī</h4>
<p>Declared by the Buddha (A.i.25) to be foremost among nuns 
in meditative power (jhāyīnam). She was the daughter of 
<a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a> and 
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpatī</a> and was therefore Sister of
<a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda</a> Thera.</p>
<p>She is evidently to be identified with <a href="sundari_nandaa.htm" title="s/sundari_nandaa.htm">Sundarī-nandā</a>.</p>
<p>There were three therīs (SNA.i.241) of the name of Nandā 
who were ordained with Pajāpatī: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Nandā, sister of Nanda Thera (also evidently called 
  Sundarī-nandā and sometimes Rūpa-nandā 
  and even Janapadakalyāni-nandā), (E.g. AA.i.198; and 
  ThigA.80), </li>
  <li><a href="abhiruupa_nandaa_theri.htm" title="am/abhiruupa_nandaa_theri.htm">Abhirūpā-nandā</a> (daughter of 
  Khema the Sākyan) and </li>
  <li><a href="janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm" title="j/janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm">Janapadakalyāni-nanda</a> 
  (evidently sometimes also called Rūpā-nandā, 
  E.g.,DhA.iii.113f.). </li>
</ul>
<p>The legends about them seem to have been confused from 
very early times.</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Nandā</h4>

died at Nātika and having been reborn spontaneously in the Suddhāvāsā, there to 
pass away, never to return. D.ii.91; S.v.356f.</p>
<hr>
