<p>An heretical sect, which broke off from the Theravādins at 
the same time as the Vajjiputtakas. The sect was later divided into the 
Sabbatthivādins and the Dhammaguttikas (Mhv.v. 6, 8; Dpv.v.45, 47; MT. 174f.; 
Mhv. 96). They held that the truth of nirodha had two aspects (Kvu.ii.11; see 
also viii.9; xviii.6; xix.8; xx.5; and Rockhill, op. cit., 182-186, 191-192). 
Buddhadeva Thera, at whose request the Jātakatthakathā was written, belonged to 
the Mahimsāsaka Vamsa (J.i.1).</p>
<p>Fa Hsien found a group of monks belonging to this sect in 
Ceylon. (Giles, op. cit., p. 76.).</p>
