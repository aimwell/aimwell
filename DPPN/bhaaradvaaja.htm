<p><b>1. Bhāradvāja</b>. One of the two chief disciples of 
  <a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddha. J.i.43; Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.293.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2</b><b>. Bhāradvāja Thera</b>. He belonged to the Bhāradvājagotta and was a brahmin of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. He sent his son
<a href="kanhadinna_th.htm" title="ka/kanhadinna_th.htm">Kanhadinna</a> to 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, to study under a certain 
teacher, but, on the way there, the boy met a Thera, entered the Order, and 
became an arahant. Bhāradvāja, too, heard the Buddha preach at 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a>, became 
a monk, and attained arahantship. Later, when Kanhadinna visited the Buddha at 
Rājagaha, he met his father and learnt from him of his attainments.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago, Bhāradvāja met the Pacceka Buddha 
Sumana and gave him a vallīkāra fruit (Thag.vss.177 8; ThagA.i.302f). He is, 
perhaps, identical with Vallīkāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.416; but the 
same Apadāna verses are given under Bhalliya (ThagA.i.49).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhāradvāja Thera. </b>He was the eldest of a clan of Bhāradvājas living in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and his wife was a Dhanañjāni brahminee. The wife was a devout follower 
of the Buddha, and constantly sang the praises of the Buddha, of his teachings, 
and of the Order. Annoyed at this, Bhāradvāja went to the Buddha and asked a 
question. He was so pleased with the answer that he joined the Order and not 
long after became an arahant (S.i.160f), several of his brothers following his 
example. (See Bhāradvāja 5)</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span lang="en-us">4. </b><b>Bhāradvāja. </b>A young brahmin, pupil of 
<a href="taarukkha.htm" title="t/taarukkha.htm">Tārukkha</a>. A discussion between 
him and <a href="vaasettha.htm" title="va/vaasettha.htm">Vāsettha</a> led to the preaching of the 
<a href="tevijja_s.htm" title="t/tevijja_s.htm">Tevijja Sutta</a> (D.i.235), and 
also the <a href="vaasettha_sutta.htm" title="va/vaasettha_sutta.htm">Vāsettha Sutta</a> (SN., p.115ff.; M.ii.197f). </p>
<p>Bhāradvāja later became the Buddha’s follower (D.i.252; SN., 
p. 123). The <a href="agganna_sutta.htm" title="am/agganna_sutta.htm">Aggañña Sutta</a> was preached to him and to Vāsettha when they were 
undergoing the probationary period prior to their becoming fully ordained monks 
(D.iii.80).  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.860) that they accepted the Buddha as their 
teacher at the conclusion of the Vāsettha Sutta and entered the Order at the end 
of the Tevijja Sutta. Later, while meditating on the teachings of the Aggañña 
Sutta, they became arahants (DA.iii.872). According to Buddhaghosa, Bhāradvāja 
belonged to a noble family worth forty five crores (DA.iii.860).</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span lang="en-us">5. </b><b>Bhāradvāja. </b>The name of a brahmin clan; about twenty individuals 
belonging to this clan are mentioned in the Pitakas. In one family, living at 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, the eldest was married to a Dhanañjāni brahmince and later became an 
arahant. (See Bhāradvāja

<p>His brothers: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Akkosaka Bhāradvāja, 
  </li>
  <li>Asurindaka Bhāradvāja, 
  
  </li>
  <li>Bilangika Bhāradvāja and 
  </li>
  <li>Sangārava Bhāradvāja, followed him (S.i.160ff.; 
SA.i.175ff.; MA.ii.808). 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Several other Bhāradvājas living in Sāvatthi visited 
the Buddha there, and joined the Order and became arahants; viz.,

  </li>
  <li>Katthahāra Bhāradvāja and

<p>The Elder <a href="pindola.htm" title="pu/pindola.htm">Pindola</a> also belonged to the Bhāradvājagotta; so did 
Kāpathika (M.ii.169f). The gotta was evidently considered to be very ancient. 
Mention is made in the books of a Bhāradvāja is among the authors of the runes 
of the brāhmanas (E.g., D.i.242; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61, etc.). 
</p>
<p>The <a href="kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm" title="ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm">Kālingabodhi Jātaka</a> speaks of a Kālingabhāradvāja brahmin, while the 
brahmin carpenter in the <a href="phandana_jat_475.htm" title="pu/phandana_jat_475.htm">Phandana Jātaka</a> belongs to the same clan. 
</p>
<p>The purohita Sucīrata, of Dhanañjaya Koravya (in the 
<a href="sambhava_jat_515.htm" title="sa/sambhava_jat_515.htm">Sambhava Jataka</a>), is a Bhāradvāja, as is also Jūjaka of the 
<a href="vessantara_jat_547.htm" title="vy/vessantara_jat_547.htm">Vessantara 
Jātaka</a>. In a Vinaya passage (Vin.iv.6; but see DA.iii.860) the Bhāradvājagotta is mentioned together with the Kosiya as a low clan (hīnagotta).</p>
