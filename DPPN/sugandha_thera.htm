<p><b>1. Sugandha Thera. </b>He belonged to a rich family of 
S훮vatthi. In the past he had smeared the Gandhakuti of Kassapa Buddha with 
costly sandalwood paste and had desired that he might be reborn with a fragrant 
body: therefore he, on the day of his birth, and his mother, while she carried 
him, filled the house with fragrance hence his name. When he grew up, he heard 
Mah훮sela Thera preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in seven 
days.</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a hunter. Tissa Buddha 
saw him, and, out of compassion for him, left his footprint where the hunter 
might see it. The hunter recognized the footprint as that of a Great Being and 
offered to it karandaka flowers (Thag.vs.24; ThagA.i.80f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Karandapupphiya Thera of the 
Apad훮na. Ap.ii.434; the same verses occur at Ap.ii.383; cf. ThagA.i.270; i.405, 
where they are found under Subh큰ti.</p>
<p>Sugandha. A khattiya of thirty one kappas ago, a former 
birth of Atuma (Gandhodakiya) Thera. ThagA.i.162; Ap.i.158.</p>

<p><b>3. Sugandha Thera. </b>In the past he had been a 
setthiputta of Benares and had joined the Order under Kassapa Buddha, becoming 
famous as a preacher. After death he was born in Tusita, and in this life was 
born among men, with a fragrant body hence his name. He entered the Order and 
became an arahant. Ap.ii.459-63.</p>
