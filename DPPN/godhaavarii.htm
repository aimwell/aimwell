<p>1. Godhāvarī. (v.l. Godāvari).-A river 
in Dakkhināpatha, of which it forms the southern boundary. During the Buddha’s 
time, the Alaka (or Mulaka) king and the Assaka king (both Andhakas) had 
settlements on its northern bank, and Bāvarī’s hermitage lay in the territory 
between their dominions (SN.vs.977). The Commeutary (SNA.ii.581) says that near 
this spot the Godhāvarī divided into two branches, forming an island three 
leagues in extent, and the island was a dense forest, known as the Kapitthavana. 
Bāvarī’s hermitage occupied a region of five leagues. In the past this region 
had been the abode of various sages, such as Sarabhanga (J.v.132, 136; 
Mtu.i.363). According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.182), Bāvarī’s hermitage 
was on a bend of the river (Godhāvarīvanke). The Godhāvarī is one of the holiest 
rivers in Southern India, rising in Brahmagiri near the village of Triyanvaka 
and sanctified by its connection with Rāma and various saints.</p>
<p>2. Godhāvarī.-A canal, built by 
Parakkamabāhu I., connecting the Kāragangā and the Parakkamasāgara 
(Cv.lxxix.57).</p>
