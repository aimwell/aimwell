<p>1. Āyatana Sutta.-Once when the Buddha 
was staying in the Kūtāgarasālā in Vesāli, he preached to the monks a sermon on 
the six spheres of contact (salāyatana). The monks listened with rapt attention 
until Māra, making a terrible din, disturbed their peace of mind. The Buddha 
admonished the monks not to be led away by Māra, and the latter, discomfited, 
disappeared (S.i.112).</p>
<p>2. Āyatana Sutta.-The four Ariyan truths 
are concerned with the six personal spheres of sense. Effort should be made to 
realise this. S.v.426.</p>
