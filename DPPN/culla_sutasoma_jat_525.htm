<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as the son 
of the king of Sudassana (<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>), under the name of Soma. Because he was fond 
of Soma juice and poured out libations of it, they called him Sutasoma. When he 
came of age his father gave up the throne to him, and he had sixteen thousand 
wives, of whom Cand훮dev카 was the chief consort. As time went on his family 
became very great, and he wished to become an ascetic as soon as a grey hair 
appeared on his head. Every-one in the palace tried to turn him from this 
resolve; rich merchants, like Kulavaddhana, offered him their immense wealth, 
but all in vain. Having handed over the kingdom to his brother, Somadatta, he 
donned the garb of an ascetic and left the city unknown to anyone. When his 
departure was discovered, all the inhabitants of the city left their belongings 
to follow him. Sakka sent Vissakamma to build for them a hermitage thirty 
leagues in extent. J.v.177-92.</p>
