  <h2>Bhaddāli Thera</h2>

</ul>
<p>When the Buddha, at Jetavana, laid down the rule that 
monks should eat one meal a day and that in the morning, Bhaddāli protested and 
refused to keep this rule because he said that, in so eating, he would be a prey 
to scruples and misgivings. For three months he avoided the Buddha, until, just 
before the Buddha was starting on a journey, Bhaddāli, acting on the advice of 
his fellow monks, confessed his fault to the Buddha and begged for forgiveness 
(M.i.437ff). The Buddha praised this action and preached to him the Bhaddāli 
Sutta (q.v.).</p>
<p>It is said (MA.ii.648) that, in a previous birth, Bhaddāli 
had been a crow, therefore in this life he was always hungry and was known among 
his fellows as the Great Eater (Mahāchātaka).</p>
<p>Thirty kappas ago he met Sumedha Buddha in the forest, 
wrapt in meditation, and, having tidied the place where the Buddha was sitting, 
he erected over him a pavilion. Ap.ii.365f.</p>
