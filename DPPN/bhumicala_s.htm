  <h2>Bhūmicāla Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It records the incident, at the Cāpāla cetiya in Vesāli, 
of the Buddha giving Ānanda a last chance of asking him to prolong his life. 
When Ānanda fails to take advantage of this opportunity, the Buddha announces to 
Māra, who asks him to finish his life, that he will die at the end of three 
months. At this announcement there was a great earthquake, the reason for which 
Ānanda enquires of the Buddha, who enlightens him. A.iv.308ff; D.ii.102f.; 
S.v.259; Ud.vi.1.</p>
