<p><b>1. Dhammā Theri.</b>-She belonged to a 
respectable family in Sāvatthi and was given in marriage to a suitable husband. 
Having heard the Doctrine, she wished to join the Order, but her husband refused 
his permission. After his death she became a nun, and one day, while returning 
from her alms round, she slipped and fell. Meditating on this, she became an 
arahant. Thig.vs.17; ThigA.23f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dhammā.</b>-The chief woman disciple of Atthadassī Buddha. Bu.xv.20; J.i.39.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Dhammā.</b>-The fifth of the seven 
daughters of Kikī, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. For twenty thousand years she lived the life 
of celibacy. She is identified with Kisāgotamī. J.vi.431; Ap.ii.565.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Dhammā.</b>-Wife of Bindusāra and mother 
of Asoka. She had two sons, Asoka and Tissa. MT.189, 193; the “Kambodian” 
Mahavamsa (vs.1129) calls her Siridhammā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Dhammā.</b>-An eminent Therī of 
Anurādhapura, an expert teacher of the Vinaya. Dpv.xviii.14.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Dhammā.</b>-A very poor woman of Sīva 
village. Once she gave a garment to the monks of Giritimbilatissapabbata Vihāra, 
and they agreed among themselves that none but an arahant should wear it. One of 
them became an arahant that very day and wore it; he then passed it on to 
another, and before the end of the rains they all thus became arahants. On the 
day of the pavārana, King Lañjitissa ordered the monastery to be decorated. The 
monks setup Dhamma’s garment as a banner at the entrance. The king, having 
discovered the reason, gave Dhammā the village of Sīva, which then came to be 
called Dhammasīva. Ras.ii.42.</p>
