<p>A wolf once lived on a rock near the Ganges. The winter 
floods came and surrounded the rock, and the wolf, unable to escape, decided to 
keep the holy day. The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, appeared before him in the 
guise of a he goat, and the wolf, forgetting his holy day, chased him round and 
round the rock. Finding he could not succeed in catching him, the wolf expressed 
his joy that his holy day had not been violated! Sakka, hovering above him, 
rebuked him for his weakness.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to some monks, 
followers of Upasena (Vangantaputta) (q.v.). Being aware of the permission 
granted by the Buddha to the monks who practiced the thirteen dhutahgas to visit 
him even during his periods of solitude, these monks would practice them for a 
short while and then visit him. But, the visit over, they would at once throw 
off their rag robes and don other garments. The Buddha discovered this and 
related the Jﾄ》aka. J.ii.449ff.; cp. Vin.iii.231f., where no mention is made of 
the Jﾄ》aka.</p>
