<h4>Pañcāla, Pañcālajanapada, Pañcālarattha, Pañcālā</h4>
<p>One of the sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a> (A.i.213; iv.252, etc.). 
It consisted of two divisions: <a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttara Pañcāla</a> and Dakkhina Pañcāla. The river 
<a href="bhaagiirathii.htm" title="b/bhaagiirathii.htm">Bhagīrathi</a> formed the boundary between the divisions. According to the
<a href="kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm" title="ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm">Kumbhakāra Jātaka</a>, the capital of Uttara Pañcāla was Kampillanagara, where a 
king named <a href="dummukha.htm" title="d/dummukha.htm">Dummukha</a> once reigned. </p>
<p>J.iii.379; also Mtu.iii.26; but the Dvy. (435) calls the 
capital Hastināpura. According to the Mahābhārata (i.138, 73-4), the capital was 
Ahicchatra or Chatravatī, while the capital of Daksina-Pañcāla was Kāmpilya.</p>
<p>Pañcāla was to the east of the Kuru country, and, in 
ancient times, there seems to have been a constant struggle between the Kurus 
and the Pañcālas for the possession of Uttara-Pañcāla. Thus, sometimes, Uttara 
Pañcāla was included in the Kuru kingdom (E.g., J.v.444; also Mahābhārata 
i.138), but at other times it formed a part of Kampillarattha (E.g., J.iii.79; 
v. 21, 289) Kampilla probably being the capital of Dakkhina Pañcāla. So it 
happened that sometimes the kings of Kampillarattha had their capital in Uttara 
Pañcāla nagara, while at others the kings of Uttara Pañcāla-nagara had their 
capital in Kampilla nagara. <a href="cuulani_brahmadatta.htm" title="c/cuulani_brahmadatta.htm">Cūlanī Brahmadatta</a> is described in the
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahā 
Ummagga Jātaka</a> as king of Pañcāla, with his capital in Kampilla. </p>
<p>J.vi.329, 396, etc.; also PvA. 161; see also 
Uttarādhiyayana Sūtra (SBE. xlv. 57 61) and the Rāmāyana (i.32). Similarly 
Sambhūta was king of Uttara-Pañcāla (J.iv.392ff.). Sometimes the king of Pañcāla 
is merely spoken of as Pañcāla&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., J.iv.430, v. 98. See also 
Jayaddisa.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a chieftain (rājā) of Pañcāla 
even in the Buddha’s day, for we are told (ThagA.i.331) that Visākha 
Pañcāliputta (q.v.) was the son of the daughter of the “Pañcāla rājā.” Pañcāla 
is generally identified (Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, p. 19.) with the country 
to the north and west of Delhi, from the foot of the Himālaya to the river 
Chambal.</p>

<h4>Pañcāla Vagga</h4>
<p>The fifth section of the Navaka Nipāta of the Anguttara 
Nikāya. A.iv.449 54.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pañcāla Sutta</h4>
<p>A discussion between Ānanda and Udāyi (Kāludāyi) regarding 
a verse uttered by the devaputta Pañcālacanda (See S.i.48) as to what 
constitutes obstacles (sambādha) in the world and what release therefrom (okāsādhigama). 
Udāyi says that the five sensuous pleasures are the sambādha, and that 
okāsadhigama consists in the attainment of the jhānas. A.iv.449f.; AA.ii.815.</p>
