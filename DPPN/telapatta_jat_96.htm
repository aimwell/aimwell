<p>The Bodhisatta was once the youngest of 
one hundred sons of the king of Benares. He heard from the Pacceka Buddhas, who 
took their meals in the palace, that he would become king of Takkasilā if he 
could reach it without falling a prey to the ogresses who waylaid travellers in 
the forest. Thereupon, he set out with five of his brothers who wished to 
accompany him. On the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to 
the charms of the ogresses, and were devoured. One ogress followed the 
Bodhisatta right up to the gates of Takkasilā, where the king took her into the 
palace, paying no heed to the Bodhisatta’s warning. The king succumbed to her 
wiles, and, during the night, the king and all the inhabitants of the palace 
were eaten by the ogress and her companions. The people, realising the sagacity 
and strength of will of the Bodhisatta, made him their king.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the Janapada-Kalyāni Sutta (q.v.). The monks said it must be very hard not to 
look at a janapada-kalyāni, but the Buddha denied this and related the above 
story (J.i.393ff).</p>
<p>The Jātaka seems also to have been 
called the Takkasilā Jātaka (J.i.470).</p>
