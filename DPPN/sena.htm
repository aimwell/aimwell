<h4>1. Sena</h4>
<p>King of Ceylon (Sena I., 831-51 A.C.). He was the younger 
brother and the successor of Aggabodhi IX. He had three younger brothers: 
Mahinda, Kassapa and Udaya. His queen was Sanghā. During his reign the Pandu 
king invaded Ceylon, and Sena had to retire into the Malaya district. After the 
army of the Pandu king had plundered a great part of the kingdom, Sena made a 
treaty with him and re-gained his throne. He adopted the three sons and the 
three daughters of Kittaggabodhi: Kassapa, Sena and Udaya, and Sanghā, Tissā and 
Kitti. Among the king’s good acts was the construction of a monastery on 
Aritthapabbata for the Pamsukulikas, and a many storeyed pāsāda in Jetavana. He 
also built the Vīrankurārāma, the Pubbārāma, Sangha-sena-parivena, Senaggabodhi-vihāra, 
a refectory in the Mahāmettapabbata-vihāra, and single cells in the Kappūra&nbsp; 
and Uttarālha-parivenas. He completed the Dappulapabbata-&nbsp; and the 
Kassaparājaka-vihāras. Among Sena’s ministers were Bhadda (the senāpati), 
Uttara, Vajira and Rakkhasa. His capital was in Pulatthinagara (Cv.l.1ff). He 
was also known as Silāmegha (Cv.l.43). </p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Sena</h4>
<p>Son of the Adipāda Kassapa, and therefore nephew of&nbsp; 
Sena I. On the death of his father, Sena became king as Sena II. (851-85 A.C.). 
He married Sanghā, daughter of Kittaggabodhi, and had a son, Kassapa. Sena sent 
an expeditionary force against the Pandu king, captured Madhurā, and brought 
back the treasures which had been pillaged by the Pandus in the time of Sena I. 
The Pamsukulika monks separated from the incumbents of Abhayagiri in the 
twentieth year of Sena’s reign. He built the Manimekhala dam and a dam across 
the Kanavāpi at Katthantanagara. He endowed various monasteries — Buddhagāma, 
Mahiyangana, Kūtatissa, Mandalagiri, and Sobbha — and held a special ceremony in 
honour of the image of Ānanda. He held a consecration festival at the Hemavāluka-cetiya 
(Mahā Thūpa), and decreed that this festival should be repeated annually. His 
senāpati was Kutthaka. Cv.li.1ff.</p>

absent, Sena V. had the senāpati’s younger brother, Mahāmalla, slain for an 
offence with the queen mother, and appointed a court official Udaya as senāpati. 
When Sena senāpati heard of this, he marched against the king, who had to flee 
to Rohana. The queen mother joined Sena, and he lived in Pulatthipura. This

some time the king had to live in Rohana from fear of Sena. But later he made 
peace, and married Sena’s daughter and had a son, Kassapa. The king drank much, 
and died of digestive trouble in the tenth year of his reign. Cv.liv.57-72.</p>
