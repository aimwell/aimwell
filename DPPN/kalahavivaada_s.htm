<p>One of the six suttas preached at the 
<a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya</a> held in the Mahāvana near Kapilavatthu. It deals with the 
origin of contentions and disputes. Disputes arise about objects which one holds 
dear; such affection is the result of desire, etc. It forms the eleventh sutta 
of the Atthakavagga of the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a> (Sn.vv.862ff; SnA.361, 551ff).</p>
<p>It is said that the discourse was 
specially meant for those in the Assembly, whose temperament was malicious (dosacaritānam) 
(MNidA.222).  </p>
<p>We are told that <a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā-Pajāpatī</a> heard the sutta and renounced the 
world. ThigA.3, 141.</p>
<p>Probably the <a href="attadanda_s.htm" title="ay/attadanda_s.htm">Attadanda Sutta</a> was 
also called by this name. See AA.i.186, where the story of the 500 Sākiyan youths 
is given. In other accounts the Sutta which led to their joining the Order is 
called Attadanda. See <a href="rohini.htm" title="r/rohini.htm">Rohinī</a>. (3).</p>
