<p>Son of the chief treasurer of Rājagaha. 
Plague breaks out in the city and attacks the chief treasurer and his wife. When 
about to die they bid farewell to Kumbhaghosaka, directing him to flee for his 
life and return later to dig up their treasure. He spends twelve years in a 
jungle and returns to find the treasure undisturbed; but reflecting that since 
he is unknown in the city he may be subjected to annoyance if he is seen digging 
up the treasure and spending it, he decides to earn his own living and obtains a 
position as foreman. One day the king, hearing his voice, exclaims: “That is the 
voice of some rich man.” Several times this happens, and then a female servant, 
overhearing the king’s words, offers for a consideration to make him master of 
the man’s wealth. She obtains lodgings for herself and her daughter in 
Kumbhaghosaka’s house and contrives to make him seduce her daughter. A marriage 
is arranged, and Kumbhaghosaka is obliged to dig up some of the wealth in order 
to defray the various expenses proclaimed by the king’s orders. When the plot is 
complete, Kumbhaghosaka is summoned before the king, who, having heard his 
story, confirms him in his inheritance and gives him his own daughter as wife.</p>
<p>The king tells the story to the Buddha, 
who praises Kumbhaghosaka. DhA.i.321ff.</p>
