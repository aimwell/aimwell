<p>A Yakkha. Once, when the Buddha was at the Tankitamañca in 
Gayā, which was the abode of Suciloma, Suciloma and his friend, Khara, happened 
to be passing by, and Suciloma, coming up to the Buddha, bent his body against 
the Buddha’s. The Buddha bent his body in the opposite direction, saying that 
contact with him was an evil thing. Then Suciloma asked him a question regarding 
the origin of various persuasions, and the Buddha answered him (Ap.ii.434; the 
same verses occur).</p>
<p>It is said that Suciloma was a lay follower of Kassapa 
Buddha and used to visit the vihāra eight times a month to hear the Dhamma. 
(SNA.i.302, 305; in the Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.233) he is said to have been a 
monk). One day, when he heard the gong announcing the preaching, he was working 
in a field near the vihāra, and thinking he would be late if he stayed to wash, 
he entered the uposatha hall, where he lay on a very costly rug. As a result of 
this action, the hairs of his body resembled needles hence his name. At the end 
of the Buddha’s sermon Suciloma became a sotāpanna.</p>
<p>An expressive statue of Suciloma is to be found among the 
bas-reliefs of the Bhārhūt Stūpa. Cunningham: Bhārhūt, p.136.</p>
