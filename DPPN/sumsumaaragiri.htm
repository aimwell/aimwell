<p>A city in the <a href="bhagga.htm" title="b/bhagga.htm">Bhagga</a> country, of which it was probably the 
capital (See, e.g., Sp.iv.862). The  <span lang="en-us">
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> </span>spent the eighth vassa there (BuA.3). 
Near the city was the <a href="bhesakalavava.htm" title="b/bhesakalavava.htm">Bhesakalāvana</a> where the Buddha stayed. </p>
<p>During his visits there he preached the <a href="anumana_sutta.htm" title="ay/anumana_sutta.htm">Anumāna Sutta</a> 
(M.i.95f ) and the <a href="bodhirajakumara_s.htm" title="b/bodhirajakumara_s.htm">Bodhirāja Sutta</a> (M.ii.91f). The city was the residence of
<a href="nakulapita.htm" title="n/nakulapita.htm">Nakulapītā</a> and his wife, with whom the Buddha had several interviews. (E.g., 
A.ii.61; iii.295 f; iv.268; S.iii.1; iv.116). </p>
<p>It is said that once, when the 
Buddha was at Sumsumāragiri, he saw with his divine eye 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> at
<a href="kallavaala.htm" title="ka/kallavaala.htm">Kallavālamutta</a> half asleep, and appeared before him and admonished him 
(A.iv.85). </p>
<p>On another occasion, he saw <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> in the Veluvana in the Ceti 
country, pondering over the seven <a href="mahapurisavitakka_s.htm" title="maha/mahapurisavitakka_s.htm">Mahāpurisavitakkas</a>, and appeared before him to 
encourage him (A.iv.228f). Both incidents show that the Buddha visited 
Sumsumāragiri quite early in his career, in the first year after the 
Enlightenment. Moggallāna also stayed in Sumsumāragiri, and there 
<a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> is said 
to have entered his stomach and to have given him trouble (M.i.332f.; cf. 
Thag.vs.1208). </p>
<p>Sumsumāragiri was the birthplace of <a href="sirimanda_thera.htm" title="s/sirimanda_thera.htm">Sirimanda Thera</a> 
(ThagA.i.462) and the scene of the meditations of Singālakapitā.</p>
<p>Several Vinaya rules were passed during the Buddha’s stay 
at Sumsumāragiri (Vin.ii.127; iv.115f; 198f). </p>
<p>The <a href="dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm" title="d/dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm">Dhonasākha Jātaka</a> was preached there (J.iii.157f). 
Prince <a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhi</a>, the governor of the 
<a href="bhagga.htm" title="b/bhagga.htm">Bhagga</a> country, evidently lived in 
Sumsumāragiri, and it was there that he had his famous palace, called 
<a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanada</a>.</p>
<p>It is said (MA.i.292; SA.ii.181) that the city was so 
called because when it was being built a crocodile (sumsumāra) made a noise in a 
lake near by.</p>
