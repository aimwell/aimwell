<p>The people of Kerala. The Keralas served 
as mercenary soldiers to the kings of Ceylon. They rebelled against Mahinda V. 
and governed certain parts of the country (Cv.iv.5, 12). They fought in the army 
of Parakkamabāhu I. against Gajabāhu (Cv.lxix.18; lxx.230). Later, when 
Parakkamabāhu’s forces were employed in Rohana, the Kerala mercenaries in 
Kotthasāra conspired with others to capture Rājarattha, but their attempt was 
foiled (Cv.lxxiv.44f). The Keralas formed the largest part of Māgha’s army which 
devastated Ceylon, and Māgha gave over to them, for their use, whatever they 
coveted in the conquered territory. They overran the country, carrying 
destruction wherever they went (Cv.lxxx.61, 76; lxxi.4). Later, however, they 
suffered severe defeat at the hands of Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxiii.20). Once a 
Pandu king fled from the Cola king and took refuge among the Keralas (Cv.liii.9; 
Cv. Trs.i.172, n.3).</p>
