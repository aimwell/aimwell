  <h2>Khandahāla Jātaka (No.542)</h2>

<p>Khandahāla was the chaplain of King 
<a href="ekaraaja.htm" title="e/ekaraaja.htm">Ekarājā</a> of Pupphavatī. The chaplain took bribes, and the king’s son, Candakumāra, 
having been told of this, once righted a wrong decision, thereby winning the 
applause of the people. The king appointed him judge, and Khandahāla vowed 
vengeance. Later the king, having dreamed of heaven, asked Khandahāla the way 
thither; the chaplain replied that the way lay through a sacrifice in which all 
the king’s sons, his queens, his merchant princes, and his most treasured 
possessions should be offered. Khandahāla hoped thereby to bring about the death 
of Candakumāra. Ekarājā accepted the suggestion and made all preparations for 
the sacrifice. Several times the king wavered in his resolve, being interceded 
with by his parents, Canda and his wives, and the people. Khandahāla goaded him 
on, but at the moment when the sword was about to descend on the neck of 
Candakumāra, the latter’s wife, Candā, daughter of the Pañcāla king, made an 
“act of truth,” and Sakka appeared, brandishing a thunderbolt. Canda was saved, 
the crowd killed Khandahāla, and would have killed the king too but for the 
intervention of Sakka. The king was made an outcast and banished from the city, 
and Candakumāra, now the crowned king, supplied all his wants. (J.vi.129-57; the 
story is also found in the <a href="cariyaapitaka.htm" title="c/cariyaapitaka.htm">Cariyāpitaka</a> as the Candakumāra-cariyā).</p>
<p>Khandahāla is identified with <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>, Candā with 
<a href="rahulamata.htm" title="r/rahulamata.htm">Rāhulamātā</a>, and Candakumāra with the 
<a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha by engaging the services of archers to 
shoot him.</p>
<p>The story is referred to as an example 
of a husband being saved by the virtue of his wife (J.iv.47), and also of one 
instance of Devadatta having greater power than the Bodhisatta (Mil.203).</p>
<p>The Jātaka is sometimes called the 
Candakumāra Jātaka.</p>
