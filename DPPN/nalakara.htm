<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>. In his 
previous life he had been a farmer in Benares. One day, while going to his 
fields, he saw a <a href="pacceka_buddha.htm" title="pa/pacceka_buddha.htm">Pacceka Buddha</a>. Thereupon he turned back, took the Pacceka 
Buddha home, fed him, and, with his son, built for him a hut with reed walls, on 
the banks of the Ganges, looked after him in the rains and gave him robes to 
wear. </p>
