<p>In a Brahmin family of Benares, the two sons and the 
daughter heard the Doctrine from Sankicca Thera and became believers. The 
parents were anxious to give their daughter to their nephew, but he had joined 
the Order. Later, however, wishing to marry his cousin, he asked his teacher’s 
permission to become a layman. The latter withheld his consent for some time, 
and, while he hesitated, the house in which the family lived fell down and they 
were all killed. </p>
<p>The two sons and the daughter were born among the bhumma 
devas and the parents became petas. The young monk’s teacher showed them to him 
one day as he passed behind the monastery at Isipatana, and having heard their 
story from their own lips, the monk caused alms to be given in the name of the 
petas, and they were freed from their sufferings. Pv.i.11; PvA.53ff.</p>
