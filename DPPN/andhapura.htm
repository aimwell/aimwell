<p>A city in the Seriva country, on the 
bank of the river Telavāha. It was whilst doing business as a hawker here that 
the Bodhisatta, born as Seriva, crossed the wishes of another hawker, who in the 
present age was Devadatta. This was the beginning of Devadatta’s enmity towards 
the Buddha. J.i.111, 113.</p>
