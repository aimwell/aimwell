<h4>1. Nalamāliya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Once he gave a fan, made of reeds, to 
Padumuttara Buddha, who praised his gift. He became king many times under the 
name of Subbata and eight times under that of Māluta (Ap.i.143f.) He is probably 
identical with Kutivihāriya Thera (ThagA.i.131).</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nalamāliya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Thirty one kappas ago he saw Sikhi Buddha and 
gave him a garland of reed flowers (Ap.ii.412). He is probably identical with 
Dhaniya Thera (ThagA.i.347).</p>
