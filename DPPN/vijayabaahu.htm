<p><b>1. Vijayabāhu. </b>King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu I., 1059-1114 
A.C.). His earlier name was Kitti; his parents were Moggallāna and Lokitā 
(Cv.lvii.42f.; but see Cv.Trs.i.201, n.1), and from his thirtieth year he lived 
in Mūlasālā. Later, without the knowledge of his parents, he left home, defeated 
the general Loka, and became Adipāda of Malaya after bringing this province 
under his power. At the age of sixteen he defeated Kassapa, chief of the 
Kesadhātus, and became ruler of Rohana as well, assuming the title of Yuvarāja 
and the name of Vijayabāhu. At this time the Colas were in possession of the 
government at Pulatthipura, and they made efforts to stem the advance of 
Vijayabāhu. They were at first successful, owing to the disunion among the 
Singhalese themselves, but Vijayabāhu conquered the Cola armies near 
Palutthapabbata and marched to Pulatthipura. He was helped by forces sent by the 
king of Rāmañña, to whom he sent an embassy with various presents. He had, 
however, to bide his time, and retreated to Vātagiri. From there he went, in due 
course, to Mahānāgahula, his officers having, in the meantime, crushed all 
opposition in Dakkhinadesa and captured the province of Anurādhapura and the 
district round Mahātittha. When he felt the right moment had arrived, Vijayabāhu 
marched once more to Pulatthipura and captured it after a siege of one and a 
half months. From there he advanced to Anurādhapura, spent three months in the 
city and returned to Pulatthipura. This was fifteen years after he became 
Yuvarāja. In the eighteenth year he crowned himself king, under the title of 
Sirisanghabodhi, making his younger brother Vīrabāhu Yuvarāja and governor of 
Dakkhinadesa, and his other brother, Jayabāhu, Adipāda and governor of Rohana. 
The king had several queens, among whom was Līlāvatī, a Cola princess and 
daughter of Jagatīpāla; by her he had a daughter Yasodharā. Another of his 
queens was a Kālinga princess, Tilokasundarī, by whom he had five daughters&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Subhaddā, Sumittā, Lokanāthā, Ratanāvalī and Rūpavatī&nbsp;&nbsp; and a son 
called Vikkamabāhu. Vijayabāhu gave his younger sister, Mittā, in marriage to 
the king of Pandu, refusing an offer of marriage made by the Cola king.</p>
<p>When peace had been established, Vijayabāhu sent 
messengers to Anuruddha, king of Rāmañña, and fetched monks from that country to 
help in the reformation of the Sangha in Ceylon. He gave over the whole district 
of Alisāra for the use of the monks and built many vihāras. He translated the 
Dhammasangani and held an annual Dandissara offering. He also had the Tipitaka 
copied, and presented the copies to various monks. Because the Singhalese envoys 
sent to Kannāta were insulted and maimed, the king prepared to send a punitive 
expedition to Cola, but the Velakkāra troops revolted, captured Mittā and her 
children, and burned the king’s palace. The king was forced to retreat to 
Dakkhinadesa but, with the help of Vīrabāhu, he defeated the rebels. In the 
forty fifth year of his reign he took an army to Cola and stopped at a seaport 
in that country; but as the Cola king refused to accept his challenge to fight, 
he returned to his own country. He repaired many tanks and restored many vihāras 
in various parts of the country. He provided facilities for pilgrims journeying 
to Samantakūta, and patronized the Lābhavāsī and the Vantajīvaka monks. He ruled 
for fifty five years. Vīrabāhu died before him, and he made Jayabāhu Uparāja in 
his place. For details of Vijayabāhu’s reign, see Cv. chaps. lviii lx.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vijayabāhu.</b> Sister’s son of Parakkamabāhu I. and 
king of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu II., 1186-87 A.C.). He 
succeeded his uncle. Among his acts was the grant of an amnesty to all those 
imprisoned by Parakkamabāhu I., and the dispatch of an embassy to the king of 
Arimaddana with a letter in Pāli, composed by himself. He was a good king, but 
was slain at the end of one year’s reign by Mahinda (afterwards Mahinda VI.). 
His viceroy was Kittinissanka. Cv.lxxx.1-18.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vijayabāhu.</b> King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu III., 
1232-36 A.C.). He claimed descent from King 
Sirisanghabodhi I. and was lord of the Vannī. He found the government of Ceylon 
in the hands of the Damilas, and, after defeating them, he established the seat 
of government in Jambuddoni. He sent for the monks, who, with Vācissara at their 
head, had left Ceylon during the preceding disturbed period and had deposited 
the Buddha’s Alms bowl and Tooth Relic in the rock fortress at Billasela. The 
king did much for the reform of the priesthood and built various monasteries, 
chief of which was the Vijayasundarārāma and the Vijayabāhu vihāra. He had two 
sons, Parakkamabāhu and Bhuvanekabāhu. He appointed the Elder Sangharakkhita as 
head of the Order in Ceylon. Cv.lxxxi.10ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vijayabāhu.</b> King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu IV., 1271-72 
A.C.). He was the eldest of the five sons of 
Parakkamabāhu II., his brothers being Bhuvanekabāhu, Tibhuvanamalla, 
Parakkamabāhu and Jayabāhu. With the consent of the monks, Parakkamabāhu II. 
handed over the government, before his death, to Vijayabāhu, who was evidently 
very popular, and was known among his subjects as a Bodhisatta. (See, e.g., 
Cv.lxxxviii.35). He restored Pulatthipura and built and renovated numerous 
monasteries, among them the vihāra at Titthagāma. During his reign, Candabhānu 
invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the king with the help of his Adipāda, 
Vīrabāhu. Vijayabāhu built a city near Subhagiri and made it his seat of 
government. He restored the Ratnāvalī cetiya and gave Anurādhapura into the 
charge of the Vanni chiefs. Later, when Vīrabāhu had completely restored 
Pulatthipura, the king was consecrated there in the presence of his father, who 
came over from Jambuddoni. Then, at the desire of his father, he held, on the 
Mahāvālukagangā, at Sahassatittha, a festival for admission into the Order. The 
celebrations lasted a fortnight, and the king conferred on the monks various 
ranks, such as mahāsāmipāda, mūlatherapāda, parivenathera, etc. Two years after 
the death of Parakkamabāhu, Vijayabāhu was slain by a treacherous general, named 
Mitta. For details regarding Vijayabāhu, see Cv.lxxxvii.14 xc.1. </p>
<p>Vijayabāhu’s son was Parakkamabāhu III . Cv.xc.48.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vijayabāhu.</b> King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu V.). He 
succeeded Vannibhuvanekabāhu, and was himself succeeded by Bhuvanekabāhu IV. 
Cv.xc.105; he was among the successors of Parakkamabāhu IV., and reigned 
somewhere between 1302 and 1346 A.C.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vijayabāhu.</b> King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu VI.). He 
was one of the successors of Parakkamabāhu VI. His immediate predecessor was 
Vīraparakkamabāhu. Cv.xcii.4; his reign was somewhere between 1405 and 1411 A.C.</p>
