<p>Perhaps the generic name given to the 
king of the Kurūs (cf. Brahmadatta). Once in the Jātakas Koravya is given as the 
name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of 
Sutasoma (J.v.457). Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 
268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs. Koravya 
may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as 
Kururatthavāsika (E.g., J.vi.273). The Koravya king probably belonged to the 
Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361). The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.369f) mentions a king 
Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha. According to the 
Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see 
Ratthapāla), in the Buddha’s day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarājā, 
and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migācīra (q.v.). This king 
was evidently interested in religious discussion. Thullakotthika was his 
capital. The Avadānasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb. Hist. of India, i.121, 
which refers to a half-mythical Pañcāla king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of 
Thullakotthika.</p>
