</ul>
<p>Nephew of Devānampiyatissa. He was the king’s chief 
minister, and led the embassy which was sent to Asoka soon after 
Devānampiyatissa ascended the throne (Mhv.xi.20). Asoka conferred on him the 
title of Senāpati (Mhv.xi.25). It is said that he had fifty five elder and 
younger brothers who all joined the Order at Cetiyagiri at the end of a sermon 
by Mahinda on the Vassūpanāyikakhandha (Mhv.xvi.10). This was before the 
commencement of the rainy season, but elsewhere (Mhv.xviii.3; perhaps here we 
have to deal with two different traditions) it is said that Arittha was sent in 
the month of Assayuja — after the pavārana, when 
the rains were over — to Pātaliputta to fetch 
Sanghamittā and the Bodhi tree from the court of Asoka, and that, he agreed to 
go only on condition that he should join the Order on his return. The king 
consented, and, his mission successfully concluded, he entered the Order with 
five hundred others and attained arahantship (Mhv.xix.5, 12, 66). He died in the 
reign of Uttiya (Mhv.xx.54). </p>
<p>The Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.102ff) gives an account of a 
recital (sangīti) held in Ceylon by Mahā Arittha. The scene was the parivena of 
the minister Meghavannābhaya in the Thūpārāma, where sixty eight thousand monks 
were assembled. A seat, facing south, was provided for Mahinda, Arittha’s seat, 
the dhammāsana, facing north. Arittha occupied this seat at Mahinda’s request, 
and sixty eight Mahā-theras, led by Mahinda, sat around him. Devānampiyatissa’s 
younger brother, Mattābhaya Thera, with five hundred others, were present in 
order to learn the Vinaya, the king also being present. When Arittha began his 
recital of the Vinaya, many miracles occurred. This was on the first day of the 
pavārana ceremony in the month of Kattika.</p>
<p>Mahā Arittha’s chief disciples were Tissadatta, Kālasumana 
and Dīghasumana (q.v.).</p>
