<p>King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. The king of Kosala 
invaded his father’s kingdom and, having killed the king, took away the queen, 
who was pregnant. When the child was born he was cast into the cemetery lest he 
should be slain by the Kosala king. The boy was discovered by a goatherd and 
brought up as his son, but from the day of the boy’s arrival in the goatherd’s 
home, the latter’s animals began to die off. He was therefore named Elakamāra 
(“Goat’s Bane”). The goatherd, thereupon, put him into a pot and cast him into 
the river, where he was picked up by a low-caste mender of old rubbish and 
adopted as his son. When he grew up the boy went to the palace with his father, 
and there the princess Kurangavī, of great beauty, fell in love with him. The 
servants discovered them guilty of illicit relations and reported them to the 
king. When the lad was about to be put to death for his misdemeanour, the queen; 
possessed by the spirit of Elakamāra’s dead father, who had been born as his 
guardian angel, confessed that he was no mere outcaste, but the son of the king 
of Benares. The Kosala king restored to Elakamāra his father’s inheritance and 
married him to Kurangavī. Chalangakumāra was given to him as his teacher, and 
was later appointed commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>Kurangavī misbehaved with Chalangakumāra 
as well as with his servant, Dhanantevāsī (J.v.430ff).</p>
<p>The story of Elakamāra was one of the 
stories mentioned by Kunāla in his famous sermon on the frailty of women 
(J.v.424).</p>
