  <li>
  <h2>Mahāgosinga Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A discussion in Gosingasālavana, between Sāriputta, Mahā 
Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata and Ānanda. Sāriputta is visited by 
the others in the evening, and asks them what type of monk would illumine the 
Gosinga wood. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ānanda speaks of one who treasures what he has been 
  taught and learns by heart the doctrines which declare the higher life in all 
  its perfection and purity; </li>
  <li>Revata of one who delights in meditation and lives in 
  solitude; </li>
  <li>Anuruddha of one who possesses the celestial eye;
  </li>
  <li>Mahā Kassapa of one living in the forest a strenuous 
  life, recommends that life; </li>
  <li>Moggallāna, of one who holds discussions with another 
  on the Abhidhamma; </li>
  <li>Sāriputta of a monk who is master of his heart and is 
  not under its mastery. </li>
</ul>
<p>They all seek the Buddha and ask for his opinion. He 
praises the opinion of each of the Elders, but he himself would choose a monk 
who is delivered from the āsavas. M.i.212-19.</p>
