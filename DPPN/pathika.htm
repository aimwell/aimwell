<p>An Ājīvaka of Sāvatthi. He was looked after by a woman of 
Sāvatthi who, hearing one day her neighbours praise the Buddha, wished to invite 
him to her home. Pāthika dissuaded her from so doing; but one day, unbeknown to 
him, she sent her son to invite the Buddha. The boy called at Pāthika’s 
hermitage on the way, and the ascetic tried to dissuade him from going. Failing 
to do so, he told him not to tell the Buddha where to find the house, hoping 
that thus they would be able to eat themselves all the food prepared for the 
Buddha. The boy did as he was told, and the next day he and Pāthika hid in a 
room at the back of the house. The Buddha came, and, after the meal, thanked the 
woman. But when Pāthika heard her applaud the Buddha’s sermon, he could no 
longer forbear and rushed forth to abuse her. DhA.i.376ff.</p>
