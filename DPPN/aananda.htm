<p><b>1. Ä€nanda.</b>-One of the principal 
disciples of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. He was a first cousin of the Buddha and was deeply 
attached to him.</p>
<p>He came to earth from <a href="tusita.htm" title="t/tusita.htm">Tusita</a> and was 
born on the same day as the <a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>, his father being
<a href="amitodana.htm" title="am/amitodana.htm">Amitodana</a> the <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">
SÄkiyan</a>, 
brother of <a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a>.
<a href="mahanama_th.htm#3" title="maha/mahanama_th.htm#3">MahÄnÄma</a> and 
<a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> were therefore his brothers 
(or probably step-brothers). According to the Mtu.iii.176, Ä€nanda was the son of Suklodana and the brother of Devadatta and UpadhÄna. His mother was MrgÄ«.</p>
<p>Ä€nanda entered the Order in the second 
year of the Buddhaâ€™s ministry, together with other SÄkiyan princes, such as 
<a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya</a>, <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a>,
<a href="bhagu_th.htm" title="b/bhagu_th.htm">Bhagu</a>, <a href="kimbila.htm" title="ku/kimbila.htm">Kimbila</a> and 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>, and was ordained by the 
Buddha himself (Vin.ii.182), his upajjhÄya being 
<a href="belatthasisa_th.htm" title="b/belatthasisa_th.htm">BelatthasÄ«sa</a> (ThagA.i.68; also 
DA.ii.418ff.; Vin.i.202; iv. 86). Soon after, he heard a discourse by 
<a href="punna.htm#Mantaniputta" title="pu/punna.htm#Mantaniputta">Punna 
MantÄniputta</a> and became a SotÄpanna. In S.iii.105 Ä€nanda acknowledges his 
indebtedness to Punna and gives an account of Punnaâ€™s sermon to him.</p>
<p>During the first twenty years after the 
Enlightenment, the Buddha did not have the same personal attendants all the 
time. From time to time various monks looked after him, among them being 
<a href="nagasamala_th.htm" title="n/nagasamala_th.htm">NÄgasamÄla</a>, <a href="nagita.htm" title="n/nagita.htm">NÄgita</a>, UpavÄna, Sunakkhatta, the novice Cunda, SÄgata, RÄdha and 
Meghiya. We are told that the Buddha was not particularly pleased with any of 
them. At the end of twenty years, at an assembly of the monks, the Buddha 
declared that he was advanced in years and desired to have somebody as his 
permanent body-servant, one who would respect his wishes in every way. The 
Buddha says that sometimes his attendants would not obey him, and on certain 
occasions had dropped his bowl and robe and gone away, leaving him.</p>
<p>All the great disciples offered their 
services, but were rejected by the Buddha. Ä€nanda alone was left; he sat in 
silence. When asked why he did not offer himself, his reply was that the Buddha 
knew best whom to choose. When the Buddha signified that he desired to have 
Ä€nanda, the latter agreed to accept the post on certain conditions. The Buddha 
was never to give him any choice food or garment (*) gotten by him, nor appoint 
for him a separate â€œfragrant cellâ€ (residence), nor include him in the 
invitations accepted by the Buddha. For, he said, if the Buddha did any of these 
things, some would say that Ä€nandaâ€™s services to the Buddha were done in order 
to get clothes, good fare and lodging and be included in the invitations. 
Further he was to be allowed to accept invitations on behalf of the Buddha; to 
bring to the Buddha those who came to see him from afar; to place before the 
Buddha all his perplexities, and the Buddha was to repeat to him any doctrine 
taught in his absence. If these concessions were not granted, he said, some 
would ask where was the advantage of such service. Only if these privileges were 
allowed him would people trust him and realise that the Buddha had real regard 
for him. The Buddha agreed to the conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*) Ä€nanda did, however, accept one of 
  the two robes given by Pukkusa the Mallan to the Buddha (D.ii.133); 
  Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that Ä€nandaâ€™s period of service had now 
  come to an end, and also he wished to be free from the accusation that even 
  after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years, the Buddha had never 
  made him any gift. It is further stated that Ä€nanda offered the robe to the 
  Buddha later (DA.ii.570).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thenceforth, for twenty-five years 
(Thag.v.1039), Ä€nanda waited upon the Buddha, following him like a shadow, 
bringing him water and toothpick, washing his feet, accompanying him everywhere, 
sweeping his cell and so forth. By day he was always at hand, forestalling the 
Masterâ€™s slightest wish; at night, stout staff and large torch in hand, he would 
go nine times round the Buddhaâ€™s Gandha-kuti in order to keep awake, in case he 
were needed, and also to prevent the Buddhaâ€™s sleep from being disturbed. 
</p>
<p>The account here given is summarised 
from AA.i.159ff. and from ThagA.ii.121ff. On the boons see J.iv.96, where Ä€nanda 
had asked for boons in the past too. The Tibetan sources give a different and 
interesting version of Ä€nandaâ€™s entry into the Order. See Rockhill: Life of the 
Buddha, 57-8.</p>
<p>Many examples are given of- Ä€nandaâ€™s 
solicitude for the Buddha, particularly during the Buddhaâ€™s last days, as 
related in the MahÄ ParinibbÄna Sutta. Ä€nanda was the Buddhaâ€™s equal in age 
(having been born on the same day), and it is touching to read of this old and 
most devoted attendant ministering to his eminent cousin, fetching him water, 
bathing him, rubbing his body, preparing his bed, and receiving last 
instructions from him on various matters of importance. It is said that when the 
Buddha was ill, Ä€nanda became sympathetically sick (D.ii.99). He was aware of 
every change that occurred in the Buddhaâ€™s body. E.g., the brightening of his 
features after Janavasabhaâ€™s visit (D.ii.204); and the fading of his complexion 
just before death, which was apparent when the Buddha put on the robe given by 
Pukkusa (ibid., 133).</p>
<p>Once, when acting on the instructions of 
Devadatta, the royal mahouts let loose NÄlÄgiri, maddened with drink, on the 
Buddhaâ€™s path, so that he might trample the Buddha to death, Ä€nanda, seeing the 
animal rushing towards them, immediately took his stand in front of the Buddha. 
Three times the Buddha forbade him to do so, but Ä€nanda, usually most obedient, 
refused to move, and it is said that the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the 
earth roll back in order to get Ä€nanda out of the elephantâ€™s path. [J.v.335-6; 
it was in this connection that the CÅ«lahamsa JÄtaka was preached to show that 
Ä€nanda had, in previous births also, renounced his life to save that of the 
Buddha; see also DhA.i.119. The Cullavagga account of the NÄlÄgiri incident 
makes no mention of Ä€nandaâ€™s past (Vin.ii.195)]. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the extreme zealousness of 
Ä€nanda drew on him the Buddhaâ€™s rebuke â€” e.g., when he prepared tekatuka gruel 
(gruel with three kinds of pungent substances) for the Buddha when he was 
suffering from wind in the stomach. The gruel was prepared from food kept 
indoors and was cooked by Ä€nanda himself, indoors; this was against the rules 
(Vin.i.210-11), but Ä€nanda knew that the gruel would cure the Buddha.</p>
<p>Ä€nanda was most efficient in the 
performance of the numerous duties attached to his post. Whenever the Buddha 
wished to summon the monks or to send a message to anyone, it was to Ä€nanda that 
he entrusted the task. See, e.g., D.ii.199; 147; Vin.i.80; M.i.456.</p>
<p>He reported to the Buddha any news which 
he beard and thought interesting. E.g., the death of Nigantha NÄtaputta, of 
which he learnt from Cunda Samanuddesa (D.iii.118; M.ii.244); also Devadattaâ€™s 
conspiracy to harm the Buddha (Vin.ii.198).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Laymen and laywomen, wishing to give 
alms to the Buddha and the monks, would often consult him in their difficulties, 
and he would always advise them. E.g., the Andhakavinda BrÄhmana (Vin.i.220-1); 
Roja the Malla (ibid., 248); see also ibid., 238f.</p>
<p>When the monks came to him expressing 
their desire to hear the Buddha preach, he did his best to grant their wish. E.g„ 
when the Buddha retired into the PÄrileyya forest (S.iii.95; DhA.i.50f.).</p>
<p>Sometimes when Ä€nanda felt that an 
interview with the Buddha would be of use to certain people, he would contrive 
that the Buddha should talk to them and solve their doubts; thus, for instance, 
he arranged an interview for the Nigantha Saccaka (M.i.237) and the brahmins 
SangÄrava and Rammaka (S.i.163; M.i.161). Similarly he took Samiddhi to the 
Buddha when he found that Samiddhi had wrongly represented the Buddhaâ€™s views 
(M.iii.208). When he discovered that Kimbila and a large number of other monks 
would greatly benefit if the Buddha would preach to them on ÄnÄpÄnasati, he 
requested the Buddha that he should do so. (S.v.323). Ä€nandaâ€™s requests were, 
however, not always granted. Once, for instance, though he asked the Buddha 
three times to recite the PÄtimokkha, the Buddha refused to do so until an 
offending monk had been removed (Vin.ii.236f.).</p>
<p>Again, when at VesÄli, as a result of 
the Buddhaâ€™s talks to the monks on asubha, a large number of them, feeling shame 
and loathing for their bodies, committed suicide, Ä€nanda suggested to the Buddha 
that he might teach the monks some method by which they might obtain insight (aÃ±Ã±Ä) 
(S.v.320f).</p>
<p>In order that people might still worship 
the Buddha when he was away on tour, Ä€nanda planted the Ä€nanda-Bodhi (q.v.).</p>
<p>Ä€nanda was, however, careful that people 
should not weary the Buddha unnecessarily. Even when he told the Buddha about 
the suicide of the monks (mentioned above), he was careful to wait till the 
Buddha had finished his fortnightâ€™s solitude, because he had given orders that 
he should not be disturbed.</p>
<p>When Subhadda wanted to see the Buddha 
as he lay on his death-bed, Ä€nanda refused to let him in until expressly asked 
to do so by the Master (D.ii.149). That same day when the Mallas of KusinÄrÄ 
came with their families to pay their last respects to the Buddha, Ä€nanda 
arranged them in groups, and introduced each group so that the ceremony might be 
gone through without delay (D.ii.148).</p>
<p>He often saved the Buddha from 
unpleasantness by preventing too pious admirers from trying to persuade the 
Buddha to do what was against his scruples. E.g., BodhirÄjakumÄra, when he asked 
the Buddha to walk over the carpets in his mansion, Kokanada (Vin.ii.128; 
M.ii.94).</p>
<p>Among Ä€nandaâ€™s duties was the task of 
going round to put away anything which might have been forgotten by anyone in 
the congregation after hearing the Buddha preach (DhA.i.410).</p>
<p>Ä€nanda was often consulted by colleagues 
on their various difficulties. Thus we find VangÄ«sa (S.i.188; Thag.vers.1223-6) 
confiding to him his restlessness at the sight of women and asking for his 
advice. Among others who came to him with questions on various doctrinal matters 
were KÄmabhÅ« (S.iv.165-6), UdÄyi (S.v.166-8; A.iv.449), Channa (S.iii.133-4), 
and Bhadda (S.v.171-3; ThagA.i.474; he could not, however, be of use to his 
fellow celibate Bhandu). Nor were these consultations confined to his 
fellow-monks, for we find the brahmins Ghosita (S.iv.113) and UnnÄbha (S.v.272), 
the Licchavis Abhaya and PanditakumÄraka (A.i.220), the paribbÄjakas Channa 
(A.i.215) and Kokanuda (A.v.196), the upÄsikÄ MigasÄlÄ (A.iii.347, and again 
A.v.137), a householder of KosambÄ« (A.i.217) and Pasenadi Kosala (M.ii.112), all 
coming to him for enlightenment and instruction. It was on this occasion that 
Pasenadi presented Ä€nanda with a valuable piece of foreign material which had 
been sent to him by AjÄtasattu. </p>
<p>Sometimes the monks, having heard a 
brief sermon from the Buddha, would seek out Ä€nanda to obtain from him a more 
detailed exposition, for he had the reputation of being able to expound the 
Dhamma (A.v.225; S.iv.93).</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha would often 
deliberately shorten his discourse to the monks so that they might be tempted to 
have it further explained by Ä€nanda. They would then return to the Buddha and 
report to him Ä€nandaâ€™s exposition, which would give him an opportunity of 
praising Ä€nandaâ€™s erudition. MA.i.81; for such praise see, e.g., A.v.229. It is 
said that once when a certain landowner asked the Buddha how he could show 
honour to the Dhamma, the Buddha told him to show honour to Ä€nanda if he wished 
to honour the Dhamma (J.iv.369). </p>
<p>In the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff ) we are 
told that after the Buddha had preached to the SÄkiyans of Kapilavatthu till late 
at night, he asked Ä€nanda to continue the discourse while he himself rested. 
Ä€nanda did so, and when the Buddha awoke after his sleep, he commended Ä€nanda on 
his ability. On another occasion, the Buddha asks Ä€nanda to address the monks on 
the wonders attendant on a Buddhaâ€™s birth, and the Acchari-yabbhuta-Dhamma Sutta 
is the result. The Buddha is mentioned as listening with approval (M.iii.119ff).</p>
<p>Sometimes Ä€nanda would suggest to the 
Buddha a simile to be used in his discourse, e.g. the DhammayÄna simile (S.v.5); 
or by a simile suggest a name to be given to a discourse, e.g. the Madhupindika 
Sutta (M.i.114; cp. UpavÄna suggesting the name for the PÄsÄdika Sutta 
D.iii.141); or again, particularly wishing to remember a certain Sutta, he would 
ask the Buddha to give it a name, e.g. the BahudhÄtuka Sutta (M.iii.67).</p>
<p>Several instances occur of Ä€nanda 
preaching to the monks of his own accord (E.g., A.ii.156f.; v.6) and also to the 
laity (E.g., A.ii.194). The Sandaka Sutta records a visit paid by Ä€nanda with 
his followers to the paribbajaka Sandaka, and describes how he won Sandaka over 
by a discourse. Sometimes, as in the case of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189f 
) Ä€nanda would repeat to the assembly of monks a sermon which he had previously 
heard the Buddha preach. Ä€nanda took the fullest advantage of the permission 
granted to him by the Buddha of asking him any question he desired. He had a 
very inquiring mind; if the Buddha smiled he would ask the reason (M.ii.45, 50, 
74; A.iii.214f.; J.iii.405; iv.7).</p>
<p>Or if he remained silent, Ä€nanda had to 
be told the reason (S.iv.400). He knew that the Buddha did nothing without 
definite cause; when UpavÄna, who stood fanning the Buddha, was asked to move 
away, Ä€nanda wished to know the reason, and was told that UpavÄna prevented 
various spirits from seeing the Buddha (D.ii.139). The Buddha was always willing 
to answer Ä€nandaâ€™s questions to his satisfaction. Sometimes, as in the case of 
his question regarding the dead citizens of Ã‘ÄtikÄ (D.ii.91ff.),* a long 
discourse would result.**</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* In this case the discourse concluded 
  with a description of the DhammÄdÄsa (Mirror of Truth) to be used for all 
  time; see also S.v.356-60.</p>
  <p>** The PabbajjÄ Sutta (Sn.72ff.), was 
  preached because of Ä€nandaâ€™s request that the Buddha should give an account of 
  his renunciation (SnA.ii.381); see also PubbayogÄvacara Sutta (SnA.i.47).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most often his consultations with the 
Buddha were on matters of doctrine or were connected with it â€” e.g., on nirodha 
(S.iii.24); loka (S.iv.53); suÃ±Ã±a (S.iv.54; M.iii.104-24); vedanÄ (S.iv.219-21) 
; iddhi (S.v.282-4; 286); ÄnÄpÄnasati (S.v.328-34); bhava, etc. (A.i.223f.); on 
the chalabhijÄti of PÅ«rana Kassapa (q.v.); the aims and purposes of sÄ«la 
(A.v.1f., repeated in v.311f.); the possibilities of samÄdhi (A.v.7f., repeated 
in v.318 and in A.i.132f.); on sanghabheda (A.v.75ff.); the qualities requisite 
to be a counsellor of monks (A.iv.279ff.); the power of carrying possessed by a 
Buddhaâ€™s voice (A.i.226f.); the conditions necessary for a monkâ€™s happiness 
(A.iii.132f.); the different ways of mastering the elements (M.iii.62f.); the 
birthplace of â€œnoble menâ€ (DhA.iii.248); and the manner in which previous 
Buddhas kept the Fast-day (DhA.iii.246). To these should be added the 
conversations on numerous topics recorded in the MahÄparinibbÄna Sutta. Some of 
these questions â€” e.g., about earthquakes (D.ii.107ff.; A.iv.312ff.) and the 
different kinds of spirits present at the death of the Buddha (D.ii.139f.) â€” 
seem to have been put into Ä€nandaâ€™s mouth in order that they might be used as 
pegs on which to hang beliefs connected with them which were current among 
later-day Buddhists.</p>
<p>Not all the Suttas addressed to Ä€nanda 
are, however, the result of his questions. Sometimes he would repeat to the 
Buddha conversations he had had with others and talks he had overheard, and the 
Buddha would expound in detail the topics occurring therein.</p>
<p>Thus, for instance, a conversation with 
Pasenadi Kosala on KalyÄnamittatÄ is repeated and the Buddha explains its 
importance (S.i.87-9; v.2-3) ; Ä€nanda tells the Buddha about his visit to the 
ParibbajakÄrÄma in Kosambi and what he there heard about a bhikkhu being called 
niddasa after twelve years of celibacy. The Buddha thereupon expounds the seven 
niddasavatthu (A.iv.37ff.). The account conveyed by Ä€nanda of UdÄyÄ« preaching to 
a large crowd leads to an exposition of the difficulties of addressing large 
assemblies and the qualities needed to please them (A.iii.184). A conversation 
between UdÄyÄ« and the carpenter PaÃ±cakanga on feelings is overheard by Ä€nanda 
and reported to the Buddha, who gives a detailed explanation of his views on the 
subject (S.iv.222f.; M.i.397f.). The same thing happens when Ä€nanda mentions to 
the Buddha talks he had heard between SÄriputta and the PÄribbÄjakas (S.ii.35-7) 
and between the same Elder and BhÅ«miya (S.ii.39-41). Sometimes â€” as in the case 
of the upÄsikÄ MigasÄlÄ (A.iii.347; v.137) â€” Ä€nanda would answer questions put 
to him as best he could, and seek the Buddhaâ€™s advice and corrections of his 
interpretation of the Doctrine.</p>
<p>When the monks asked Ä€nanda whether the 
Buddhaâ€™s predictions regarding the results of Devadattaâ€™s crimes were based on 
actual knowledge, he furnished them with no answer at all until he had consulted 
the Buddha (A.iii.402). Similarly, when Tapussa questions him as to why 
household life is not attractive to laymen, Ä€nanda takes him straight away to 
the Buddha, who is spending his siesta in the MahÄvana in Uruvelakappa 
(A.iv.438f.). Once Ä€nanda fancies that he knows all about causation, and tells 
the Buddha how glad he is that he should understand this difficult subject. The 
Buddha points out to him that he really knows very little about it and preaches 
to him the MahÄnidÄna Sutta (D.ii.55ff.; S.ii.92-3).</p>
<p>When Ä€nanda realises that the Buddha 
will die in a short while, with childlike simplicity, he requests the Buddha to 
make a last pronouncement regarding the Order (D.ii<st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=".98 ff">.98 
ff</st2:frenchfranctoeuro>.; S.v.152-4).</p>
<p>On several occasions it is news that 
Ä€nanda brings to the Buddha â€” e.g., about the death of the Nigantha NÄtaputta, 
and about Devadattaâ€™s plots, already mentioned â€” which provoke the Buddha to 
preach to him: Phagguna has died, and at his death his senses seemed very clear; 
so they would, says the Buddha, and proceeds to speak of the advantages of 
listening to the Dhamma in due season (A.iii.381f.). Or again, GirimÄnanda is 
ill and would the Buddha go and see him? The Buddha suggests that Ä€nanda should 
go and tell GirimÄnanda about the ten kinds of saÃ±Ã±Ä (aniccasÃ±Ã±Ä, etc.), and the 
patient will recover (A.v.108f.). Ä€nanda desires to retire into solitude and 
develop zeal and energy; would the Buddha tell him on which topics to meditate? 
And the Buddha preaches to him the doctrine of impermanence (S.iii.187; 
iv.54-5).</p>
<p>The Buddha, however, often preached to 
Ä€nanda without any such provocation on various topics â€” e.g., on the nature of 
the sahkhÄra (S.iii.3740); on the impossibility of the monk without faith 
attaining eminence in the sÄsana (A.v.152ff.); on the power the Buddha has of 
knowing which doctrines would appeal to different people and of preaching 
accordingly (A.v.36f.); on immorality and its consequences (A.i.50f.); on the 
admonitions that should be addressed to new entrants to the Order (A.iii.138f.); 
on the advice which should be given to friends by those desiring their welfare 
(A.i.222).</p>
<p>The various topics on which the Buddha 
discoursed to Ä€nanda as recorded in the MahÄ ParinibbÄna Sutta, have already 
been referred to. Some of them â€” e.g., on the eight assemblies, the eight 
positions of mastery, the eight stages of deliverance (D.ii.112) â€” seem to be 
stereotyped later additions. On the other hand, with regard to the accounts of 
the honours to be paid to a Buddhaâ€™s dead body, the places of pilgrimage for the 
pious, and various other similar subjects, it is impossible to say how far they 
are authentic. In a few instances the remarks addressed to Ä€nanda seem to be 
meant for others, to be heard by them or to be conveyed to them â€” e.g., in the 
dispute between UdÄyÄ« and SÄriputta, when they both seek the Buddha for him to 
settle the differences in opinion between them (A.iii.192ff.); or, again, when 
the recalcitrant UdÄyÄ« fails to answer the Buddhaâ€™s question on subjects of 
reflection (anussatitthÄna), and Ä€nanda gives an answer which the Buddha 
approves (A.iii.322ff.). A question asked by Ä€nanda as to whether there are any 
scents which spread even against the wind, results in the well-known sermon 
about the fame of the holy man being wafted everywhere (A.i.222f.; 
DhA.i.420ff.). Once or twice Ä€nanda intervenes in a discussion between the 
Buddha and another, either to ask a question or to suggest a simile which he 
feels could help the Buddha in establishing his point â€” e.g., in the interviews 
of Uttiya ParibbÄjaka (A.v.194), of the brahmin SangÄrava (A.i.169), and again 
of VidÅ«dabha, son of Pasenadi (M.ii.130).</p>
<p>In the MahÄ MÄlunkyÄ Sutta (M.i.433), it 
is Ä€nandaâ€™s intervention which evokes the discourse on the Five Fetters. 
Similarly he intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and PÄrÄsariyaâ€™s 
pupil, Uttara, and persuades the Buddha to preach the IndriyabhÄvanÄ Sutta on 
the cultivation of the Faculties (M.iii.298ff.).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa gives a list of the 
discourses which bring out the eminence and skill of Ä€nanda; they are the Sekha, 
BÄhitiya, Ä€naÃ±jasappÄya, Gopaka-MoggallÄna, BahudhÄtuka, CÅ«lasuÃ±Ã±ata, 
MahÄsuÃ±Ã±ata, Acchariyabbhuta, Bhaddekaratta, MahÄnidÄ-na, MahÄparinibbÄna, Subha 
and CÅ«laniyalokadhÄtu. (For particulars of these see under the respective 
names.) The books give accounts of several conversations between Ä€nanda and his 
eminent colleagues, such as SÄriputta. See also his conversation with MusÄ«la, 
and Savittha and NÄrada at KosambÄ« in the GhositÄrÄma (S.ii.113f.). He seems to 
have felt happy in their company and did not hesitate to take to them his 
difficulties; thus we find him asking SÄriputta why only certain beings in this 
world reach parinibbÄna (A.ii.167); on another occasion he asks SÄriputta about 
the possibilities of samÄdhi (A.v.8). On the other hand, at least twice 
(A.iii.201f.; 361f.), when Ä€nanda asks his questions of SÄriputta, the latter 
suggests that Ä€nanda himself should find the answer, and having heard it, 
SÄriputta praises him highly and extols his abilities.</p>
<p>Ä€nandaâ€™s special friends seem to have 
been SÄriputta, MoggallÄna, MahÄ Kassapa, Anuruddha and KankhÄ Revata (E.g., 
M.i.212f). He was the Sangha-navaka among them all, yet they held him in high 
esteem (MA.i.436). Ä€nanda and SÄriputta were very special friends. It is said 
that SÄriputta loved Ä€nanda because the latter did for the Buddha what SÄriputta 
would wish to have done himself, and Ä€nanda respected SÄriputta because he was 
the Buddhaâ€™s chief disciple. Young men who were ordained by either of them would 
be sent to the other to learn under him. They shared between them any good thing 
given to them. Once Ä€nanda was presented by a brahmin with a costly robe; 
immediately he wished to give it to SÄriputta, but as the latter was away at the 
time, he obtained the Buddhaâ€™s permission to keep it for him till his return 
(Vin.i.289; Sp.iii.636-7; MA.i.436).</p>
<p>The Samyutta NikÄya (i.63-4) contains an 
eulogy on SÄriputta by Ä€nanda, where the latter speaks of his comprehensive and 
manifold wisdom, joyous and swift, of his rampant energy and readiness to accept 
advice. When he hears of SÄriputtaâ€™s death from Cunda the Samanuddesa, he goes 
to the Buddha with Cunda (not wishing to break the news himself) and they take 
with them SÄriputtaâ€™s bowl and outer robe, Cunda carrying the ashes, and there 
Ä€nanda confesses to the Buddha that when he heard the news he felt as thought 
his body were drugged, his senses confused and his mind become a blank (S.v.161; 
Thag.vers.1034-5). The Commentary adds (SA.i.180) that Ä€nanda was trembling 
â€œlike a cock escaping from the mouth of a cat.â€</p>
<p>That MahÄ Kassapa was fond of Ä€nanda, we 
may gather from the fact that it was he who contrived to have him elected on the 
First Council, and when MahÄ Kassapa heard of Ä€nandaâ€™s attainment of 
arahantship, it was he who led the applause (DA.i.11). Ä€nanda held him in the 
highest veneration, and on one occasion refused to take part in an upasampadÄ 
ordination because he would have to pronounce Kassapaâ€™s name and did not 
consider this respectful towards the Elder (Vin.i.92). In their conversations, 
Kassapa addresses Ä€nanda as â€œÄvusoâ€, Ä€nanda addresses Kassapa as â€œbhante.â€ There 
is an interview recorded between them in which Kassapa roundly abuses Ä€nanda, 
calling him- corn-tramplerâ€ and â€œdespoiler of families,â€ and he ends by up 
saying , this boy does not know his own measure.â€ Ä€nanda had been touring 
Dahkhinagiri with a large company of monks, mostly youths, and the latter had 
not brought much credit upon them selves. When Kassapa sees Ä€nanda on his return 
to RÄjagaha, he puts on him the whole blame for the youths' want of training. 
Ä€nanda winces at being called â€œboyâ€; , my head is growing grey hairs, your 
reverence, yet I am not vexed that you should call me 'boy' even at this time of 
day.â€ ThullanandÄ heard of this incident and showed great annoyance. â€œHow dare 
MahÄ Kassapa,â€ she says, â€œwho was once a heretical teacher, chide the sage 
Ä€nanda, calling him 'boy'?â€ MahÄ Kassapa complains to Ä€nanda of ThullanandÄâ€™s 
behaviour; probably, though we are not told so, Ä€nanda apologised to him on her 
behalf (S.ii.217ff).</p>
<p>On another occasion, Ä€nanda, after a 
great deal of persuasion, took Kassapa to a settlement of the nuns. There 
Kassapa preached to them, but the nun ThullatissÄ was not pleased and gave vent 
publicly to her displeasure. â€œHow does Kassapa think it fit to preach the 
doctrine in the presence of the learned sage Ä€nanda? It is as if the needle-pedlar 
were to deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker.â€ Kassapa is incensed at 
these words, but Ä€nanda appeases him by acknowledging that he (Kassapa) is in 
every way his superior and asks him to pardon Tissa. â€œBe indulgent, your 
reverence,â€ says he, â€œwomen are foolish.â€ S.ii.215ff.; the Tibetans say that 
when Kassapa died, AjÄtasattu was very grieved because he had not been able to 
see the monkâ€™s body. Ä€nanda took the king to the mountain where it had been 
buried and showed it to him (Rockhill, op. cit., p.162 and n.2).</p>
<p>In this passage Ä€nanda is spoken of as 
Vedehamuni. The Commentary (SA.ii.132) explains it by panditamuni, and says 
further, pandito hi Ã±ÄnasankhÄtena vedena Ä«hati sabbakiccÄni karoti, tasmÄ 
vedeho ti vuccati ; vedeho ca so muni cÄ ti vedehamuni. Compare with this the 
derivation of Vedehiputta in connection with AjÄtasattu. See also VedehikÄ. The 
Mtu. (iii.176-7) says that when the Buddha went away from home Ä€nanda wished to 
join him, but his mother was unwilling, because his brother, Devadatta, had 
already gone away. Ä€nanda therefore went to the Videha country and became a muni. 
Is this another explanation of the term Vedehamuni?</p>
<p>It was perhaps Ä€nandaâ€™s championship of 
the womenâ€™s cause which made him popular with the nuns and earned for him a 
reputation rivalling, as was mentioned above, even that of MahÄ Kassapa. When 
PajÄpatÄ« GotamÄ«, with a number of SÄkyan women, undaunted by the Buddhaâ€™s 
refusal of their request at Kapilavatthu, followed him into VesÄli and there 
beseeched his consent for women to enter the Order, the Buddha would not change 
his mind.</p>
<p>Ä€nanda found the women dejected and 
weeping, with swollen feet, standing outside the KÅ«tÄgÄrasÄlÄ. Having learnt 
what had happened, he asked the Buddha to grant their request. Three times he 
asked and three times the Buddha refused. Then he changed his tactics. He 
inquired of the Buddha if women were at all capable of attaining the Fruits of 
the Path. The answer was in the affirmative, and Ä€nanda pushed home the 
advantage thus gained. In the end the Buddha allowed women to enter the Order 
subject to certain conditions. They expressed their great gratitude to Ä€nanda 
(Vin.ii.253ff. Ä€nanda is again found as intermediary for PajÄpatÄ« GotamÄ« in 
M.iii.253f). In this connection, the Buddha is reported as having said 
(Vin.ii.256) that had Ä€nanda not persuaded him to give his consent to the 
admission of women to the Order, the SÄsana would have lasted a thousand years, 
but now it would last only five hundred.</p>
<p>This championing of the womenâ€™s cause 
was also one of the charges brought against Ä€nanda by his colleagues at the end 
of the First Council. (See below.)</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this solicitude for their 
privileges that prompted him to ask the Buddha one day why it was that women did 
not sit in public assemblies (e.g. courts of justice), or embark on business, or 
reap the full fruit of their actions (A.ii.82. See also GS.ii.92, n.2, on the 
interpretation of the last word).</p>
<p>That Ä€nanda was in the habit of 
preaching frequently to the nuns is evident from the incidents quoted above and 
also from other passages (E.g., S.v.154ff.; Thag.v.1020; ThagA.ii.129). He seems 
also to have been in charge of the arrangements for sending preachers regularly 
to the nuns. A passage in the Samyutta Commentary (i.210) seems to indicate that 
Ä€nanda was a popular preacher among laywomen as well.</p>
<p>They would stand round him when he 
preached, fanning him and asking him questions on the Dhamma. When he went to 
KosambÄ« to impose the higher penalty on Channa, the women of King Udenaâ€™s harem, 
hearing of his presence in the park, came to him and listened to his preaching. 
So impressed were they that they gave him five hundred robes (Vin.ii.290). It 
was on this occasion that Ä€nanda convinced Udena of the conscientiousness with 
which the SÄkyaputta monks used everything which was given to them, wasting 
nothing. The king, pleased with Ä€nanda, gave him another five hundred robes, all 
of which he distributed among the community. </p>
<p>Ä€nanda had been a tailor in a past birth 
and had given a Pacceka Buddha a piece of cloth, the size of his hand, and a 
needle. Because of the gift of the needle he was wise, because of the cloth he 
got 500 robes (AA.i.239).</p>
<p>A similar story is related of the women 
of Pasenadiâ€™s palace and their gift to Ä€nanda. The king was at first angry, but 
afterwards gave Ä€nanda one thousand robes (J.ii.24ff).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.382ff ) 
says that once Pasenadi asked the Buddha to go regularly to the palace with five 
hundred monks and preach the Law to his queens MallikÄ and VÄsabhakhattiyÄ and 
to the other women in the palace. When the Buddha said that it was impossible 
for him to go regularly to one place he was asked to send a monk, and the duty 
was assigned to Ä€nanda. He therefore went to the palace at stated times and 
instructed the queens. MallikÄ was found to be a good student, but not so 
VÄsabhakhattiyÄ.</p>
<p>The JÄtaka Commentary (i.382) says that 
the women of the palace were themselves asked which of the eighty chief 
disciples they would have as their preacher and they unanimously chose Ä€nanda. 
For an incident connected with Ä€nandaâ€™s visits to the palace see the MahÄsÄra 
JÄtaka and also Pasenadi.</p>
<p>According to the Anguttara Commentary 
(ii.533) Ä€nanda was beautiful to look at.</p>
<p>Ä€nandaâ€™s services seem often to have 
been sought for consoling the sick. Thus we find AnÄthapindika sending for him 
when he lay ill (M.iii.258), and also Sirivaddha (S.v.176f) and MÄnadinna 
(S.v.177f). He is elsewhere mentioned as helping the Buddha to wait on a sick 
monk (Vin.i.302). We are told that when the Buddha had his afternoon siesta, 
Ä€nanda would spend his time in waiting upon the sick and talking to them 
(Sp.iii.651). Ä€nanda was never too busy to show gratitude to his friends. When a 
certain crow-keeperâ€™s family, members of which had been of special service to 
him, had been destroyed by a pestilence, leaving only two very young boys, he 
obtained the Buddhaâ€™s special permission to ordain them and look after them, 
though they were under the requisite age. (Vin.i.79; to a young monk who used to 
wait on him and do various services for him, Ä€nanda gave five hundred robes 
presented to him by Pasenadi; the monk distributed them to his colleagues).</p>
<p>When Ä€nanda discovered that his friend 
Roja and Malla had no real faith in the Buddha, he was greatly grieved and 
interceded on his special behalf with the Buddha that he should make Roja a 
believer. Later he obtained the Buddhaâ€™s permission for Roja to offer a meal of 
potherbs (Vin.i.247-9). In another place we find Roja presenting Ä€nanda with a 
linen cloth (Vin.i.296). According to the JÄtakatthakathÄ (ii.231) Roja once 
tried to persuade Ä€nanda to go back to the lay-life.</p>
<p>His sympathy is also shown in the story 
of the woman who asked to have a share in the VihÄra built by VisÄkhÄ. She 
brought a costly carpet, but could find no place in which to put it; it looked 
so poor beside the other furnishings. Ä€nanda helped her in her disappointment 
(DhA.i.415f).</p>
<p>Once in Jetavana, in an assembly of 
monks, the Buddha spoke the praises of Ä€nanda, and ranked him the foremost 
bhikkhu in five respects: erudition, good behaviour (gatimantÄnam, power of 
walking, according to DhammapÄla), retentive memory, resoluteness and personal 
attention (A.i.24f). Again, shortly before the Buddhaâ€™s death, he speaks 
affectionately of Ä€nanda (D.ii.144-5; A.ii.132; A.v.229; SA.ii.94f ); Ä€nanda 
knew the right time to bring visitors to the TathÄgata; he had four exceptional 
qualities, in that whoever came to see him, monks or nuns, laymen or laywomen, 
they were all filled with joy on beholding him; when he preached to them they 
listened with rapture and delight, which never tired. He was called Ä€nanda 
because he brought joy to his kinsmen (ThagA.ii.123).</p>
<p>But see the story of Atula 
(DhA.iii.327), who is not satisfied with Ä€nandaâ€™s preaching.</p>
<p>Another proof of the Buddhaâ€™s esteem for 
Ä€nanda is the incident of his asking Ä€nanda to design a robe for the monks to be 
in pattern like a field in Magadha (Vin.i.287).</p>
<p>In spite of Ä€nanda having been the 
constant companion of the Buddha â€” probably because of that very fact â€” it was 
not until after the Buddhaâ€™s parinibbÄna that Ä€nanda was able to realise 
Arahantship. Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Ä€nandaâ€™s struggle for final 
emancipation (DA.i.9ff.); see also Vin.ii.286. Though he was not an arahant he 
had the patisambhidÄ, being among the few who possessed this qualification while 
yet learners (SekhÄ) ( VibhA.388). When it was decided by MahÄ Kassapa and 
others that a Convocation should be held to systematise the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, 
five hundred monks were chosen as delegates, among them, Ä€nanda. He was, 
however, the only non-arahant (sekha) among them, and he had been enjoined by 
his colleagues to put forth great effort and repair this disqualification. At 
length, when the convocation assembled, a vacant seat had to be left for him. It 
had not been until late the previous night that, after a final supreme effort, 
he had attained the goal. He had been occupied in consoling the laity after the 
Buddhaâ€™s death and had had no time for practising meditation. In the end it was 
a devatÄ in the woodland grove in Kosala, where he was staying, who pointed out 
the urgency of the matter (S.i.199-200); but see ThagA.i.237, where the credit 
for this is given to a Vajjiputta thera.</p>
<p>It is said that he won sixfold abhiÃ±Ã±Ä 
when he was just lying down to sleep, his head hardly on the pillow, his feet 
hardly off the ground. He is therefore described as having become an arahant in 
none of the four postures. When he appeared in the convocation, MahÄ Kassapa 
welcomed him warmly and shouted three times for joy. According to the 
MajjhimabhÄnakÄ, says Buddhaghosa, Ä€nanda appeared on his seat while the others 
looked on, having come through the earth; according to others he came through 
the air. According to ThagA.ii.130, it was a BrahmÄ of the SuddhÄvÄsa who 
announced Ä€nandaâ€™s attainment of arahantship to his colleagues at the 
Convocation. </p>
<p>In the convocation, Ä€nanda was appointed 
to answer MahÄ Kassapaâ€™s questions, and to co-operate with him in rehearsing the 
Dhamma (as opposed to the Vinaya).</p>
<p>Ä€nanda came to be known as 
DhammabhandÄgÄrika, owing to his skill in remembering the word of the Buddha; it 
is said that he could remember everything spoken by the Buddha, from one to 
sixty thousand words in the right order; and without missing one single syllable 
(ThagA.ii.134).</p>
<p>In the first four NikÄyas of the Sutta 
Pitaka, every sutta begins with the words â€œThus have I heard,â€ the â€œIâ€ referring 
to Ä€nanda. It is not stated that Ä€nanda was present at the preaching by the 
Buddha of every sutta, though he was present at most; others, the Buddha 
repeated to him afterwards, in accordance with the conditions under which he had 
become the Buddhaâ€™s attendant.</p>
<p>We are told that Ä€nanda had learnt 
eighty-two thousand dhamma (topics) from the Buddha himself and two thousand 
from his colleagues (Thag.v.1024). He had also a reputation for fast talking; 
where an ordinary man could speak one word Ä€nanda could speak eight; the Buddha 
could speak sixteen words for each one word of Ä€nanda (MA.i.283). Ä€nanda could 
remember anything he had once heard up to fifteen thousand stanzas of sixty 
thousand lines (MA.i.501).</p>
<p>Ä€nanda lived to be very old (one hundred 
and twenty years, says DhA.ii.99; he is bracketed with Bakkula, as having lived 
to a great age, AA.ii.596); a hymn of praise sung at his death is included at 
the end of the stanzas attributed to him in the TheragÄthÄ (Vers.1047-9). That 
the Buddhaâ€™s death was a great blow to him is shown by the stanzas he uttered 
immediately after the event (D.ii.157). Three months earlier he had heard for 
the first time that death of the Buddha was near at hand and had besought him to 
live longer. The reply attributed to the Buddha is a curious one, namely, that 
on several previous occasions, at RÄjagaha and at VesÄlÄ« (See, e.g., D.102f), he 
had mentioned to Ä€nanda that he could, if he so desired, live for a whole kappa, 
and had hinted that Ä€nanda should, if he felt so inclined, request him to 
prolong his life. Ä€nanda, however, having failed to take the hint on these 
occasions, the opportunity was now past, and the Buddha must die; the fault was 
entirely Ä€nandaâ€™s (Ibid., 114-18). It was when Ä€nanda was temporarily absent 
from the Buddhaâ€™s side that the Buddha had assured MÄra that he would die in 
three months (Ibid., 105-6).</p>
<p>As the end approached, the Buddha 
noticed that Ä€nanda was not by his side; on enquiry he learnt that Ä€nanda was 
outside, weeping and filled with despair at the thought that the Master would 
soon be no more, and that he (Ä€nanda) would have to work out his perfection 
unaided. The Buddha sent for him and consoled him by pointing out that whatever 
is born must, by its very nature, be dissolved. Three times he said, â€œFor a long 
time, Ä€nanda, you have been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good, 
never varying, beyond all measure,â€ and he exhorted him to be earnest in effort, 
for he would soon realise emancipation. (Ibid., 144). It was on this occasion 
that the PalÄsa JÄtaka was preached (J.iii.23ff.).</p>
<p>Once, earlier, when UdÄyi had teased 
Ä€nanda for not having benefited from his close association with the personality 
of the Master, the Buddha had defended Ä€nanda, saying, â€œSay not so, UdÄyi; 
should he die without attaining perfect freedom from passion, by virtue of his 
piety, he would seven times win rule over the devas and seven times be King of 
JambudÄ«pa. Howbeit, in this very life shall Ä€nanda attain to NibbÄna. A.i.228.</p>
<p>Ä€nanda did his best to persuade the 
Buddha to die in one of the great cities, such as RÄjagaha or SÄvatthi, and not 
in KusinÄrÄ, the little wattle-and-daub town (as he called it) in the middle of 
the jungle. He was not satisfied until the Buddha had revealed to him the past 
history of KusinÄrÄ, how it had once been KusÄvatÄ«, the royal capital of the 
mighty MahÄ Sudassana (D.ii.146).</p>
<p>Just before the Buddha died, Ä€nanda was 
commissioned to inform the Mallas of the impending event, and after the Buddhaâ€™s 
death, Anuruddha entrusted him, with the help of the Mallas of KusinÄÄa, with 
all the arrangements for the funeral (D.ii.158ff). Ä€nanda had earlier 
(D.ii.141f) learnt from the Buddha how the remains of a TathÄgata should be 
treated, and now he was to benefit by the instruction.</p>
<p>At the end of the First Council, the 
duty of handing down unimpaired the Digha NikÄya through his disciples was 
entrusted to Ä€nanda (DA.i.15). He was also charged with the duty of conveying to 
Channa the news that the higher penalty (brahmadanda) had been inflicted on him 
by the Sangha. Ä€nanda had been deputed by the Buddha himself to carry out this, 
his last administrative act (D.ii.154), but Ä€nanda, not wishing to undertake the 
responsibility alone (knowing that Channa had a reputation for roughness), was 
granted a number of companions, with whom he visited Channa. The latter 
expressed repentance and was pardoned (Vin.ii.290-2). Perhaps it was because 
both the Buddha and Ä€nandaâ€™s colleagues knew of his power to settle disputes 
that he was chosen for this delicate task. See S.ii.235f., where the Buddha 
classes him with SÄriputta and MoggallÄna for his ability to settle disputes 
among the monks.</p>
<p>Ä€nandaâ€™s popularity, however, did not 
save him from the recriminations of his fellows for some of his actions, which, 
in their eyes, constituted offences. Thus he was charged (Vin.ii.288-9) with: 
(1) having failed to find out from the Buddha which were the lesser and minor 
precepts which the Sangha were allowed to revoke if they thought fit (See 
D.ii.154); (2) with having stepped on the Buddhaâ€™s rainy-season garment when 
sewing it; (3) with having allowed the Buddhaâ€™s body to be first saluted by 
women (not mentioned elsewhere, but see Rockhill, op. cit., p.154); (4) with 
having omitted to ask the Buddha to live on for the space of a kappa (D.ii.115); 
and (5) with having exerted himself to procure the admission of women into the 
Order (Vin.ii.253).</p>
<p>Ä€nandaâ€™s reply was that he himself saw 
no fault in any of these acts, but that he would confess them as faults out of 
faith in his colleagues.</p>
<p>On another occasion he was found fault 
with (1) for having gone into the village to beg for alms, clothed in his 
waist-cloth and nether garment (Vin.i.298); (2) for having worn light garments 
which were blown about by the wind (Vin.ii.136).</p>
<p>The last years of his life, Ä€nanda seems 
to have spent in teaching and preaching and in encouraging his younger 
colleagues. Among those who held discussions with him after the Buddhaâ€™s passing 
away are mentioned Dasama of the Atthakanagara (M.i.349f), Gopaka MoggallÄna 
(M.iii.7; Thag.ver.1024) and Subha Todeyyaputta (D.i.204ff).</p>
<p>The PÄli Canon makes no mention of 
Ä€nandaâ€™s death. Fa Hsien (Giles trans. 44. The story also occurs in 
DhA.ii.99ff., with several variations in detail), however, relates what was 
probably an old tradition. When Ä€nanda was on his way from Magadha to VesÄli, 
there to die, AjÄtasattu heard that he was coming, and, with his retinue, 
followed him up to the Rohini River. The chiefs of Vesali also heard the news 
and went out to meet him, and both parties reached the river banks. Ä€nanda, not 
wishing to incur the displeasure of either party, entered into the state of 
tejokasina in the middle of the river and his body went up in flames. His 
remains were divided into two portions, one for each party, and they built 
cetiyas for their enshrinement (See also Rockhill, op. cit., 165f).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Ä€nanda 
had been the son of Ä€nanda, King of HamsavatÄ«, and was therefore a step-brother 
of Padumuttara. His name was Sumana. King Ä€nanda allowed no one but himself to 
wait on the Buddha. Prince Sumana having quelled an insurrection of the frontier 
provinces, the king offered him a boon as reward, and he asked to be allowed to 
entertain the Buddha and his monks for three months. With great reluctance the 
king agreed, provided the Buddhaâ€™s consent was obtained. When Sumana went to the 
vihÄra to obtain this, he was greatly impressed by the loyalty and devotion of 
the Buddhaâ€™s personal attendant, the monk Sumana, and by his iddhi-powers. 
Having learnt from the Buddha that these were the result of good deeds, he 
himself determined to lead a pious life. For the Buddhaâ€™s residence Prince 
Sumana bought a pleasaunce named Sobhana from a householder of that same name 
and built therein a monastery costing one hundred thousand. On the way from the 
capital to Sobhana Park he built vihÄras, at distances of a league from each 
other. When all preparations were completed, the Buddha went to Sobhana with one 
hundred thousand monks, stopping at each vihÄra on the way. At the festival of 
dedication of the Sobhana VihÄra, Sumana expressed a wish to become a personal 
attendant of a future Buddha, just as Sumana was of Padumuttara. Towards this 
end he did many good deeds. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave his upper 
garment to a monk for him to carry his begging-bowl in it. Later he was born in 
heaven and again as King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He built for eight Pacceka Buddhas eight 
monasteries in his royal park (ThagA.ii.121ff) and for ten thousand years he 
looked after them. The ApadÄna mentions (i.52f) that he became ruler of heaven 
thirty-four times and king of men fifty-eight times.</p>

<p>He was King of Benares in the KÄka 
(i.486), the TacasÄra (iii.206) and the SankhapÄla (v.177); King Mallika in the 
RÄjovÄda (ii.5), the Kosala King in the Manikundala (iii.155), King Vanka in the 
Ghata (iii.170), the Kosavya King in the DhÅ«makÄri (iii.402), King AddhamÄsaka 
in the GangamÄla (iii.454), and King DhanaÃ±jaya in the Sambhava (v.67), and the 
Vidhurapandita (vi.329).</p>
<p>In the MahÄ NÄradakassapa JÄtaka 
(J.vi.255) Ä€nanda was born as RujÄ, daughter of King Angati.</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.327) states 
that once when Ä€nanda was a blacksmith he sinned with the wife of another man. 
As a result, he suffered in hell for a long time and was born for fourteen 
existences as some oneâ€™s wife, and it was seven existences more before the 
results of his evil deed were exhausted.</p>
<p>There seems to be some confusion as to 
the time at which Ä€nanda entered the Order. In the Canonical account (E.g., 
Vin.ii.182) he became a monk in the second year of the Buddhaâ€™s ministry. In the 
verses attributed to him in the TheragÄtha (Vers.1039ff), however, he says that 
he has been for twenty five years a learner (sekha). It is concluded from this 
that Ä€nanda must have joined the Order only in the twentieth year after the 
Enlightenment and the whole story of his having been ordained at the same time 
as Devadatta is discredited. (See, e.g., Thomas: op. cit., 123. See also Rhys 
Davids' article on Devadatta in ERE). The verses occur in a lament by Ä€nanda 
that his master is dead and that he is yet a learner. The twenty-five years 
which Ä€nanda mentions probably refer to the period during which he had been the 
Buddhaâ€™s personal attendant and not to his whole career as a monk. During that 
period, â€œthough he was but a learner, no thoughts of evil arose in him,â€ the 
implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to 
him gave no room for such. He, nevertheless, laments that he could not become an 
asekha while the Buddha was yet alive. If this interpretation be accepted â€” and 
I see no reason why it should not be â€” there is no discrepancy in the accounts 
of Ä€nandaâ€™s ordination.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ä€nanda.</b>-A Khattiya king of Hamsavati, 
father of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xii.19). He had, by another wife, a 
daughter NandÄ, who became the therÄ« PakulÄ in the present age (ThigA.91). Once, 
with twenty of his ministers and twenty thousand of his subjects, he appeared 
before Padumuttara Buddha at MithilÄ and, having received the â€œehi-bhikkhu-pabbajjÄ,â€ 
they became arahants (MA.ii.722; DA.ii.488). The Buddha went back with them to 
HamsavatÄ« where he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.160).</p>
<p>One of Ä€nandaâ€™s sons was the prince 
Sumana, step-brother to Padumuttara, who became Ä€nanda, the personal attendant 
of Gotama Buddha. ThagA.ii.122.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ä€nanda.</b>-Step-brother of Mangala 
Buddha. He came to Mangala Buddha with ninety crores of followers; having heard 
the Buddhaâ€™s preaching, they all became arahants. J.i.30.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Ä€nanda.</b>-Son of Tissa Buddha, his 
mother being SubhaddÄ. Bu.xviii.18.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Ä€nanda.</b>-Son of Phussa Buddha, his 
mother being KisÄgotami (Bu.xix.16). The Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.192), 
however, gives his name as Anupama.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Ä€nanda.</b>-A Pacceka Buddha of 
ninety-one kappas ago. The thera CitakapÅ«jaka, in a previous birth, came down 
from the deva-loka and cremated the Pacceka Buddhaâ€™s body with due honour 
(Ap.i.227). According to the Majjhima NikÄya and its Commentary (M.iii.70; 
MA.ii.890), there were four Pacceka Buddhas of this name.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Ä€nanda.</b>-A king of vultures. He dwelt 
with ten thousand vultures in GijjhakÅ«ta and came to hear KunÄla preach. At the 
end of KunÄlaâ€™s sermon Ä€nanda, too, discoursed in the same strain, dwelling on 
the evil qualities of women â€œkeeping to facts within his knowledgeâ€ (J.v.424, 
447-50). He lived in the KunÄladaha with NÄrada, Devala, Punnamukha, the cuckoo, 
and KunÄla (SnA.i.359). In the present age the vulture-king was Ä€nanda Thera, 
the Buddhaâ€™s attendant (J.v.456).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Ä€nanda.</b>-A king of fishes, appointed 
by the fishes themselves to rule over them (J.i.207; ii.352). He was one of the 
six monsters of the deep. He lived on one side of the ocean and all the fishes 
came to him morning and evening to pay their respects. He lived on rock-slime (sevÄla) 
till one day he swallowed, by mistake, a fish. Liking the taste very much, be 
found out what it was, and from that day he ate fish, unknown to his subjects. 
Seeing their numbers diminish, they began to grow inquisitive, and one day one 
of their wise ones hid in the lobe of Ä€nandaâ€™s ear and discovered him eating the 
fish which straggled behind. When this was reported to the other fish, they fled 
in terror and hid themselves. Ä€nanda, desirous of eating them, searched 
everywhere; believing that they lay inside a mountain, he encircled it with his 
body. Seeing his own tail on the other side of the mountain and believing it to 
be a fish trying to escape, he crunched it in a rage. The tail was fifty leagues 
long and he suffered excruciating pain. Attracted by the smell of blood, the 
fish collected round and ate him bit by bit. His skeleton was as big as a 
mountain, and holy ascetics, flying through the air and seeing it below them, 
told men about it and the story became famous throughout JambudÄ«pa. KÄlahatthi 
is reported as relating this story to the king in the MahÄ Sutasoma JÄtaka 
(J.v.462-4). Ä€nanda is referred to as an example of great deceitfulness. 
MA.i.138.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Ä€nanda.</b> A yakkha to whom a shrine, 
called the Ä€nanda Cetiya, was dedicated. The Cetiya was in Bhoganagara and was 
later converted into a Buddhist VihÄra (AA.ii.550). There the Buddha stayed 
during his last sojourn, and mention is made of a sermon he preached there to 
the monks on the Four Great Authorities (cattÄro mahÄpadesÄ) (D.ii.123-6; 
A.ii.167). From there he went to PÄvÄ.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Ä€nanda</b>.-A banker of SÄvatthi. He had 
eighty crores of money, but was a great miser. He had a son, MÅ«lasiri, and once 
a fortnight he would gather his kinsfolk together and, in their presence, 
admonish his son as to the desirability of amassing wealth, always increasing 
it, giving none away. When the banker died he was born in a CandÄla family 
outside the city gates. The king appointed MÅ«lasiri banker in his place. 
</p>
<p>From the time of Ä€nandaâ€™s conception 
among the CandÄlas, misfortune dogged their footsteps. Knowing that a Jonah had 
come among them, they caused a search to be made and, as a result of their 
investigations, they sent the pregnant mother away. When the child was born he 
was a monstrosity with his organs all out of place. When old enough, he was 
given a potsherd and told to beg his living. One day he came to the house in 
which he had lived in his former life, and though he managed to enter it, he was 
discovered and thrown out by the servants. The Buddha happened to be passing by, 
and sending for MÅ«lasiri, he told him that the beggar had been his father. Being 
convinced by certain proofs, MÅ«lasiri believed and took refuge in the Buddha 
(DhA.ii.25-8; the story is referred to in the MilindapaÃ±ha p.350). It is said 
that eighty-four thousand beings attained deathlessness on the occasion of the 
Buddha preaching to MÅ«lasiri about his father Ä€nanda. AA.i.57.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="11">11</a>. Ä€nanda.</b>-Author of the MÅ«latikÄ on 
Buddhaghosaâ€™s Commentaries on the Abhidhamma (Gv.60, 69; Sas.69). He was 
originally a native of India, but came over to Ceylon and became head of the 
VanavÄsi fraternity in the Island. He probably lived about the eighth or ninth 
century A.D. and wrote the MÅ«latikÄ at the request of a monk named Buddhamitta. 
He is probably identical with Ä€nanda, teacher of Culla DhammapÄla (see below) 
(P.L.C.202f.; 216f). He was also known as Vanaratana Tissa from his connection 
with the VanavÄsi school.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Ä€nanda.</b>-Teacher of Culla DhammapÄla, 
author of the Saccasankhepa. The Saddhamma Sanghala (ix) says that Ä€nanda was 
the author of the Saccasankhepa. See also above (Ä€nanda 11).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Ä€nanda.</b>-Teacher of Buddhappiya, 
author of the RÅ«pasiddhi. He was a native of Ceylon, for Buddhapiya refers to 
him as â€œTambapannid-dhaja.â€ He too belonged to the VanavÄsi sect and wrote a 
Sinhalese interverbal translation to Piyadassiâ€™s Pada-SÄdhana and another to the 
Khudda-SikkhÄ. He was a disciple of Udumbaragiri Medhankara, pupil of SÄriputta, 
and he probably lived in the time of VijayabÄhu III. (P.L.C. 211).</p>
<p>He was the teacher of Vedeha, author of 
the SamantakÅ«avannanÄ (P.L.C. 220). See also Buddhavamsa Vanaratana Ä€nanda.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>14. Ä€nanda.</b>-Author of the SaddhammopÄyana, also called Abhayagiri-Kavicakravarti Ä€nanda and probably 
belonging to the same period as Ä€nanda (13). His friend and companion, for whom 
his book was written, was Buddhasoma. An Ä€nanda, probably a later writer, is 
also the author of a Sinhalese Commentary on the SaddhammopÄyana. P.L.C.212.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>15. Ä€nanda.</b>-Companion of Chapata and 
co-founder of the SÄ«hala-Sangha of Burma (SÄs.65). He was later cut off from the 
community for trying to send to his kinsfolk an elephant presented to him by 
King Narapati. His companions suggested that the animal should be let loose in 
the forest, in accordance with the Buddhaâ€™s teaching regarding kindness to 
animals. Ä€nandaâ€™s reply was that the Buddha had also preached kindness to 
kinsfolk (Bode: op. cit., 24). He died in 1246 (Forehammer: Jardine Prize Essay, 
p.35).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>16. Ä€nanda.</b>-Of HamsavatÄ«. Author of the 
MadhusÄratthadÄ«panÄ«, a tÄ«kÄ on the Abhidhamma. SÄs.48; but see Bode: op. cit., 
47-8.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>17. Ä€nanda.</b>-Called MÄnava, in order to 
distinguish him from others. He was a brahmin youth, maternal cousin of the 
therÄ« UppalavannÄ, with whom he had been in love when she was a laywoman. One 
day when UpalavannÄ returned from her alms-rounds to her hut in Andhavana, where 
she was living at the time, Ä€nandamÄnava, who was hiding under her bed, jumped 
up and seized her. In spite of her protestations and admonitions, he overcame 
her resistance by force and, having worked his will of her, went away. As if 
unable to endure his wickedness, the earth burst asunder and he was swallowed up 
in AvÄ«ci (DhA.ii.49-50).</p>
<p>In order that such assaults should not 
be repeated, Pasenadi Kosala erected, at the Buddhaâ€™s suggestion, a residence 
for the nuns within the city gates, and henceforth they lived only within the 
precincts of the city (DhA.ii.51f).</p>
