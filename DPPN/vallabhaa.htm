<p>A South Indian tribe. Their ruler is described in the 
Chronicles simply as the Vallabha. Mānavamma once joined Narasīha against the 
Vallabha king and defeated him (Cv.xlvii.15ff). On another occasion, the 
Vallabha king sent a force to subdue Nāgadīpa in the reign of Mahinda IV. The 
latter sent an army under the general Sena, defeated the Vallabhas and made a 
friendly treaty with them. Cv.liv.12ff.</p>
