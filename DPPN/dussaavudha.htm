  <h2>Dussāvudha</h2>

</ul>
<p>One of the four most effective weapons 
found in the world. It belonged to <a href="aalavaka.htm" title="aa/aalavaka.htm">Ālavaka</a>. If he threw it up into the sky, no 
rain would fall for twelve years; if he let it fall on the earth, all plants and 
trees would die and nothing would grow for twelve years; if he threw it into the 
sea, the sea would completely dry up; it could make Sineru crumble into pieces. 
Ālavaka hurled it at the Buddha, but it fell at the Buddha’s feet and remained 
there as a rug.  </p>
<p>It is also called Vatthāvudha, and was evidently made of cloth 
(SNA.i.225f).</p>
