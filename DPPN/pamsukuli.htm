<p>A sect of ascetics in Ceylon, whose particular observance 
was probably the use of rag robes (pamsukūla). Their early origin is not known, 
Mānavamma is said to have built for them a pāsāda in the Thūpārāma 
(Cv.xlvii.66). They also occupied the Rājamātika vihāra and enjoyed the special 
favour of both Aggabodhi V. and of Aggabodhi VII (Ibid., xlviii.4, 16, 73). 
Vajira, senāpati of Aggabodhi IX., built for them the Kacchavāla vihāra (Ibid., 
xlix.80). Sena I. established for them headquarters on the Arittha pabbata and 
also made special provision for them at Pulatthipura (Ibid., l.63, 76). 
</p>
<p>They seem to have originally belonged to the congregation 
of the Abhayagiri vihāra, and continued to do so up to the reign of Sena II., 
when they separated off and formed special groups (Ibid., li.52). Later, Sena 
Ilanga, general of Kassapa IV., built the Samuddagiri parivena, in the Mahā 
vihāra for their use, and it is said that he dispensed rice and clothing to the 
mothers of the Pamsukulikas (Ibid., Iii.21). </p>
<p>In the time of Udaya III. various officials of the court 
fled to the tapovana occupied by the Pamsukulikas, but were pursued thither by 
the king and his viceroy and beheaded. Incensed by this act, the Pamsukulikas 
left the tapovana, which stood on land granted by the king, and went to Rohana. 
The people rose in rebellion, and those who had perpetrated the crime in the 
tapovana visited the Pamsukulikas in Rohana, asked their forgiveness, and 
persuaded them to return (Ibid., Iiii.14ff., 21ff). Mahinda IV. also showed them 
great honour (Ibid., liv.18, 24f). We hear of them last in the reign of 
Vikkamabāhu II., when that king deprived them of their lands, and they, in 
anger, retired again to Rohana (Ibid., lxi.59f). Thenceforth we hear no more of 
the sect, and it probably ceased to exist.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.52f ) 
that, after the depredations of Candāla Tissa, when the religion was at a very 
low ebb, a discussion arose between the Pamsukulikas and the Dhammakathīkas as 
to which was the more important branch of the sāsana pariyatti or patipatti. The 
Pamsukulikas voted for patipatti, but were defeated by the others.</p>
