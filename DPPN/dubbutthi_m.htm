<p>A rich man of Mahelanagara. Once a 
debtor, hoping to harm him, invited Tissa Thera and 500 monks of Abhayuttara-Vihāra 
in Dubbutthi’s name on the day D. had a ploughing ceremony. When the monks 
arrived, D.’s wife prepared food and fed them. When D. discovered this he was 
full of gratitude to his debtor and tore up the promissory note. Ras.ii.166f.</p>
