<p><b>1. Anuruddha Sutta.</b>-Preached by 
Anuruddha Thera to Pañcakanga, the king’s carpenter, at Sāvatthi, on the 
conclusion of a meal given by him to the Elder and three others. It explains the 
two kinds of emancipation of mind, the “boundless” and the “vast,” and the 
results of developing them, which produce birth among the Brilliant Gods. 
 
</p>
<p>Abhiya-Kaccana, who was evidently one of Anuruddha’s companions on this 
occasion, asks him the reason for the difference in degree of the brilliance of 
the gods; he is answered to his satisfaction. M.iii.144-52.</p>

<hr>
<p><b><a name="5">5</a>. Anuruddha Sutta.</b>-On the eight 
thoughts of a great being (mahāpurisa vitakka).</p>
