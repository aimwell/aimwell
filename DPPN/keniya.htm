<p><b>1. Keniya (v.l. Kenniya).</b>-A Jatila. He 
lived in <a href="aapana.htm" title="aa/aapana.htm">Āpana</a>, and when the Buddha once stayed there with one thousand three 
hundred and fifty monks, Keniya visited the Buddha, bringing various kinds of 
drinks, which he gave to him and to the monks. The following day he invited the 
whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality. It was as a result of the 
drinks offered by Keniya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks 
were permissible for monks and which were not (Vin.i.245f).</p>
<p>According to the Sutta Nipāta (p.104; 
M.ii.146f; see also ThagA.ii.47), it was owing to the elaborate preparations 
made by Keniya for the meal to the Buddha and the Sangha that the brahmin Sela, 
friend and counsellor of Keniya, came to discover the Buddha’s presence in Āpana. 
The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred 
pupils.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.440; MA.ii.779; 
Ap.i.318) that Keniya was a mahāsāla-brahmin, and that he became a Jatila with 
the object of protecting his wealth. He bought some land from the king and built 
his hermitage there, and became the protector (nissaya) of one thousand 
families. In his hermitage was a palm tree which yielded a golden nut each day. 
Keniya was a yellow-robed ascetic by day; by night he enjoyed the pleasures of 
the senses. On his first visit to the Buddha he took five hundred pingo-loads of 
badarapāna (SNA.ii.446) (? grape juice).</p>
<p>Keniya is mentioned (E.g., DA.i.270; see 
also DhA.i.323; UdA.241) as an example of one of the eight classes of ascetics — 
those who maintain wife and children (sa-puttabhariya).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Keniya.</b>-In the Apadāna (ii.469, v.16) 
Mahā Kappina is mentioned as having belonged to the Keniya-jāti. Perhaps this is 
a wrong reading; the corresponding verse in ThagA.i.510 gives Koliya.</p>
