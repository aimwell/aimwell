<p>A district in India, the birthplace of the Therī Cāpā. 
ThigA.220; but see SNA.i.259, where the janapada is called Vanga, not Vankahāra.
</p>
<p>It was probably to the south of Magadha (Sisters.132f).
</p>
<p>Upaka lived there for some time, first as an Ajīvaka and 
later as Cāpā’s husband. </p>
<p>The place is said to have been infested with fierce flies.
