  <h2>Gokanna</h2>

<hr>
<p>1. Gokanna.-A locality in Ceylon and a 
vihāra founded by Mahāsena, on the site of a Hindu temple (Mhv.xxxvii.41). 
According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.685), it was on the east coast of Ceylon. 
Elsewhere (p.269), the Tīkā speaks of a Gokannatittha in the neighbourhood of 
the estuary of the Mahākandara-nadī, and the Cūlavamsa (lxxi.18) mentions 
Gokanna as the last of a series of fords in Rohana, important from a strategic 
point of view, along the Mahā-vālkaugangā, from “Sarogāmatittha to Gokanna.” In 
another passage (Cv.xli.79), Gokanna(ka) is spoken of as mahannava (the ocean). 
These facts support Geiger’s conjecture (Cv. Trs.i.59, 4; n.316, n.2) that 
Gokanna refers to the Trincomalee (Koddiyar) Bay at the estuary of the 
Mahāvālukagangā.</p>
<p>Gokanna(ka) is twice described as the 
scene of magic rites, once in the case of Mahānāga (Cv.xli.79) and again in that 
of Mānavamma (Cv.lvii.5).</p>
<p>Aggabodhi V. built a padhānaghara for 
the Gokanna-vihāra. Cv.xlviii.5.</p>

<p>2. Gokanna.-A general of Gajabāhu who 
defeated Kittisirimegha; he had his headquarters in Kālavāpi, of which place he 
was Nagaragiri. At a meeting between him and Parakkamabāhu at Buddhagāma, the 
latter won him over to his side. An amusing story is told of a dream he had 
after his promise of help to Parakkamabāhu (Cv.lxvi.47ff). He fled, therefore, 
to Kālavāpi and, on various occasions, offered battle to the forces of 
Parakkamabāhu, but everywhere he was defeated, the worst reverse being at 
Nīlagala by the general Māyāgeha. After that he built a fortification in 
Kālavāpi, where he lived in comparative quiet. The last we hear of him is of his 
incitement of Mānābharana to seize the throne (Cv.lxiii.34; lxvi.35ff, 62; 
lxx.68, 71, 83, 257). Geiger thinks (Cv. Trs i.255, n.3) that Gokanna is 
probably a clan name.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Gokanna.-A general of Parakkamabāhu 
I. mentioned among leaders of the expedition which he sent to South India. 
Cv.lxxvi.253, 270, 324-6.</p>
