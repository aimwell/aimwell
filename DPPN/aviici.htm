  <h2>Avīci</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the eight great purgatories (mahāniraya) 
(J.v.266). It is ten thousand leagues in extent and forms part of a cakkavāla 
(SnA.ii.443).</p>
<p>The Milindapañha (p.5), however, places 
it outside the sphere of the earth. Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p.26) 
mentions a tradition which says that Avīci is seven hundred miles directly under 
the Bodhi Tree at Gaya. In later books, e.g. the Dhammapada Commentary, it is 
represented as being under the earth, for we are told that the earth opened wide 
to allow the flames of Avīci to escape and to drag down sinners into its bowels 
(E.g., DhA.i.127, 147; iii.181). It seems to have been specially designed for 
those who had committed very grievous crimes, among whom are </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Devadatta; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Cunda, the pork butcher; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Ānanda, who raped his cousin the Therī 
  Uppalavannā; </li>
  <li>
  <p>the ascetic Jambuka, who in a previous 
  birth had insulted an arahant; </li>
  <li>
  <p>the murderer of the Pacceka Buddha 
  Sunetta; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Sīvalī, who in a former birth had 
  blockaded a city for seven years; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Suppabuddha, who insulted the Buddha;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Mallikkā, because of her misbehaviour 
  with a dog (she was only there seven days); </li>
  <li>
  <p>Ciñcā-Mānavikā, because she falsely 
  accused the Buddha; </li>
  <li>
  <p>and Kapila, brother of Sodhana, for 
  reviling pious monks. </li>
</ul>
<p>For details and references see under 
these names; see also Mil.357.</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa, Avīci is often 
called Mahā Niraya (AA.i.376). Descriptions of it are to be found in several 
places in the four Nikāyas (E.g., M.iii.183; A.i.141-2). It is a quadrangular 
space, one hundred leagues each way, four-doored, walled all round and above 
with steel and with floor of incandescent molten steel.</p>
<p>The Dhammapadatthakathā gives a 
description of the tortures that await the entrant to Avīci. When, for instance, 
Devadatta entered there, his body became one hundred leagues in height, his 
head, as far as the outer ear, entered into an iron skull; his feet sank up to 
the ankles in iron, an iron stake as thick as the trunk of a palmyra tree came 
from the west wall, pierced the small of his back and, penetrating his breast, 
entered the east wall. Other similar stakes came from the south and from the 
north and transfixed him (DhA.i.148).</p>
<p>The fire of Avīci is so powerful that it 
destroys the eyes of anyone looking at it from a distance of one hundred leagues 
(A.i.142). It would destroy in a moment a rock as large as a gabled house, yet 
beings born there remain undestroyed, as though reposing in their mother’s womb 
(DhA.i.127; Mil.67).</p>
<p>Beings born in Avīci suffer for periods 
of varying lengths; thus, Mallikā, Pasenadi’s queen, remained only for seven 
days (DhA.iii.121), while Devadatta is destined to pass there 100,000 kappas 
(DhA.i.148). </p>
<p>The Sutta Nipata (p.126) gives the names 
of various specified periods of suffering, which, according to Buddhaghosa 
(SnA.i.476), are to be spent in Avīci; they are Abbuda, Nirabbuda, Ababa, Ahaha, 
Atata, Kumuda, Sogandhika, Uppalaka, Pundarīka, and Paduma, taken in a 
geometrical progression of twenty (i.e. twenty Abbudas=one Nirabbuda, etc.).</p>
<p>Another mode of suffering in Avīci is 
described as Sarājita (SA.iii.100).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the word Avīci 
occurs only once in the four Nikāyas — namely, in a passage in the 
Cakkavatti-Sīhānāda Sutta of the Digha Nikāya (D.iii.75; repeated in A.i.159) — 
but in this context there is no indication that the name refers to a purgatory. 
The word is not found in a list of purgatories given in the Sutta Nipāta 
(pp.126-31) and in the Samyutta (i.152). It is, however, found in a poem in the 
Itivuttaka (No. 89) which recurs both in the Vinaya (ii.203) and in the 
Dhammasangani (Section 1280), and there it is specifically called a niraya.</p>
<p>In the Digha passage mentioned above, 
the reference to Avīci is in connection with a tremendous growth of population 
which will occur in Jambudīpa in a future age. Houses will be so close that a 
cock could fly from any one to the next, and one would think it Avīci (avīci 
maññe).</p>
<p>Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.iii.73, n.1) 
that the word (which he translates as Waveless Deep) might have been originally 
used to denote density of population. Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.855) explains it as “nirantara-pūrita” 
perhaps in the sense that it is filled with fire. In the Visuddhi Magga (ii.449) 
the word appears to be a synonym for jars (disintegration) and is used in 
connection with the disintegration of earth, water, mountains, sun, moon, etc.</p>
<p>Avīci is often referred to as the lowest 
point of the universe (Thus, e.g.,Vsm.ii.390, 486; Mbv.57). </p>
<p>The chief suffering endured there is 
that of heat (MNidA., p.8).</p>
