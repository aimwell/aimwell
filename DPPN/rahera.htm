  <h2>Rahera, Raheraka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name is frequently mentioned in the Pāli Chronicles, sometimes as a 
locality, sometimes as a mountain (E.g., Mhv.xxi.5; Cv.xli.44; xliv.7), 
apparently situated (Mhv. Trs.176, n.2) to the north of, and not far from 
Anurādhapura. </p>
<p>It is also given as the name of a tank, repaired by Parakkamabāhu I. 
(Cv.lxxix.33), and also as that of an irrigation canal (dakavāra), given by 
Silākāla to the monks of Abhayagiri (Cv.xli.31). </p>
<p>Near Raheraka was the Kolambahālaka vihāra (q.v.).</p>
