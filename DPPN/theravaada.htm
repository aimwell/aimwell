  <h2>Theravāda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the Buddhist Canon as 
compiled by the Elders at the Rājagaha Council (Mhv.iii.40). </p>
<p>It was considered the most orthodox; 
from it seventeen other schools branched off from time to time in later ages, as 
a result of schisms in the Order (Mhv.v.1f). </p>
<p>The followers of Theravādā are called 
Theravādins (E.g., Cv.xxxviii.37) and their succession, Theravamsa (E.g., 
Cv.lii.46; liv.46).</p>
