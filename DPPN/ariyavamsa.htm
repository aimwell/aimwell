<p><b>1. Ariyavamsa.</b>-A compilation, probably 
of the life-histories of men eminent in the Buddhist Order, made in Ceylon and 
read aloud publicly for the edification of the people. The reading of the Ariyavamsa seems once to have been a regular feature of gatherings in the 
Buddhist vihāras on feast days. King Vohāraka-T1ssa made endowments for the 
giving of alms throughout Ceylon on the occasions when the Ariyavamsa was read 
(Mhv.xxxvi.38; Mhv.trans.258, n.6). A sutta called <b>Ariyavamsa Sutta</b> is mentioned 
in the Commentaries (DA.i.50; MA.i.14) as an example of a discourse preached by 
the Buddha on his own initiative (attajjhāsaya). This perhaps refers to the 
sermon on the four Ariyavamsā in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.27). See also

<p><b>2. Ariyavamsa</b>.-A celebrated teacher and 
author of the fifteenth century. He came from Pagan and was a member of the 
Chapata sect. He was a pupil of the famous Ye-din (“water-carrier”) of Sagaing 
(for an account of him see Bode, op. cit., 41f), and with great zeal and 
enthusiasm learnt the Abhidhammattha-vibhāvanī from his teacher. Later, 
Ariyavamsa wrote a commentary on this work and called it the Manisāramañjūsā. A 
charming anecdote is related of how he read the work to his colleagues and 
readily accepted their corrections with gratitude.</p>
<p>Among his other works are the Manidīpa, 
a Tīkā on the Atthasālinī, a grammatical treatise, the Gandhābharana, and a 
study of the Jātakas called the Jātakavisodhana.</p>
<p>Ariyavamsa spent only a part of his life 
at Sagaing and afterwards taught at Ava, where the king was sometimes among his 
listeners. He was among the first of Burmese litterateurs to write a 
metaphysical work in the vernacular — an Anutīkā on the Abhidhamma (Sās. 
p.41ff). The Gandha-Vamsa (64-5) attributes to him another work, the Mahānissara 
(Mahānissaya?), but no mention is made of it in the Sāsanavamsa.</p>
