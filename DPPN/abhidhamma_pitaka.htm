  <h2>Abhidhamma Pitaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The third division of the Pitakas. It 
consists of seven books: the </p>

  <li>
  <p>Dhammasanganī, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Vibhanga, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Kathāvatthu, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Puggalapaññatī, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Dhātukathā, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Yamaka and </li>
  <li>
  <p>Patthāna, </li>
</ol>
<p>all designated by the name of Pakarana. 
Only in the Chronicles and the Commentaries is the word used as the title of a 
third Pitaka (See the discussion of this in DA.i.15, 18f). In the Canon itself 
(E.g., Vin.i.64; iii.144; iv.344) the word means “special dhamma,” i.e. the 
Doctrine pure and simple (without admixture of literary treatment or 
personalities, etc.), and is sometimes coupled with the word abhivinaya (E.g., 
D.iii.267; M.i.272). </p>
<p>It has been suggested (New Pāli Dict. 
s.v.) that, as the word abhidhamma standing alone is not found either in the 
Sutta Nipāta, the Samyutta, or the Anguttara, and only once or twice in the 
Digha and Majjhima, it probably came into use only towards the end of the period 
in which the four great Nikāyas grew up (See Dial.iii.199 on a possible origin 
of the Adhidhamma).</p>
<p>The Mahāsanghikas refused to include the 
Abhidhamma in the Pitakas at all, as they did not regard it as the word of the 
Buddha. (Dpv.v.32-8).</p>
<p>According to the Dighabhānakas the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka also included the whole of the Khuddaka Nikāya except the 
Cariyāpitaka, Apadāna and Buddhavamsa (DA.i.15).</p>
<p>According to another division, the five 
Nikāyas are not divisions of the Dhamma but of the whole Canon, and in the fifth 
are included both the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma (DA.i.28).</p>
<p>There is a legend recorded by 
Buddhaghosa that the Abhidhamma was first preached by the Buddha in Tāvatimsa at 
the foot of the Pāricchataka tree, when he was seated on Sakka’s throne, during 
his visit to his mother in Tāvatimsa. Later it was taught by him to Sāriputta on 
the banks of the Anotatta Lake, whither Sāriputta had gone to minister to the 
Buddha during the latter’s visit to Tāvatimsa (VibhA. p.1; AA.i.71, etc.).</p>
<p>The legend further relates that after 
the Enlightenment the Buddha spent the fourth week in the Ratanaghara, revolving 
in his mind the intricate doctrines of the Abhidhamma in all their details 
(J.i.78).</p>
<p>According to the Cullavagga version of 
the Councils (Chaps. xi. and xii; but see DA.i.15 contra) the Abhidhamma Pitaka 
was not rehearsed at either Council.</p>
<p>The fact that the Abhidhamma is not 
mentioned in the suttas and that only Dhamma and Vinaya are usually referred to, 
only proves that at one time the Abhidhamma did not form a separate Pitaka. As a 
matter of fact, it is not held even by the commentators to be the word of the 
Buddha in the same sense as the suttas. One section of it, the Kathāvatthu (but 
see Kathāvatthu), was taught only at the Third Council.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the seven books of 
the Abhidhamma are peculiar to the Theravādins, though there is evidence that 
other schools, chiefly the Vaibhāsikas (Sarvāstivādins) and the Sautrāntikas, 
held the Abhidhamma books sacred. See Tārānātha: Geschichte des Buddhismus (56) 
156 (296).</p>
<p>As far as the contents of the Abhidhamma 
are concerned, they do not form a systematic philosophy, but are a special 
treatment of the Dhamma as found in the Sutta-Pitaka. Most of the matter is 
psychological and logical; the fundamental doctrines mentioned or discussed are 
those already propounded in the suttas and, therefore, taken for granted. For a 
discussion of the contents see article on Abhidhamma in ERE. </p>
<p>Apart from the Commentaries on the seven 
books, an exegetical work on the whole Pitaka, called the Abhidhamma Mūlatīkā, 
was written by Ānanda Vanaratanatissa of the Vanavāsī school in Ceylon.</p>
<p>The Tīkā was evidently based on 
Buddhaghosa’s Commentaries, but Ānanda occasionally dissents from Buddhaghosa. 
The work was written at the request of an Elder, Buddhamitta, and was revised by 
Mahā Kassapa of Pulatthipura.</p>
<p>An Anutīkā was written by Culla 
Dhammapāla. Gv.60, 69. For details see P.L.C., pp. 210-12. The Gv. (72) also 
mentions Abhidhammagandhi, probably a glossary.</p>
