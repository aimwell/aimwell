<p>The port from which the branch of the 
Bodhi-tree was sent to Ceylon by Asoka (Mhv.xi.38; Dpv.iii.33). It is said 
(Sp.i.90f) that Asoka came from Pātaliputta, crossed the Ganges by boat, 
traversed the Vinijhātavi, and so arrived at Tāmalitti. </p>
<p>It is identified with modern Tamluk, 
formerly on the estuary of the Ganges, but now on the western bank of the 
Rūpnārāyana. </p>
<p>When Fa Hsien came to Ceylon, he 
embarked at Tāmluk. Giles: op. cit. p.65.</p>
