  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of Mallikā, wife 
  of Bandhula, who, after death, was born in a wonderful palace in Tāvatimsa, 
  surrounded by all manner of luxuries.  </p>
<p>This was chiefly as a result of her 
  having offered her Mahālatāpasādhana in honour of the Buddha, after his death. 
</p>
<p>Moggallāna met her in Tāvatimsa and heard her story.
