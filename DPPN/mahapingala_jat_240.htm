  <h2>Mahāpingala Jātaka (No. 240)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mahāpingala was once king of Benares; he was extremely 
wicked and quite pitiless. When he died the people were delighted, and burnt his 
body with one thousand cartloads of wood amidst great festivity. They then 
elected his son, the Bodhisatta, as king. He noticed that while all others 
rejoiced, the palace doorkeeper wept, and inquired the reason. The man replied 
that Mahāpingala would strike him on the head in passing eight times a day. He 
was sure, he would treat Yama in like fashion, and would be banished from hell 
and return to his palace where he would again start to assault him. The 
Bodhisatta told the man it would be quite impossible for Mahāpingala to rise 
from hell.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the great joy shown by 
multitudes of people at the death of Devadatta. Devadatta is identified with 
Mahāpingala. J.ii.239ff.; DhA.i.126f.</p>
