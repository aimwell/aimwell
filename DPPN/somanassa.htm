<p><b>1. Somanassa.</b> A king of <a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a>, who is credited 
with having founded the city of <a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a>. J.vi.47, 51.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Somanassa. </b>The Bodhisatta born as the son of 
Renu, king of Uttarapañcāla. See the <a href="somanassa_jat_505.htm" title="s/somanassa_jat_505.htm">Somanassa Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Somanassa.</b> A Pacceka Buddha. Once, when the 
Buddha was staying at <a href="indasaalaguhaa.htm" title="i_/indasaalaguhaa.htm">Indasālaguhā</a> in 
<a href="vediya.htm" title="vy/vediya.htm">Vediyakapabbata</a>, an owl became fond of 
him, and even when he went for alms would accompany him half way, wait for his 
return, and then go back with him. One day when the Buddha was seated in the 
assembly of monks, the owl descended from its rock and worshipped him by 
lowering its wings, putting together its claws and bending its head.  </p>
<p>The Buddha, 
seeing this, smiled, and said, in answer to Ānanda’s question, that one hundred 
thousand kappas hence the bird would become a Pacceka Buddha, Somanassa by name.
