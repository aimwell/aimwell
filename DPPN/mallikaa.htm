<p><b>1. Mallikā.</b> Chief queen of 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>, king of Kosala. She was the 
daughter of the chief garland maker of Kosala, and was very good and beautiful. 
When she was sixteen she was, one day, on her way to the garden with some 
companions, carrying with her three portions of sour gruel in a basket. Meeting 
the Buddha, she offered them to him and worshipped him. The Buddha, seeing her 
wrapt in joy, smiled, and, in answer to Ānanda’s question, said she would be 
chief queen of Kosala that very day. J.iii.405; SA.i.110ff. It was to explain 
Mallikā’s good fortune that the <a href="kummaasapinda_jat_416.htm" title="ku/kummaasapinda_jat_416.htm">Kummāsapinda Jātaka</a> was preached.</p>
<p>It happened that Pasenadi, having suffered defeat at the 
hands of <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> that very day, was passing by and entered the flower garden, 
attracted by Mallikā’s voice. Mallikā, seeing him coming, and noting his 
weariness, seized his horse’s bridle. The king, discovering that she was 
unmarried, dismounted, and, having rested awhile, his head on her lap, entered 
the town with her and took her to her own house. In the evening he sent a 
chariot for her, and with great honour and pomp brought her from her own home, 
set her on a heap of jewels and anointed her chief queen. From that day onward 
she was the beloved and devoted wife of the king and an undeviating follower of 
the Buddha (DhA.iii.121f). The king found her sagacious and practical minded and 
consulted her and accepted her advice when in difficulty — 
e.g., in the <a href="asadisadaana.htm" title="ay/asadisadaana.htm">Asadisa</a><a href="asadisadaana.htm" title="ay/asadisadaana.htm">-dāna</a>, wherein he wished 
to excel his subjects, and again when he was troubled by evil dreams as narrated 
in the <a href="mahasupina_jat_077.htm" title="maha/mahasupina_jat_077.htm">Mahāsupīna Jātaka</a>. DhA.ii.8ff. says that Mallikā called the king a simpleton for putting his faith in brahmins and took 
him to the Buddha, and while the king sat trembling, asked the questions for him 
and had them explained. </p>
<p>The Jātaka states how Mallikā saved many innocent lives 
from being sacrificed, and the Buddha declared that in a past life too, as Dinnā 
(q.v.), she had saved the lives of a large number of people by her wisdom 
(DhA.ii.15f).</p>
<p>Both Mallikā and Pasenadi’s other queen, 
<a href="vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm" title="va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm">Vāsabhakhattiyā</a>, 
desired to learn the Dhamma, and, at their request conveyed through Pasenadi, 
the Buddha asked Ānanda to visit the palace regularly and teach them the 
Doctrine. Ānanda found in Mallikā an apt and ready pupil, conscientious in her 
work; Vāsabhakhattiyā was not so devoted to her duties. DhA.i.382f.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For an incident connected with Ānanda’s visit to the palace, see Vin.iv.158f.
</p>
<p>Mallika’s knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than 
Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked 
if anyone were dearer to her than her own “self.” “No, Sire,” was the answer; 
the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who 
explained to him that Mallikā, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth 
(S.i.75; Ud.v.1). Mallikā, though an exemplary wife, was not without lapses. 
Reference is made to the quarrels she had with her husband, once, at least, on 
the question of conjugal rights, as a result of which they both sulked and had 
to be reconciled by the Buddha. J.iv.437; also J.iii.20; in these quarrels the 
king was probably more to blame than Mallikā; it is said that until reconciled 
by the Buddha he ignored her very existence, saying that prosperity had turned 
her head. </p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.119ff) relates a 
ridiculous story about her misbehaviour with a dog in the bath house. Pasenadi 
was a witness of this scene, but she was able to convince him that it was the 
fault of the lighting of the bath house. Nevertheless, it is said that at the 
moment of her death she recollected this misdeed, and, as a result, was reborn 
in <a href="aviici.htm" title="ay/aviici.htm">Avīci</a>. The king was overcome by grief at Mallika’s death, and, after the 
funeral rites, went to the Buddha to ask where she had been reborn. The Buddha, 
not wishing him to know, caused the king to forget the question, every time he 
came to the vihāra, for a whole week, till Mallikā’s suffering in Avīci was 
over; then he allowed the question to be asked, and he was able to assure 
Pasenadi that she had been reborn in <a href="tusita.htm" title="t/tusita.htm">Tusita</a> and to console him in his grief. It 
is said (A.iii.57) that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came 
with the whispered message that the queen was dead. It was a terrible shock, 
“his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak.”</p>
<p>Mallikā had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of 
a son. Probably <a href="vajiraakumaarii.htm" title="va/vajiraakumaarii.htm">Vajīrī</a>, who is spoken of as the king’s only daughter 
(M.ii.110). He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a 
girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men 
(S.i.86f).</p>
<p>Mallikā is mentioned (Mil. 115, 291) as one of seven 
persons whose acts of devotion bore fruit in this life and whose fame reached 
even to the gods. Only one instance is on record of Mallikā asking a question of 
the Buddha. She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some 
rich, and others poor. And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these 
discrepancies (See <a href="mallikaa_s.htm" title="ma/mallikaa_s.htm">Mallikā Sutta 1</a>).</p>
<p>In the <a href="piyajatika_sutta.htm" title="pu/piyajatika_sutta.htm">Piyajātika Sutta</a> (M.ii.106ff ) Pasenadi is said to 
have taunted her because “her recluse Gotama” had said that dear ones bring 
sorrow and tribulation. “If the Lord says so, it must be so,” she replies; but 
secretly sends Nālijangha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so 
and why. Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him 
too that the Buddha is right.</p>
<p>Mallikā had a garden, called the Mallikārāma, in which was 
a Hall among the Deispyros trees (tindukācīra) set apart for religious 
discussions between members of various sects (samayappavādaka). M.ii.22; MA.710; 
D.i.178; see <a href="ekasaalaa.htm" title="e/ekasaalaa.htm">Ekasālā</a>. </p>
