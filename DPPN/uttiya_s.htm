<p>1. Uttiya or Uttika Sutta.-Uttiya Thera 
visits the Buddha and asks him for an explanation of the five sensual elements (kāmagunā) 
mentioned by him. The Buddha explains them, and declares that they should be 
abandoned in order that the Noble Eightfold Path might be cultivated. S.v.22.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Uttiya or Uttika Sutta.-Uttiya asks 
the Buddha for a teaching in brief, on which he might meditate while dwelling in 
solitude. The Buddha tells him that he must purify “the rudiments in good 
states” (ādim eva visodhehi kusalesu dhammesu), and proceeds to mention the four 
satipatthānas. As a result of developing the latter Uttiya became an arahant. 
S.v.166.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Uttiya or Uttika Sutta.-The 
Paribbājaka Uttiya visits the Buddha and asks him his views regarding the 
eternity of the world, the end of the world, the identity of body and soul, and 
the continuation of the existence of the Tathāgata after death. The Buddha 
replies that he teaches nothing about such things, but that the object of his 
teaching is to enable beings to realise emancipation. Thereupon Uttiya asks the 
Buddha whether the world is led to follow that teaching. The Buddha remains 
silent. Ānanda, wishing to prevent any misunderstanding on the part of Uttiya, 
explains that there is no “leading,” but that the Buddha knows that all those 
who escape from the world do so along a certain path, just as the gate-keeper of 
a well-guarded town knows that whoever enters that town must, inevitably, use 
the one entrance. A.v.193-5.</p>
