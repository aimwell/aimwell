<p>The son of Mātanga, a landowner of Kosala. He was idle, 
and, when rebuked, joined the monks, hoping thus to have an easy life. But one 
day he heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and not long after became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a mighty Nāga 
king, and, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, he honoured him by 
giving him his throat jewel (Thag.vss.231 3; ThagA.i.348ff). He is probably 
identical with Manipūjaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.413f.</p>
