  <h2>Ajita-Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a poor brahmin family of 
Sāvatthi, and was so called because at birth he was wrapped in an antelope skin. 
He saw the presentation of Jetavana and, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha, 
joined the Order and later became an arahant. But because of past misdeeds he 
remained unhonoured and unknown, and on this account was despised by worldly 
novices (Thag.129-30; ThagA.i.250f). </p>
<p>He is evidently to be identified with 
Ghatamandadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.436). In a previous birth he gave 
butter as medicine to the Pacceka Buddha, Sucintita.&nbsp; </p>
