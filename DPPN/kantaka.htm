</ul>
<p>A novice ordained by Upananda. Kantaka 
committed an offence with another novice, Mahaka. When this became known, a rule 
was passed that no monk should ordain two novices (Vin.i.79); this rule was, 
however, later rescinded (Vin.i.83). Elsewhere (Vin.i.85), Kantaka is mentioned 
as being expelled from the Order for having had sexual intercourse with a nun, 
Kantakā by name. According to the Pacittiya (Vin.iv.138f), Kantaka held the same 
false views as Arittha (q.v.), and for that reason he was expelled from the 
Sangha. The Chabbaggiya monks, however, received him into their ranks and gave 
him every encouragement. In the Samantapāsadikā (iv.874) Kantakasāmanera is 
mentioned with Arittha and the Vajjiputtakas, as having been an enemy of the 
Buddha’s religion.</p>
