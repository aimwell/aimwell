  </li>
</ul>
<p>The inhabitants of the lowest (Cātummahārājika) 
deva world.  </p>
<p>This world derives its name from the Four Great Kings (<b>Cattāro 
Mahārājāno</b>) who dwell there as guardians of the four quarters;  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Dhatarattha of 
the East, </li>
  <li>Virūlhaka of the South, </li>
  <li>Virūpakkha of the West, and </li>
  <li>Vessarana of the 
North (D.ii.207f; iii.194f). </li>
</ol>
<p>They keep large retinues consisting, respectively, 
of Gandhabbas, Kumbhandas, Nāgas and Yakkhas, all of whom dwell in the same 
world as their lords and accompany them on their travels. These kings are 
mentioned (D.ii.257f) as having undertaken the protection of the Buddha from the 
moment of his conception in his mother’s womb, and in the 
<a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Ātānātiya Sutta</a>, they appear as protectors not only of the Buddha but also of his 
followers (See, e.g., DhA.ii.146; iii.96).</p>
<p>The Four Kings appear to have been 
regarded as Recorders of the happenings in the assemblies of the devas 
(D.ii.225). On the eighth day of the lunar half-month, they send their 
councillors out into the world to discover if men cultivate righteousness and 
virtue; on the fourteenth day they send their sons, on the fifteenth day they 
themselves appear in the world, all these visits having the same purpose. Then, 
at the assembly of the devas, they submit their report to the gods of Tāvatimsa, 
who rejoice or lament according as to whether men prosper in righteousness or 
not (A.i.142f.; for more details see AA.i.376f). </p>
<p>These four Gods surpass the other inhabitants of their worlds in ten ways — 
beauty, length of life, etc. — because their merit is greater than that of the 
others (A.iv.242).</p>
<p>Besides these Regent Gods and their 
followers, other dwellers are to be found in their world — the Khiddāpadosikā, 
the Manopadosikā, the Sitavalāhakā, the Unhavalāhakā, and the devaputtas Candima 
and Suriya (VibhA.519; MNidA.108).  </p>
<p>Life in the Cātummahārājikā world lasts, 
according to human computation, ninety thousand years (DA.ii.472, 647, but see 
Kvu.207). Beings are born there as a result of various acts of piety and faith 
which, however, are based on motives not very exalted (A.iv.60).</p>
<p>The Cātummahārājikā world is situated 
half-way up Mount Sineru. Some of the devas of the world dwell in the mountain, 
others in the sky. (On these gods see Moulton: Zoroastrianism 22-7, 242.)</p>
