<p>1. Cittarāja.-A Yakkha. It was the 
custom for ancient kings at the time of the Kattika Festival to deck themselves 
in great array and, standing on the bank of a lake “in the presence of Cittarāja,” 
(meaning, probably, in front of his statue) to shoot arrows to the four 
quarters. J.ii.372.</p>
<p>2. Cittarāja.-A Yakkha whom Pandukābhaya 
honoured by giving him a settlement at the lower end of the Abhaya tank. On 
festival days the Yakkha occupied a seat beside the king. The Mahāvamsa (xi.4, 
84, 87, 104) says that Citta-rāja was an incarnation of the 
herdsman Citta (7) who saved Panduka-bhaya’s life, but it is more likely that 
the Cittarāja mentioned here is identical with Cittarāja (1), and that the 
festival refers to the Kattika festival.</p>
