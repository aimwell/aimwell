<p>A place in Anurādhapura, where Devānampiyatissa offered 
Mahinda a mango, which he ate on the spot, and caused the seed to be planted. 
Immediately there sprouted from it a tall tree, bearing mangoes. This place 
later became the centre of distribution of various gifts to the monks 
(Mhv.xv.38). </p>
<p>After Mahinda’s death, the bier containing his body was 
placed here for a week, and many honours were shown to it prior to its cremation 
(Ibid., xx.39). This is probably the same as Pañcambamālaka (q.v.).</p>
