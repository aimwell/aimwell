<p>Once a man of Rājagaha had just 
  sat down to eat when he saw a monk, who had travelled far, standing outside 
  his house.  </p>
<p>He emptied his food into the monk’s bowl.  </p>
<p>When he died he was 
  reborn in Tāvatimsa in a golden palace twelve yojanas in height. Vv.vi.6; 
  VvA.292f.</p>
