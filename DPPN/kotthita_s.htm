<p>1. Kotthita Sutta.-A conversation 
between Mahā Kotthita and Sāriputta as to whether or not anything exists after 
the passionless ending, without remainder, of the six spheres of contact (phassāyata 
nānam asesavirāganirodhā). The conversation is repeated between Mahā Kotthita 
and Ānanda. A.ii.161f</p>
<p>2. Kotthita Sutta.-Mahā Kotthita asks 
Sāriputta a series of questions as to why the holy life (brahmacariyā) is lived 
by the Blessed One, to all of which Sāriputta answers “No.” He then goes on to 
explain that the purpose of the holy life is the realisation of the four Ariyan 
truths. A.iv.382f.</p>
<p>3. Kotthita Sutta.-Three suttas. Mahā 
Kotthita visits the Buddha and asks for a brief statement of the Dhamma. The 
Buddha answers that desire should be put away for that which is (1) impermanent, 
(2) Ill, (3) without a self. S.iv.145f.</p>
<p>4. Kotthita Sutta.-Kotthita visits 
Sāriputta at Isipatana and asks him which is true: to say that the eye is the 
bond of objects or that objects are the bond of the eye? Sāriputta replies that 
neither is true: the bond consists in the desire and lust arising from their 
contact. If two men be yoked one to the other, the bond consists not in either 
of the men but in the yoke-tie which binds them. If this were not so, the 
religious life would be purposeless. S.iv.162f</p>
<p>5. Kotthita Sutta.-A group of three 
suttas containing conversations between Mahā Kotthita and Sāriputta on what 
constitutes ignorance. S.iii.175.</p>
