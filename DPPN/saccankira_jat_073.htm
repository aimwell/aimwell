<p>The king of Benares had a son called Dutthakumāra, who was 
hated by everyone. One day, when he was bathing in the river, a storm came on, 
and he ordered his servants to take him into the middle of the river and there 
bathe him. The servants thereupon flung him into the water and reported to the 
king that he was lost. As he was swept along on the stream, he caught hold of a 
tree trunk, and on to this tree trunk there came to cling, also, a snake, a rat, 
and a parrot, who had all lost their dwelling places in the storm. The 
Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic living on the bank of the river, rescued Duttha 
and his companions and looked after them. When they bade him farewell, the snake 
said that he had forty crores hidden in a certain spot, and the ascetic had only 
to ask for these and they were hits. The rat had thirty crores, also at the 
ascetic’s disposal; the parrot promised the ascetic wagonloads of rice; and 
Duttha promised to provide him with the four requisites. In his heart, however, 
he hated the ascetic for an imaginary slight, and vowed vengeance.</p>
<p>After Duttha became king, the ascetic wished to test the 
faith of his former guests. He went to the snake and called out his name, and 
the snake at once appeared, offering his treasure. The rat and the parrot did 
likewise, but Duttha, riding in a procession and seeing him from afar, gave 
orders that the ascetic should be beaten and put to death. On his way to the 
place of execution the ascetic kept on repeating: “They knew the world who 
framed this proverb true: a log pays better salvage than some men!” When asked 
what these words meant, he related the whole story.</p>
<p>The enraged citizens, seizing Duttha, put him to death and 
made the ascetic king. Later, he brought the snake, the rat, and the parrot to 
the palace and looked after them.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta’s attempts to 
kill the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with Duttha, the snake with Sāriputta, 
the rat with Moggallāna, and the parrot with Ānanda. J.i.322 7.</p>
