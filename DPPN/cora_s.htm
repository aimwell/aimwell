<p>1. Cora Sutta.-An evil monk is like a 
robber-chief, in that he relies on roughness of the way, the entanglements, the 
help of the powerful; he gives bribes and works alone. A.iii.128f.</p>
<p>2. Cora Sutta.-There are eight things 
which lead to speedy disaster in the case of a robber — he strikes those who do 
not strike back, takes away everything completely, kills women, seduces maidens, 
robs recluses, despoils the king’s treasury, carries out his activities too 
near, is unskilled in storing up his gain (A.iv.339).</p>
