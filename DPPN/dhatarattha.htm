The name of his daughter is <a href="sirii.htm" title="s/sirii.htm">Sirī</a> (J.iii.257).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dhatarattha.</b>-A mythical king, 
mentioned in a list of kings — with Vessāmitta, Atthaka, Yāmataggi, Usinnara and 
Sivi — as having entered Sakka’s heaven by virtue of his righteousness and his 
waiting on pious men. J.vi.251.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Dhatarattha.</b>-There were two kings of 
this name, contemporaries and vassals of <a href="renu.htm" title="r/renu.htm">Renu</a>. One of these two was king of 
<a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Angā</a> 
with his capital in <a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, and the other of the

<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. D.ii.235f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Dhatarattha.</b>-A <a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāga</a> king. Thanks to 
the scheming of the tortoise Cittacūla, he married Samuddajā, daughter of the 
king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. They had four sons: Sudassana, Bhūridatta, Subhaga and 
Kānārittha. His kingdom was beneath the <a href="yamunaa.htm" title="y/yamunaa.htm">Yamunā</a>. Dhatarattha is identified with 
Suddhodana. J.vi.162ff., 171.186, 200, 219. For details see the 
<a href="bhuridatta_jat_543.htm" title="b/bhuridatta_jat_543.htm">Bhūridatta 
Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Dhatarattha.</b>-The Bodhisatta born as 
king of the hamsas. He lived in Cittakūta, at the head of ninety thousand hamsas. 
One day he was caught in a snare on the lake Khemā, set by the orders of King 
Bahuputtaka. Dhatarattha’s friend, Sumukha, refused to leave him while he was 
caught. The two friends melted the heart of the hunter when he came to take 
Dhatarattha, and later they were brought before the king. Dhatarattha preached 
the Doctrine to the king and to his queen, Khemā, who longed to hear a hamsa 
preach (J.iv.425ff; for details see the <a href="hamsa_jat_502.htm" title="h/hamsa_jat_502.htm">Hamsa Jātaka</a>). Dhatarattha is often 
referred toe as a king surrounded by a splendid following. E.g., DA.i.40; 
MA.ii.576; UdA.57, 412; PvA.171.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Dhatarattha.</b>-The family of hamsas to 
which belonged Dhatarattha, king of the hamsas. The members of this family are 
called Dhataratthā. They were golden-coloured and lived in Cittakūta. The Mahā-Sutasoma 
Jātaka (J.v.345, 355, 357) contains a story of the complete destruction of these 
hamsas. They lived in Kañcanaguhā, and during the four months of the rainy 
season would not leave their cave, in case their wings should be drenched with 
water and they fell into the sea. A spider, as big as a cartwheel, used to weave 
a thick web at the entrance to the cave, but the Dhatarattha geese sent one of 
their young ones, who had received two portions of food, to cut through the web. 
One season, however, the rains lasted for four months, and the hamsas became 
cannibals and thus lost their strength. When, at the end of the rains, they 
tried to break through the web, they failed, and the spider cut off their heads 
one by one and drank their blood. This was the end of the Dhatarattha hamsas. J.v.469f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Dhatarattha</b>.-A class of Nāgas 
(D.ii.259), descendants of the Nāga king Dhatarattha and of Samuddajā 
(J.vi.219), and possessed great power. They dwell in the Sattasidantara-samuda 
(SA.ii.254).</p>
