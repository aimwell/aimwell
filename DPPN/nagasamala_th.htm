<h4>1. Nāgasamāla Thera</h4>
<p>He was a <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> and entered the Order when the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> 
visited his kinsmen at <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>. For some time he was the Buddha’s personal 
attendant&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., when the Buddha breached the
<a href="mahasihanada_s.htm" title="maha/mahasihanada_s.htm">Mahāsihanāda Sutta</a> (or 
the Lomahamsa-pariyāya) (M.i.83 ; MA.i.283; AA.i.163; UdA. 217; J.iv.95).  </p>
<p>One day, when entering the city for alms, he saw a nautch girl gaily dressed, 
dancing to the accompaniment of music and contemplated her as the snare of 
<a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a>. 
Making this his topic of thought, he developed insight into the perishable ness 
of life and became an arahant (Thag.vs.267 70; ThagA.i.378). Another day 
(evidently earlier than the previous incident), while walking with the Buddha, 
they came to a cleft in the road, and the Buddha wished to go along one way, 
while Nāgasamāla wished to go along another, in spite of the Buddha’s warning 
that it was dangerous. In the end, he put the Buddha’s begging bowl and robe on 
the ground and left him. Brigands waylaid him and ill treated him, breaking his 
bowl and threatening to kill him. Thereupon he turned back to the Buddha and 
asked his forgiveness (Ud.viii.7; UdA.425f).</p>
<p>Nāgasamāla was a householder in the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha, and, seeing the Buddha walking in the sun, he gave him an umbrella. 
After that, wherever he went a white parasol appeared over his head. For thirty 
kappas he was king of the gods. He is probably to be identified with Ekachattiya 
of the Apadana. Ap.ii.405</p>

<h4>2. Nāgasamāla Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. The Apadana (Ap.i.119) distinguishes him from 
the above, whom it calls Ekachattiya. Thirty one kappas ago he placed a pātali 
flower on the thupa of Sikhī Buddha. Fifteen kappas ago he was a king named 
Bhūmiya.</p>
<p>The Apadana Commentary says, however, that this thera was 
the pacchāsamana (personal attendant) of the Buddha for some time and that he 
was called Nāgasamāla because his body was tender as nāgabuds.</p>
