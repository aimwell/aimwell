  <h2>Atthakarana Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Pasenadi tells the Buddha how, when he 
was sitting in the judgment-hall (atthakarana), eminent nobles and brahmins and 
burgesses deliberately told lies because of their worldly desires and he was 
disgusted. </p>
<p>The Buddha tells him that their action 
in doing so will be a source of ill to them for a long time. (AttaÂ°). S.i.74f.</p>
