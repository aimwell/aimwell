<p>A mountain, slightly over two yojanas to 
the south-east of Anurādhapura. At the foot was a bamboo-grove in which grew 
three bamboo-stems, each being a waggon-pole in girth — known as latāyatthi, 
kusumayatthi and sakunayatthi — because of Devānampiyatissa’s good fortune 
(Mhv.xi.10; Dpv.xi.15, 19; Sp.i.74. For an explanation of these yatthis see 
IHQ.vi.571ff). Saddhātissa afterwards built a vihāra there, called the 
Chātavihāra (MT.300). The Anguttara Commentary (i.15) has a reference to a 
novice dwelling in Chātapabbata who came to grief after hearing a woman’s voice.</p>
