<p>A Yakkha who tried to frighten the 
Buddha, but who, later, became his disciple (Ud.4-5). When he returned from a 
certain Yakkha-assembly he found the Buddha seated on his couch, as had already 
been told to him in the assembly by <a href="satagira.htm" title="sa/satagira.htm">Satāgira</a> and 
<a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a>. In anger he 
tried in various ways to cast out the Buddha, but failed in his efforts and 
ended by becoming his disciple (UdA.63ff. For a note on this passage see J.P.T.S. 
1886, 94ff).</p>
<p>Two explanations are given of his name: 
aje kalāpetvā bandhanena ajakotthāsena saddhim balim paticchati, no aññathā . . 
. kecipana ajake viya satte lāpetīti, Ajaka-lāpako ti (UdA.64 ) (those bringing 
him sacrifices bleat like goats).</p>
