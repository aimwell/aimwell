<p>A branch of the Sākiyas. When Vidūdabha waged war on the 
Sakiyas, he gave orders that all those calling themselves by the name of Sakiya 
should be slain. His men went about asking for those who were called Sakiyas. 
Some of these therefore took blades of grass in their teeth and others reeds. 
When asked if they were Sakiyas, the former said “not sāka ” (potherb) but 
“grass,” (tina), and the latter “not sāka ” (potherb) but “reed” (nala). Owing 
to this play on their name they escaped death. Thenceforth they were known 
respectively as Tinasākiya and Nalasākiya (DhA.i.358f).</p>
