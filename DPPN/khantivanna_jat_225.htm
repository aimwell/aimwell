  <h2>Khantivanna Jātaka (No.225)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A courtier of Brahmadatta, king of 
Benares, started an intrigue in the king’s harem, and a servant of the courtier 
did likewise in his master’s house. When the courtier brought the servant to the 
king, the king advised the master to be patient, as good servants were rare, 
and, said the king, he knew of a courtier who had acted in the same way, but his 
king did not wish to lose him.</p>
<p>The story was related to the king of 
Kosala, who had been made a cuckold by one of his young and zealous courtiers.
