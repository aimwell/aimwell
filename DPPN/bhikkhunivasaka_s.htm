  <h2>Bhikkhunīvāsaka Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ānanda visits a settlement of nuns at Sāvatthi and is told 
that the nuns who have cultivated the four satipatthānas have attained to 
greater excellence of comprehension than before. Ānanda says that is how it 
should be. Later, he visits the Buddha and reports to him the incident. The 
Buddha tells him how to develop the satipatthānas and of the advantages 
resulting there from. </p>
<p>The sutta ends with an exhortation to earnestness and 
diligence. There are plenty of places suitable for meditation, one should not 
therefore be remiss with regard to this. S.v.154f.</p>
