<p>King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He was very fond of 
watching dancing and had three dancing halls where girls and women, of various 
ages, danced for his pleasure. One day he noticed a house-holder’s wife who had 
come to watch the dance and longed to possess her. On realising the wickedness 
of his desire, he renounced the kingdom and became a Pacceka Buddha. </p>
<p>His Udānagāthā is included in the 
Khaggavisāna Sutta. SN.vs.63; SNA.i.115f.; Ap.i., p. II (vs.37); ApA.i.160f.</p>
