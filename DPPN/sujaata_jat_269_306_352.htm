<p><b>1. Sujāta Jātaka (No. 269).</b> The Bodhisatta was once 
king of Benares. His mother was a passionate woman, harsh and ill tongued, and 
the Bodhisatta waited for an opportunity of admonishing her. One day, as he 
accompanied her to the park, a blue jay screeched, and the courtiers stopped 
their ears, saying: “What a scream! Stop it!” On another day they heard a cuckoo 
singing and stood listening eagerly. The Bodhisatta pointed this out to his 
mother and left her to draw her own inference. She understood and reformed 
herself.</p>
<p>The story was related to Anāthapindika’s daughter in law, 
<a href="sujaataa.htm" title="s/sujaataa.htm">Sujātā</a>, who was identified with the queen mother. J.ii.347-51.</p>

<p><b>2. Sujāta Jātaka (No. 306).</b> The Bodhisatta was once 
chaplain to the king of Benares. One day, the king heard a fruiterer’s daughter, 
Sujātā, hawking sweets, and falling in love with her voice he sent for her and 
made her his queen. Some time later she saw the king eating sweets from a golden 
dish and asked him what those egg shaped fruits were. The king was very angry; 
but the Bodhisatta interceded on her behalf and she was pardoned.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a quarrel between 
<a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a> and <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>, which became famous under the name of Sirivivāda or 
Sayanakalaha. Pasenadi ignored Mallikā completely, and the Buddha, knowing this, 
went to the palace with five hundred monks. The king invited them to a meal, and 
as the food was being served, the Buddha covered his bowl and asked for Mallikā. 
She was sent for, and the Buddha made peace between them. Mallikā is identified 
with Sujātā and Pasenadi with the king of Benares. J.iii.20-22.</p>

<p><b>3. Sujāta Jātaka (No. 352).</b> The Bodhisatta was once 
a landowner of Benares, named Sujāta. When his grandfather died his father gave 
himself up to despair and, having erected a mound over the dead man’s bones, 
spent all his time offering flowers there. Wishing to cure him, Sujāta feigned 
madness, and, seeing a dead ox outside the city, put grass and water near it and 
kept on trying to make it eat and drink. News of this was carried to his father, 
who hurried to the spot. In the course of their conversation Sujāta convinced 
his father of his folly.</p>
<p>The story was told to a lay follower of the Buddha who, 
after his father’s death, gave himself up to grief. The Buddha visited him and 
told him this story.</p>
<p>J.iii.155-7. The story is given in PvA.39f., but there it 
is related to the monks and not to the householder; he, however, became a 
sotāpanna.</p>
