<p>One of the four great continents into 
which the earth is divided. It is to the west of Sineru and is seven thousand 
yojanas in extent. It is surrounded by five hundred islands (SnA.ii.443). 
According to the Anguttara Nikāya (i.227; v.59), each cakkavāla (world-system) 
has an Aparagoyāna. It is inhabited by men (KhA.123), but they have no houses 
and sleep on the ground (ThagA.ii.187-8). In the centre of the continent is a 
Kadamba tree, whose trunk is fifteen yojanas in girth and whose trunk and arms 
are fifty yojanas in length.</p>
<p>This tree stands for a whole kappa 
(DhsA.298; AA.i.264; Vm.206). When the sun rises in Jambudīpa, it is the middle 
watch of the night in Aparagoyāna; sunset in Aparagoyāna is midnight in 
Jambudīpa, and sunrise is noon in Jambudīpa, sunset in Pubbavideha and midnight 
in Uttarakuru (DA.iii.868). A cakkavatti-king first conquers Pubbavideha in the 
east and Jambudīpa in the south, and then sets out to win Aparagoyāna in the 
west and Uttarakuru in the north (Mbv.73-4; BuA.113). Thus King Mandhātā, having 
conquered Jambudīpa, journeys on with his retinue to Aparagoyāna and conquers it 
straight away (Dvy.215).</p>
<p>Punnaka, in his play with Dhanañjaya, 
staked a jewel, by gazing into which the continent of Aparagoyāna could be seen. 
J.vi.278; so also in the necklace mentioned in the Hārapradāna Jātaka. (Mtu.ii.68).</p>
<p>In this context the name given is 
Goyāniya. So also in the Mahāvastu: Aparagodānika, °godāniya (ii.159, 378, 
etc.). In the Dulva it is called Aparagaudani (Rockhill, 84).</p>
<p>Some of the inhabitants came with 
Mandhātā from Aparagoyāna to Jambudīpa and settled down there. The country they 
colonised was called Aparanta. DA.ii.482; MA.i.484.</p>
