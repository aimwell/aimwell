  <h2>Pañcālī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Wife of Esukārī, king of Benares. </p>
<p>When Esukārī longed for wealth, she showed him the folly 
of covetousness and persuaded him to become an ascetic, later entering to 
ascetic life herself. The story is related in the Hatthipāla Jātaka (q.v.).
</p>
<p>Pañcālī is identified with Mahāmāyā (J.iv.491). 
</p>
<p>The scholiast says (Ibid., 486) that she was called 
Pañcālī because she was the daughter of the Pañcāla king.</p>
