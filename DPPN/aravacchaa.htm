<p>One of the rivers crossed by Kappina on 
his way from his kingdom of Kukkutavatī to see the Buddha at Sāvatthi. 
</p>
<p>The river was one league deep and two 
leagues wide. </p>
<p>No boat was available, but the king and 
his retinue crossed it on horseback by meditating on the Three Jewels and the 
supreme power of the Buddha (DhA.ii.119-20). Later Kappina’s queen did likewise 
(DhA.ii.124).</p>
