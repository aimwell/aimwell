<p>The Bodhisatta born as the King of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He was the son of Janasandha (also called Dasaratha), and because his 
face was resplendent with beauty like a well-polished golden mirror, he was 
called Ādāsamukha. His father died when he was seven years old, and the 
courtiers tested the boy in various ways before crowning him king.</p>
<p>Reports of his wisdom soon spread abroad 
and once, when an old servant of his father’s (Gāmani Canda) was being brought 
to the court to answer various charges, fourteen problems were entrusted to him 
by different inhabitants of the kingdom to be placed before the king for 
solution. The king solved them all and ruled righteously.  </p>
<p>The story is given in 
the <a href="gaamani_jat_257.htm" title="g/gaamani_jat_257.htm">Gāmani Canda Jātaka</a>. J.ii.297-310.</p>
