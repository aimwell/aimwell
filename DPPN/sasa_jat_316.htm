<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a Hare. He lived with 
three friends: a Monkey, a Jackal, and an Otter. The three lived in great 
friendship, and the Hare was their guide in the good life. One day, the Hare, 
observing the approach of the full moon, told his friends that the next day 
would be a fast day and that they must collect food and give it to any beggar 
who approached them. The animals all went out very early in the morning, one by 
one; the Otter found some fish buried in the sand; the Jackal a dead lizard, 
some meat, and a pot of curds; and the Monkey some fruits; and, finding that 
nobody appeared to claim them, each took them to his own dwelling. The Hare had 
only kusa grass, which he could not offer to anyone. He therefore decided to 
give his own body, and, because of this brave decision, Sakka’s throne was 
heated. Disguised as a brahmin, he came to test the Hare. He went first to the 
other animals in turn and they all offered him what they had. He then approached 
the Hare, whom he asked for food. The Hare asked him to collect faggots from the 
wood and make a fire. Then, telling the brahmin that he would give him his own 
body, without the brahmin having the necessity of killing him, he shook out any 
animals which might lurk in his fur, and then jumped into the fire as into a 
lotusbed. By the power of Sakka, the fire remained as cool as snow, and Sakka 
revealed his identity. Then, so that the Hare’s nobility might be known to all 
the world, he took some essence of the Himālaya and painted the form of a hare 
in the moon, to remain there during this whole kappa. Having done this, he went 
to the Hare and talked of the Doctrine, and then, making the Hare lie down on 
his bed of grass, Sakka went back to his heaven.</p>
<p>The story was related in the course of giving thanks to a 
landowner of Sāvatthi who had entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven 
days. Ānanda is identified with the Otter, Moggallāna with the Jackal, and 
Sāriputta with the Monkey (J.iii.51 6).</p>
<p>The story is included in the Cariyāpitaka (i.10) and in 
the Jātakamālā (No. 6). It is also referred to in the Jayaddisa Jātaka (J.v.33). 
This Jātaka exemplifies the practice of dānapāramitā. BuA.50.</p>
