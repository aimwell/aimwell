<p>A Licchavi prince of Vesāli. He was, at one time, a member 
of the Order and the personal attendant of the Buddha (anibaddhaupatthāka), but 
was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the 
Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from 
other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not 
lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc. Sāriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesāli, 
heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached the 
Mahāsīhanāda Sutta (M.i.68ff.; the Buddha was, at this time, eighty years old, 
M.i.82) and the Lomahamsa Jātaka (J.i.389f.; see also J.iv.95). The Sunakkhatta 
Sutta (M.ii.252ff) was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the 
Order, while the Pātika Sutta (D.iii.1ff) gives an account of his 
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic 
superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things. The 
Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and 
that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the 
Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order 
because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that 
Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the 
Kālakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and 
the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was 
not convinced.</p>
<p>Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who 
died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher 
to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the 
Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of 
Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Tāvatimsa, to the effect that 
Pātikaputta was “a liar and a cheat,” and was later able to prove that these 
words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably 
remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in the 
Mahāli Sutta (D.i.152) the Licchavi Otthaddha relating to the Buddha how 
Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that 
he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds. Buddhaghosa 
explains (DA.i.311) that he could not acquire the power of hearing divine sounds 
because in a previous birth he had ruptured the ear drum of a holy monk and made 
him deaf. The Sutta itself gives (D.i.153) as the reason that he had only 
developed one sided concentration of mind.</p>
<p>Sunakkhatta is identified with Kānāritha of the Bhūridatta 
Jātaka. J.vi.219.</p>
