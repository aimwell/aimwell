<p><b>1. Sabhiya </b>(Sambhiya). The constant attendant of 
<a href="phussa.htm" title="pu/phussa.htm">Phussa</a> Buddha. J.i.41; Bu.xix.19.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="2"></a>2. Sabhiya Thera.</b> His mother was a nobleman’s 
daughter whose parents had committed her to the charge of a 
<a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājaka</a>, that 
she might learn various doctrines and usages. The Paribbājaka seduced her, and, 
when she was with child, the fraternity abandoned her. Her child was born in the 
open (sabhāyam), while she was wandering about alone&nbsp;&nbsp; hence his name. 
When Sabhiya grew up he, in his turn, became a Paribbājaka and was famous as a 
dialectician. He had a hermitage by the city gate, where he gave lessons to the 
sons of noblemen and others. He devised twenty questions, which he put before 
recluses and brahmins, but none could answer them. These questions had been 
handed on to him by his mother who had developed insight and had been reborn in 
a Brahma world. (But see Sabhiya Sutta 1). Then, as related in the <a href="#1">Sabhiya Sutta 
1</a>, Sabhiya visited the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> in 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a> and, at the end of the 
discussion, entered the Order, where, developing insight, he won arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="kakusandha.htm" title="ka/kakusandha.htm">Kakusandha</a> Buddha he was a householder and 
gave the Buddha a pair of sandals. After Kassapa Buddha’s death he, with six 
others, joined the Order and lived in the forest. Failing to develop jhāna, they 
went to the top of a mountain, determined to reach some attainment or to die of 
starvation. The eldest became an arahant, the next became an anāgāmī and was 
reborn in the <a href="suddhaavaasaa.htm" title="s/suddhaavaasaa.htm">Suddhāvasā</a>. The remaining five died without achieving their aim. 
These five were, in this age, <a href="pukkusati.htm" title="pu/pukkusati.htm">Pukkusāti</a>, Sabhiya, 
<a href="baahiya.htm" title="b/baahiya.htm">Bāhiya</a>, <a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kumārakassapa</a> and 
<a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabbamallaputta</a>. ThagA.i.381f.; SNA.ii.419ff.; Ap.ii.473; DhA.ii.212.</p>
<p>Sabhiya is mentioned as an example of a pandita 
Paribbājaka (SA.ii.188). A series of verses spoken by him, in admonishing monks 
who sided with <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>, are given in the 
<a href="theragaathaa.htm" title="t/theragaathaa.htm">Theragāthā</a> (vs. 275 8; see also 
Mtu.iii.389ff.). </p>
<p><a href="yasadatta_thera.htm" title="y/yasadatta_thera.htm">Yasadatta</a> (q.v.) was Sabhiya’s companion.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="3"></a>3. Sabhiya. </b>A <a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājaka</a>, perhaps identical with Sabhiya (2). The Samyutta (S.iv.401f ) records a discussion which took place at 
Ñātikā between him and <a href="vacchagotta.htm" title="va/vacchagotta.htm">Vacchagotta</a> on various questions, such as the existence 
of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> after death, etc. In this sutta, Sabhiya is addressed as 
<b>Kaccāna</b>, 
and he says that he had then been three years in the Order. It is probably this 
same Paribbājaka who is mentioned as Abhiya Kaccāna in the 
<a href="anuruddha_s_samy.htm" title="ay/anuruddha_s_samy.htm">Anuruddha Sutta</a>. 
M.iii.148f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="1s">1</a>. Sabhiya Sutta. </b>The sixth sutta of the 
<a href="mahavagga.htm" title="maha/mahavagga.htm">Mahāvagga</a> 
of the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a> (SN., pp. 91f). A devatā, who in a previous life had been a 
relation of Sabhiya (see Sabhiya 1), asks him a series of questions and exhorts 
him to join the Order of any recluse who can answer them satisfactorily. Sabhiya 
wanders about asking his questions of several well known teachers; failing to 
find satisfaction, he visits the Buddha in <a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a> at 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and is given 
permission to ask anything he wishes, the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> promising to solve his 
difficulties. Then follows a series of questions answered by the Buddha. Sabhiya, 
in the end, asks permission to join the Buddha’s Order. This permission is 
given, and after the usual probationary period of four months, he becomes an 
arahant.</p>
<p>According to the Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.382), 
quoted also in the Sutta Nipāta Commentary, the questions were formulated by 
Sabhiya’s mother, who, feeling revulsion for her womanhood, developed the jhānas 
and was reborn in a Brahma world. But the Sutta Nipāta Commentary itself 
(SNA.ii.421) says that they were taught to Sabhiya by an anāgāmī Brahmā, who had 
been a fellow celibate of Sabhiya in the time of Kassapa Buddha’s dispensation. 
The Sutta is also called Sabhiya pucchā, and is given (E.g., DA.i.155) as an 
example of the Buddha’s sabbaññupavārana, his willingness to answer any question 
whatever without restriction.</p>
<p>It is said (ThagA.i.427) that 
<a href="yasadatta_thera.htm" title="y/yasadatta_thera.htm">Yasadatta</a>, Sabhiya’s 
companion, was present at the discussion with the Buddha and listened eagerly 
hoping for a chance of criticism. But the Buddha read his thoughts and 
admonished him at the end of the sutta.</p>
<p>The questions contained in the sutta had been asked and 
answered in the time of Kassapa Buddha, too, but, while the questions remained, 
the answers disappeared. VibhA., p. 432.</p>

<p><b><a name="2s">2.</a> Sabhiya Sutta.</b> Records the discussion between 
Sabhiya Kaccāna (Sabhiya 2) and 
<a href="vacchagotta.htm" title="va/vacchagotta.htm">Vacchagotta</a>.
