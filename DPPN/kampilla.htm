  <h2>Kampilla (Kampillaka, Kampilliya)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A city in Uttarapañcāla, and probably 
its capital. Dummukha was once its king (J.iii.379; J.ii.214; also Mtu.i.283).
</p>
<p>Sometimes (E.g.,J.iii.79; iv.396; v.21; 
vi.391; 464) Kampilla is spoken of as being a kingdom, of which Uttarapañcala 
was a city.</p>
<p>Once Alīnasatta is spoken of as Kampilla 
because he was the king of the city of the same name. J.v.34; see also Rāmāyana 
i.34.</p>
