<p>A resident of Sāvatthi and friend of 
Sirigutta. The latter was a follower of the Buddha, and the former of the 
Niganthas. Instigated by the Niganthas, Garahadinna constantly blamed his friend 
for his allegiance to the Buddha, until one day, in exasperation, Sirigutta 
invited the Niganthas to his house in order to prove that their claim to 
omniscience was false. To this end he had a ditch dug and filled with filth, 
ropes stretched longitudinally over the ditch, and the seats so arranged that 
the moment the Niganthas sat down they would be tipped over and flung into the 
ditch. The Niganthas arrived, and everything happened as Sirigutta had arranged. 
Garahadinna, filled with desire for revenge, hid his resentment and invited the 
Buddha and his disciples with the intention of humiliating them. He employed the 
same stratagem as his friend, except that the ditch was filled with glowing 
coals instead of with filth. The Buddha came, knowing all that had happened, and 
by an exercise of iddhi-power caused large lotus flowers to spring up from the 
bed of coals. Sitting thereon, he created an abundant supply of food and 
preached the Dhamma. Garahadinna, Sirigutta, and many others became sotāpannas 
(DhA.i.434f).</p>
<p>On this occasion was also preached the 
Khadirangāra Jātaka. (But see the introductory Story of the Jātaka).</p>
<p>It is said (Mil.350) that when the 
Buddha preached at Garahadinna’s house, eighty-four thousand beings realised the 
Truth.</p>
