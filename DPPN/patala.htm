<h4>1. Pātala</h4>
<p>A dancer. He lived in a village near Benares. One day, 
having earned some money in a fete in the city, he sat down on the bank of the 
river, eating and drinking with his wife. He became drunk, and fastening his 
lute round his neck, he went with his wife down to the river. The water filled 
his lute and he began to sink. His wife thereupon let go of his hand and came 
out of the river. Seeing him about to drown, the wife begged of him one song 
wherewith to earn her living. He sang her a stanza to the effect that the water 
of the Ganges, which was the salvation of many, proved to be his bane.</p>
<p>This story was among those related by the Bodhisatta in 
the Padakusalamānava Jātaka (J.iii.507f). The Pārupanas made the use of this 
story in poking fun at the Ekamsikas, because the texts chosen by the Ekamsikas 
to prove their case proved just the contrary (see Bode, op cit., 76, n. 3.).</p>
