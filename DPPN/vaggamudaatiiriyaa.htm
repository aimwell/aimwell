<p>Monks who lived on the banks of the Vaggumudā, evidently 
distinct from Yasoja (q.v.) and his companions. When there was scarcity of food 
in the Vajji country these monks went about praising each other’s superhuman 
qualities so that the laymen, deceived by their pretensions, kept them in great 
luxury. When the Buddha discovered this, he rebuked them strongly and laid down 
the rules concerning the fourth Pārājikā offence. Vin.iii.87ff.; Sp.ii.481ff.; 
DhA.iii.480.</p>
