<p>A building attached to the Mahāvihāra and built by King Buddhadāsa.  
</p>
<p>Two 
  villages, Samana and Golapānu, were given for its maintenance (Cv.xxxvii.172; 
  also Cv. Trs.i.16, n.2.).  </p>
<p>The building was twenty five cubits high; Dhātusena 
  removed it and replaced it by a building twenty one cubits high 
  (Cv.xxxviii.52).  </p>
<p>It was restored by Mahānāga (Cv.xli.100), while Dāthopatissa 
  II. gave to it the village of Kesagāma (Cv.xlv.28). v.l. Moraparivena.</p>
