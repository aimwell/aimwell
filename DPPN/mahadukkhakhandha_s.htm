  <h2>Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta</h2>

<p>Some monks once visited a Paribbājakārāma near Sāvatthi 
and were told by the Paribbājakas that they, as well as the Buddha, understood 
how to transcend pleasures of sense, visible forms and feelings; what then was 
the difference between themselves and the Buddha. The 
monks repeated this to the Buddha, who said that none save himself knew the 
satisfaction, the perils, and the deliverance which attend pleasures of sense, 
etc.; he then proceeded to explain the pleasures of the senses, the perils that 
attend them, and the deliverance there from, which is to shed all desire and 
appetite therefore. It is the same with feelings. M.i.83ff.</p>
