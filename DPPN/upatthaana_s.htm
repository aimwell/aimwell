<p>1. Upatthāna Sutta.-The Buddha asks 
Ānanda if he considers that every kind of moral practice produces like results. 
Ānanda says they do not, and proceeds to explain his point of view. The Buddha 
agrees with him, and when Ānanda has gone away, tells the monks that though 
Ānanda is yet a learner (sekha), it would not be easy to find his equal in 
insight. A.i.225.</p>
<p>2. Upatthāna Sutta.-Five qualities which 
make an invalid difficult for anyone to look after, and the absence of which 
makes him a good patient. A.iii.143-4.</p>
<p>3. Upatthāna Sutta.-On five qualities 
requisite for an attendant on the sick. A.iii.144-5.</p>
<p>4. Upatthāna Sutta.-Record of a 
conversation between a deva and a monk who dwelt in a forest tract in Kosala. 
During his siesta the monk would often fall asleep, and the deva, wishing his 
welfare and desiring to agitate him, draws near and asks him not to give himself 
up to somnolent habits. The monk replies to the effect that once a man has 
obtained insight by the suppression of desire and lust, there is no need to 
plague himself with unnecessary exertions (S.i.197f).</p>
<p>According to the Commentary (SA.i.232), 
the monk was an arahant. He had far to go to procure food, and when he came 
back, tired out, he would bathe and rest.</p>
