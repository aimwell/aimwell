  <h2>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Name of the first sermon, preached by 
the Buddha, to the <a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiyas</a> at the Migadāya in 
<a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>, on the full-moon 
day of Āsālha. The sutta contains the fundamental principles of the Buddha’s 
teaching — the avoidance of the two extremes of asceticism and luxury and the four Ariyan truths including the Ariyan Eightfold Way.</p>
<p>There was great rejoicing throughout the Cakkavāla at the preaching of the sermon, and at its conclusion Kondañña 
attained to realisation of the Truth — hence his name, 
<a href="annaa_kondanna.htm" title="ay/annaa_kondanna.htm">Aññā-Kondañña</a>. Vin.i.10f; 
the sutta is also given in S.v.420ff; in neither context is the name of the 
sutta given as such; the name occurs only in the Commentaries — e.g., J.i.82; 
DA.i.2; AA.i.69, etc; the Sanskrit version is found in Lal.540 (416)f., and in 
Mtu.iii.330f.</p>
<p>The sermon was later preached by the 
<a href="majjhima_th.htm" title="ma/majjhima_th.htm">Thera Majjhima</a> in the Himālaya country, when eighty thousand crores of beings 
understood the Doctrine (Mhv.xii.41; Dpv.viii.11).  </p>
<p>It was also preached by 
Mahinda in Ceylon in the Nandanavana, when one thousand persons were converted. 
Mhv.xv.200; Dpv.xiv.46, etc.</p>
