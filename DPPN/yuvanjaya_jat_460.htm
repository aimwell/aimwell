  <h2>Yuvañjaya Jātaka (No. 460)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Yuvañjaya, son of 
Sabbadatta, king of Ramma (Benares). He was the eldest of one thousand sons, and 
Yuditthila was his younger brother. After he came of age he was on his way early 
one morning to the park, and saw all around him dew. In the evening, as he 
returned home, the dew drops were no more to be seen. His charioteer explained 
that the sun had dried them up. Reflecting on this, the prince realized the 
impermanence of life and asked his father’s leave to renounce the world.</p>
<p>Both his parents tried to dissuade him but they failed, 
and he and Yudhitthila built a hermitage in the Himālaya, where they became 
ascetics.</p>
<p>Yudhitthila is identified with Ānanda. This story was told 
in reference to the Buddha’s Renunciation, to some monks who marvelled at the 
Buddha’s great sacrifice. J.iv.119ff.; the story of Yuvañjaya (Yudhañjaya) is 
also given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.1; CypA.143ff.</p>
