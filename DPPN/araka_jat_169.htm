  <h2>Araka Jātaka (No. 169)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in a 
brahmin’s family and was named Araka; when he grew up he embraced the religious 
life and lived in the Himālaya as a teacher with a large following. He taught 
his pupils the value of the four brahmavihāras. After his death he was born in 
the Brahma-world and remained there for seven aeons.</p>
<p>The story was told to the monks at 
Jetavana in reference to the Metta Sutta (J.ii.60-2).</p>
