<p><b>1. Sundarī. </b>An aggasāvikā of Anomadassī Buddha. 
J.i.36; Bu.viii.23.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sundarī Therī.</b> She was born in Benares as the 
daughter of the brahmin Sujāta (see Sujāta 9). When her father joined the Order 
at Mithilā and sent his charioteer home, Sundarī, with her mother’s consent, 
gave all away and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course. Then 
one day, with the leave of her teacher, she left Benares, accompanied by a large 
number of nuns, and, visiting the Buddha at Sāvatthi, uttered her “lion’s roar.”</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago she was born in a clansman’s family, 
and seeing Vessabhu Buddha begging for alms, gave him a ladleful of food.</p>
<p>Fifty times she became the wife of Cakkavattis. 
Thig.vss.326-332; ThigA.228f.</p>

<p><b>3. Sundarī, Sundarikā.</b> A 
<a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājikā</a>. She listened 
to the persuasions of her colleagues, the heretics, and would be seen in the 
evenings going towards Jetavana with garlands, perfumes, fruits, etc. When asked 
where she was going, she would reply that she was going to spend the night in 
the Buddha’s cell. She would then spend it in a neighbouring monastery of the 
Paribbājakas and be seen again early in the morning coming from the direction of 
Jetavana. After some days, the heretics hired some villains to kill Sundarī and 
hide her body under a heap of rubbish near Jetavana. Then they raised a hue and 
cry and reported to the king that Sundarī was missing. A search was made, and 
her body was found near the Gandhakuti of the Buddha. Placing the body on a 
litter, they went about the streets of the city crying: “Behold the deeds of the 
Sākyan monks!” As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the 
streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the 
city for alms, and Ānanda even suggested that they should go to another city. </p>
<p>But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running 
away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known. 
The king employed spies, who found the murderers quarrelling among themselves 
after strong drink. They were seized and brought before the king, where they 
confessed their crime. The king sent for the heretics and compelled them to 
retract their accusations against the Buddha and his monks and to confess their 
own wickedness. They were then punished for murder. Ud.iv.8; UdA.256ff.; 
DhA.iii.474f.; SNA.ii.528f.; J.ii.415f</p>
<p>It is said (Ap.i.299; UdA.263) that once the Bodhisatta 
was a pleasure seeker named Munāli. One day he saw Surabhi, a Pacceka Buddha, 
putting on his outer robe just outside the city. Near by a woman was walking, 
and Munāli said in jest, “Look, this recluse is no celibate, but a rake.” It was 
this utterance of the Bodhisatta that brought to the Buddha, as retribution, the 
disgrace in connection with Sundarī.</p>

<a href="manisukara_jat_285.htm" title="ma/manisukara_jat_285.htm">Manisūkara Jātaka</a> 
were preached in this connection.</p>

Tilokasundarī. She married Vikkamabāhu. v.l. Sūnari. Cv.lix.49; for the 
correctness of the name see Cv.Trs.i.213, n.2.</p>
