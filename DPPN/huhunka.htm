<p>The descriptive name of a brahmin who visited the Buddha 
at the Ajapālanigrodha seven days after his Enlightenment and asked him 
questions regarding the true brahmin. The Buddha explained the matter, but made 
no impression on him (Vin.i.2; see also Ud.i.4; UdA.54; cf. Mtu.iii.325). 
</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains that the brahmin was a 
ditthamangalika, filled with haughtiness and wrath, and went about uttering the 
sound “hu-hum.” hence his name.</p>
