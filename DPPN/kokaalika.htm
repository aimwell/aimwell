<p><b>1. Kokālika (Kokāliya).</b>-A monk, one of 
the chief partisans of <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>. Knowing the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> might, he was, at first, 
reluctant to join in Devadatta’s plot against him, but later allowed himself to 
be persuaded on hearing the scheme explained (Vin.ii.196; iii.171). When the 
monks blamed Devadatta for his misdeeds, Kokālika was always ready to defend him 
(Vin.iii.174). When Devadatta’s gains diminished, Kokālika went about praising 
him, his birth, accomplishments and holiness, and many believed him (J.ii.438f). 
He was a great friend of <a href="thulla_nandaa.htm" title="t/thulla_nandaa.htm">Thullanandā</a> (Vin.iv.335). We are told that once he 
expressed resentment because he had never been asked to recite the texts; so one 
day the monks gave him his chance. He ate his favourite soup, and at sundown, 
wearing a blue lower robe and an outer robe of white and carrying an elegantly 
carved fan, he appeared in the assembly. But when he tried to recite sweat 
poured from his body and he was utterly confused. Henceforth the monks knew that 
his claim to learning was but pretence (J.ii.65f).  </p>
<p>Several Jātakas are related 
showing how, in previous births also, Kokālika had come to grief because of his 
fondness for talk and how he had been the accomplice of Devadatta. He is 
identified with  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the jackal in the <a href="daddara_jat_172_304.htm" title="d/daddara_jat_172_304.htm">Daddara Jātaka</a> (ii.65ff) and the
  <a href="sihakotthuka_jat_188.htm" title="s/sihakotthuka_jat_188.htm">Sīhakotthuka 
Jātaka</a> (ii.108); </li>
  <li>the ass in the lion’s skin in the <a href="siihacamma_jat_189.htm" title="s/siihacamma_jat_189.htm">Sīhacamma 
  Jātaka</a> (ii.110); </li>
  <li>the 
talkative tortoise in the <a href="kacchapa_jat_178_215_273.htm" title="ka/kacchapa_jat_178_215_273.htm">Kacchapa 
  Jātaka</a> (ii.175); </li>
  <li>the crow who praised the jackal 
(Devadatta) in the <a href="jambukhaadaka_jat_294.htm" title="j/jambukhaadaka_jat_294.htm">Jambukhādaka Jātaka</a> (ii.438); 
  </li>
  <li>the young cuckoo who lost his life 
because he sang, in the <a href="kokaalika_jat_331.htm" title="ku/kokaalika_jat_331.htm">Kokālika Jātaka</a> (iii.102); 
  </li>
  <li>the tawny-brown brahmin in the 
<a href="takkaariya_jat_481.htm" title="t/takkaariya_jat_481.htm">Takkāriya Jātaka</a> (iv.242; but see Kokālika 2); 
  </li>
  <li>and the wicked deity in the <a href="samuddavanija_jat_466.htm" title="sa/samuddavanija_jat_466.htm">Samuddavāgija 
  Jātaka</a> (iv.166).</li>
</ul>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.473; AA.ii.850; 
SA.i.167) that this Kokālika was a brahmin and a pupil of Devadatta, and that he 
was called Mahā Kokālika to distinguish him from another Kokālika who was 
similarly called Cūla Kokālika (see Kokālika 2). There seems to be great 
confusions in the stories of these two men — if they were really two. In the 
Jātaka Commentary, for instance, the introductory stories of several of the 
Jātakas refer to the Takkāriya Jātaka for details of Kokālika, obviously having 
in mind Devadatta’s partisan; but the introductory story of the Takkāriya Jātaka 
is identical with that related elsewhere of Cūla Kokālika. See also DhA.iv.91f, 
where the story of the talkative tortoise is related to Kokālika of the 
<a href="kokaalika_jat_331.htm" title="ku/kokaalika_jat_331.htm">Kokālika 
Sutta</a> which, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.ii.473) refers to Cūla Kokālika.</p>
<p>In the <a href="vyaggha_jat_272.htm" title="vy/vyaggha_jat_272.htm">Vyaggha Jātaka</a> (J.ii.356) Kokālika is mentioned as having tried to persuade 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> to go 
with him to his own country and as having been very angry when they refused. 
Possibly this story also refers to Cūla Kokālika. See also 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>.</p>

<p><b><A NAME="2">2.</A> Kokālika (Kokāliya)</b>.-A monk, also 
called Cūla Kokālika to distinguish him from Kokālika (1). He was the son of 
Kokāli-setthi of Kokāli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in 
Kokāli. Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy season 
with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence. After the rains, as the 
Elders were about to return, Kokālika informed the inhabitants of their stay and 
blamed them for not showing them hospitality. The townspeople hurried to the 
Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kokālika, who 
had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed. The Elders 
promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied 
by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour. The gifts 
were divided among the monks, Kokālika not receiving a share. He thereupon 
became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place. The people were annoyed, 
and insisted that Kokālika should either bring them back or depart himself. The 
Elders refused to return, and Kokālika, in great anger, sought the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples. 
Having three times accused the Elders of sinful desires, he left 
<a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, but 
boils immediately came out on his body, swelling and bursting. Groaning with 
pain, he fell down at the gate of Jetavana. His spiritual teacher, the anāgāmī 
Brahmā, <a href="tudu.htm" title="t/tudu.htm">Tudu</a>, hearing his cries, came to him and begged him to seek forgiveness 
from the Elders. But he cursed the Brahmā and refused to listen to him. Kokālika 
died and was born in <a href="paduma.htm#10" title="pa/paduma.htm#10">Paduma-niraya</a>. S.i.149ff; A.v.171f; SN.123f; SNA.ii.473f; 
J.iv.242f; AA.ii.850; SA.i.167f; DhA.iv.91f The different sources vary in a few 
minor details; the Jātaka version is the fullest.</p>
<p>It was in reference to this incident 
that the <a href="takkaariya_jat_481.htm" title="t/takkaariya_jat_481.htm">Takkāriya Jātaka</a> was preached.</p>
<p>The Brahmā <a href="sahampati.htm" title="sa/sahampati.htm">Sahampati</a> informed the Buddha 
of Kokālika’s birth in the Paduma-niraya (S.i.151; SN. p.125).</p>
<p>The Kokālika Sutta was preached in 
reference to this Kokālika. See also Kokālika (1).</p>
<p>Kokālika is mentioned as an example of a 
person guilty of misdemeanour regarding the Buddha’s disciples (Tathāgatasāvake 
micchāpatipanno). AA.i.335, 466.</p>
