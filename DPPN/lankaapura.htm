  <p><b>2. Lankāpura Dandanātha. </b>A general of Parakkamabāhu I. He was probably (Cv.lxx.218; 
Cv.Trs.305, n.5) the son of the Lankādhinātha Kitti. We first hear of him as 
having parried the attack of Gajabāhu’s forces, at the pass of Khandigāma. He 
was later sent in command of the expedition against Kulasekhara, to help the 
Pandu king, Parakkama of Madhurā. He landed at the Pandu port of Taladilla and 
occupied Rāmissara. From there he advanced to Kundukāla. The prisoners whom he 
sent to Ceylon were used to help in the restoration of the Ratanavāluka cetiya. 
At Kundukāla, Lankāpura built the fortress of Parakkamapura. He defeated 
Kulasekhara and his numerous allies in several battles, and won over some of his 
allies, such as Ilankiyarāyara, Mālavarāyara and Colagangara, by gifts and 
honours, and captured, among other places, the fortress of Semponmāri. He was 
assisted by Lankāpura Deva and Lankāgiri Sora, the general Gokanna, the 
Kesadhātus Loka and Kitti, and an officer named Jagadvijaya. He then captured 
Mundikkāra and several other fortresses and occupied Rājinā. He subdued the Cola 
and Pandu countries, and is said to have issued coins bearing the name of 
Parakkamabāhu I., while he restored the Pandu kingdom to Vīrapandu. The village 
of Pandu vijaya was founded by the king to, commemorate the victory of Lankāpura. 
The account of Lankāpura’s exploits is found in Cv.lxxvi.76ff.; lxxvii.1ff.</p>
<p>It is curious that no mention is made in the Ceylon 
Chronicles of Lankāpura’s return to Ceylon, nor of any honours bestowed on him 
by the king. South Indian inscriptions relate that Lankāpura was defeated, and 
that his head, with those of his officers, was nailed to the gates of Madhurā.

<p><b>3. Lankāpura</b>. The name seems to have been used 
  also as a title and was conferred on Kadakkuda (Cv.lxxii.39), Rakkha 
  (Cv.lxxv.70), and Deva (Cv.lxxv.130).</p>
