<p>A banker of Sāvatthi. He was rich, but 
he neither enjoyed his wealth himself nor gave it to others; he ate rice-dust 
with sour gruel, wore coarse clothes and went about in an old chariot with a 
parasol of leaves over his head. After death he was born in Roruva-niraya.
</p>
<p>He died heirless and it took seven days 
and seven nights for the king’s men to remove his wealth to the royal treasury.</p>
<p>In reply to a question of Pasenadi, the 
Buddha revealed why Āgantuka had been a miser: in a past birth, while going to 
the king’s court, he had met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhī begging for alms and 
had ordered his servant to give the food prepared for himself (Āgantuka) to the 
Pacceka Buddha. On his way back, seeing the Pacceka Buddha returning with the 
excellent food from the merchant’s house in his alms-bowl, he wished he had 
distributed it among his own servants instead, as they would have done some work 
in return (J.iii.199-300).</p>
<p>The reason for Āgantuka being heirless 
is related in the <a href="mayhaka_jat_390.htm" title="ma/mayhaka_jat_390.htm">Mayhaka Jātaka</a>.</p>
