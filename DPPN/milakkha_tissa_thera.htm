  <h2>Milakkha Tissa Thera</h2>

<p>He was a hunter who lived near Gāmendavāla vihāra in 
Rohana. One day he caught an animal, which he killed and cooked, and then was 
filled with a great thirst. Looking for water, he came to the vihāra. There he 
drank ten pots of water, but his thirst was still unquenched, and while he 
complained bitterly about the absence of water, Cūlapindapātika Tissa Thera 
heard him and, looking about, saw plenty of water. He then knew that the man’s 
evil kamma was asserting itself. The Elder poured water on to the man’s hands, 
but it all dried up. The man, realizing his wickedness, was greatly alarmed, and 
went and set all the captive animals free and destroyed his traps. He then 
returned to the monastery and asked to be ordained. His request was granted, and 
the Elder gave him a formula for meditation. One day, while learning the 
Devadūta Sutta, Tissa wished to know how fierce were the fires of hell, and his 
teacher showed him how one spark of the fire could reduce to ashes a whole heap 
of wood. This induced Tissa to put forth even greater effort, and he spent all 
his time in meditation living sometimes in Cittalapabbata vihāra and sometimes 
in Gāmendavāla vihāra with a wet blanket round his head and his feet in water. 
Then, one day, he heard a novice recite the Arunavatī Sutta and he became an 
anāgāmin, attaining arahantship in due course (AA.i.21f.; SA.ii.199f).</p>
<p>He is quoted as an example of one who strove hard to rid 
himself of sloth and torpor. E.g., AA.i.29; SNA.i.236.</p>
