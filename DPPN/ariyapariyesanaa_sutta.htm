  <h2>Ariyapariyesanā Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached in Sāvatthi in the hermitage of 
the brahmin Rammaka. Some monks expressed to Ānanda their desire to hear a 
discourse from the Buddha, as it was so long since they had heard one. He 
advised them to go to the hermitage of Rammaka where their wishes might be 
fulfilled. The noontide of that same day Ānanda  spent with the Buddha at the 
Pubbārāma in the Migāramātupāsāda and in the evening, after the Buddha had 
bathed in the Pubbakotthaka, Ānanda suggested to him that he might go to 
Rammaka’s hermitage. The Buddha assenting, they went together. The Buddha, 
finding the monks engaged in discussing the Doctrine, waited till their 
discussion was over. Having inquired the topic thereof, he praised them and 
proceeded to tell them of the two quests in the world-the noble and the ignoble. 
He described how he, too, before his Enlightenment, had followed the quest, 
apprenticing himself to various teachers, such as Ālāva-Kālāma and Uddaka 
Rāmaputta, and how, on discovering that they could not give him what he sought, 
he went to Uruvelā and there found the consummate peace of Nibbāna. This 
biographical account is also found in the Mahā-Saccaka, Bodhirājakumāra and 
Sangārava-Suttas. It is in part repeated in the Vinaya and the Digha Nikāya.
</p>
<p>The Sutta then proceeds to give an 
account of the Buddha’s first reluctance to preach, of Sahampati’s intervention, 
of the meeting with the Ājivaka Upaka and the first sermon preached to the 
Pañcavaggiyas. Finally the sutta expounds the pleasures of the senses, the 
dangers therefrom and the freedom and confidence which ensue when one has 
overcome desire (M.i.160-75).</p>
<p>In the Commentary (MA.i.369ff) the sutta 
is called Pāsarāsi, evidently because of the simile found at the end of the 
discourse where the pleasures of the senses are compared to baited traps.</p>
<p>The Atthasālinī quotes it (p.35).</p>
