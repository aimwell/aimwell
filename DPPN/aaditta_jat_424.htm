<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as Bharata, 
King of Roruva, in the country of Sovīra. He was very righteous and much 
beloved, and his chief queen, Samuddavijayā, was wise and full of knowledge.</p>
<p>The king, wishing to give alms to 
Pacceka Buddhas instead of to others far less holy, consulted the queen, and 
acting on her advice, made proclamation to his people that they should keep the 
precepts. He himself observed all holy days and gave great gifts in charity. One 
day he offered flowers to the eastern quarter, and making obeisance, wished that 
any Pacceka Buddha in that quarter might come to accept his alms. His wish not 
being fulfilled, he repeated, on the following days, the same ceremony to the 
other quarters till, on the fourth day, seven Pacceka Buddhas came to him from 
the north where they lived in Nandamūlapabbhāra. The king and queen fed them for 
seven days and gave them robes and all the other requisites of an ascetic. The 
Pacceka Buddhas departed one by one, each expressing his thanks in a stanza and 
exhorting the king and queen to lead pure lives.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Pasenadi’s Asadisadāna, to show that wise men of old also gave gifts to holy 
men, with discretion (J.iii.469-74).</p>
<p>This is evidently the story referred to 
as the Sucira Jātaka in the introduction to the 
<a href="dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm" title="d/dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm">Dasa Brāhmana Jātaka</a> (J.iv.360) 
and again as the Sovīra Jātaka in the introductory story of the 
<a href="sivi_jat_499.htm" title="s/sivi_jat_499.htm">Sivi Jātaka</a> 
(J.iv.401).</p>
