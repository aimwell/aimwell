  <h2>Abhayagiri</h2>

</ul>
<p>A celebrated monastic establishment on 
the north side of Anurādhapura, consisting of a vihāra and a mighty thūpa. Only 
the thūpa now stands. It was built by King Vattagāmani Abhaya on the site of the 
ancient Titthārāma, 217 years, 10 months and 10 days after the founding of the 
Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.78-83). Tradition states that when the king was fleeing 
from the Tamils he passed the Titthārāma on his way, and the Nigantha Giri, who 
then lived there, made insulting remarks about him. The king vowed, if he were 
returned to the throne, to build a vihāra on that spot (Mhv.xxxvii.43-4); he 
fulfilled his vow, and the name of the vihāra was a combination of his own name 
and of that of the Nigantha. The monastery was given in charge of the Thera 
Mahātissa of Kuppikala and of two other monks, Kuppikala having befriended the 
king in his misfortunes.</p>
<p>The vihāra advanced rapidly in wealth 
and in power, but quite soon the monks seceded from the Mahāvihāra fraternity 
because, according to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxxvii.95ff), an incumbent of the 
Mahāvihāra, Mahātissa by name, was expelled from the monastery for frequenting 
lay families. His disciple, Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to Abhayagiri and 
formed a separate faction.</p>
<p>A Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikāya 
Sahgraha (pp.11, 12; also P.L.C.42), states that these dissentients were soon 
after joined by a body of Vajjiputtaka monks from the Pallārāma in India, under 
the leadership of a teacher called Dhammaruci, and the sect which they together 
founded in Ceylon became known as the Dhammaruci Nikāya, with headquarters in 
Abhayagiri.</p>
<p>For quite a long while the two 
fraternities, that of the Mahāvihāra and that of the Abhayagiri, seem to have 
lived in amity, alike enjoying the munificence of patrons (Ibid., 52f.; 
Mhv.xxxv.20, 57, 119-22; xxxvi.7-14). Thus, Gajabāhukagāmani raised the height 
of Abhayuttara-thūpa (as the thūpa at Abhayagiri seems to have been called) and 
made the Gāmanitissa-tank to be used for the cultivation of land for the 
maintenance of the vihara (Ibid., xxxv.119-22); Kanitthatissa built a splendid 
structure in the same vihāra for the Thera Mahānāga; it was called the 
Ratanapāsāda (xxxvi.7, 8.).</p>
<p>But in the reign of Vohārakatissa, the 
Abhayagiri monks openly adopted the heretical Vaitulya Pitaka (of the 
Mahāyānists see Mhv. trans. 259, n.2). An inquiry was held by the king with the 
help of his minister Kapila, the heretical books were burnt and the monks of 
Abhayagiri disgraced (Mhv.xxxvi.40-1).</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, however, the heretics 
won over the king Mahāsena to their side and destroyed the establishment of the 
Mahāvihāra, carrying away all the materials to Abhayagiri (P.L.C. 53; 
Mhv.xxxvii.10-16). Later, Mahāsena repented of his ways, burnt the books of the 
Abhayagiri monks and transferred his patronage to the Mahāvihāra. But the 
Abhayagiri fraternity must soon have recovered its prestige, for we find 
Mahāsena’s successor, Sirimeghavanna, planting a bodhi tree (called Tissavasabha) 
(Cv.trans. i.9, n.3) in Abhayagiri and surrounding it with a stone terrace 
((Cv.xxxvii.91)). A few years later both Mahānāma (409-31) and his queen became 
active supporters of Abhaya Giri (Cv.xxxvii.212). Dhātusena is stated to have 
enlarged the Abhayuttara-vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.61), and Silākāla is credited with 
several benefactions to the vihāra and its bodhi tree (Cv.xli.31-2); Mahānāga 
gave the weaver’s village of Jambela to the Uttaravihāra (another name for 
Abhayagiri; see Cv. trans. i.8, n.2; 61, n.6.); Aggabodhi I. built a 
bathing-tank there (Cv.xlii.28), while his successor, Aggabodhi II., built the 
Dāthāggabodhi house, so called after himself and his queen (Cv.xlii.63-5).</p>
<p>In the monastery at Abhayagiri there 
seems to have been a stone image of the Buddha, referred to under various names, 
Silāsambuddha, Kālasela, Kālasatthā, Silāsatthā and Silāmayamuninda. Cv.xxxix.7; 
xxxviii.65; 61.2; see also vv.51, 77, 87. There was also in Abhayagiri another 
image called the Abhiseka (q.v.). </p>
<p>It was evidently held peculiarly sacred. 
Buddhadāsa placed a nāgamani in its eye (Cv.xxxvii.123); this was soon lost, and 
we find Dhātusena replacing it, adorning and decorating the statue in various 
ways (For details see Cv.xxxviii.62ff). Silāmeghavanna had it restored and 
redecorated and made provision for its maintenance (Cv.xliv.68). The same king, 
we are told, attempted to carry out a reform of the Abhayagiri monks, but this 
attempt ultimately brought disaster on him (Cv.xliv.75ff). Jetthatissa gave to 
the vihāra the village of Mahādāragiri (Cv.xliv.96). Dāthopatissa built the 
Kappūra-parivena attached to the vihāra, and also a monastery Tiputthulla, 
encroaching on the precincts of the Mahāvihāra, notwithstanding the protests of 
the monks belonging to the</p>
<p>Latter (Cv.xlv.29ff). Aggabodhi VII, 
added the Sabhattudesabhoga (Cv.xlviii.64), and Mahinda II. the 
Mahālekha-parivena as well as the many-storeyed Ratanapāsāda with its costly 
ornamentation (Cv.xlviii.135-40; see also Geiger’s trans. 123, n.2).</p>
<p>Sena I. built the Virankurārāma and gave 
it to the Mahāsanghikas (Cv.l.68-9), while his consort, Sanghā, erected a 
dwelling house, Mahindasena (Cv.l.79), and his courtier, Uttara, yet another 
dwelling house, called Uttarasena, for the maintenance of which he provided. Two 
other courtiers, Vajira and Rakkhasa, built two dwelling houses, called 
respectively Vajirasenaka and Rakkhasa (Cv.l.83).</p>
<p>In the reign of Sena II. the Pamsukulika 
monks, who till then had evidently lived in Abhayagiri (Cv. trans. i.108, n.1), 
separated and formed special groups. Sanghā, queen of Udaya II., erected and 
endowed the building known as the Sanghasenapabbata (Cv.li.86-7). Kassapa IV. 
built a pāsāda bearing his name and assigned to it a village (Cv.lii.13; Cv.trs. 
i.162, n.4), while his successor, Kassapa V., erected the Bhandikā-parivena and 
the Silāmeghapabbata, endowing each with a village (Cv.lii.58-9).</p>
<p>Sena III. spent 40,000 kahāpanas for a 
stone paving round the cetiya. The Abhayagiri monks befriended both Vijayabāhu 
I. (then known as Kitti) and his brother, and out of gratitude Vijayabāhu built 
the Uttaramūla-parivena, which was probably attached to the vihara itself 
(Cv.lvii.18, 23).</p>
<p>In the reign of Parakkamabāhu I., when 
that monarch had established himself on the throne, it is said that he tried to 
reform the monks of the Abhayagiri, but he found the task hopeless 
(Cv.lxxviii.21ff). He found that the Abhayagiri-thūpa had been destroyed by the 
vandalism of the Tamils, and he had it restored to a height of 160 cubits 
(Cv.lxxviii.98). When Anurādhapura was finally abandoned, Abhayagiri fell into 
ruin and decay, the monastery being completely destroyed.</p>
<p>It is clear that even at the outset 
there was considerable rivalry between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the 
Mahāvihāra. The rivalry seems originally to have been mainly personal, but it 
later developed into differences in doctrinal opinion. Of the exact nature of 
these latter we have no information, owing, chiefly, to the book-burnings 
carried out by pious kings in the excess of their zeal for the purity of the 
Faith. For the same reason we are unable to ascertain what part, if any, the 
Abhayagiri fraternity played in literary activity. It has been suggested, 
however, that both the Jātakatthakathā (P.L.C.124, 125) and the 
Sahassavatthuppakarana (P.L.C.128), another compilation of tales, were the work 
of the Abhayagiri monks.</p>
<p>Fa-Hsien evidently spent the two years 
of his stay in Ceylon with the Abhayagiri fraternity because the books he took 
away with him were those of the unorthodox schools. According to him, there 
were, at this time, 5,000 monks in Abhayagiri (Fa Hsien’s Travels, 67ff).</p>
<p>In the chronicles Abhayagiri is referred 
to under several names Abhayuttara, Abhayavihāra, Abhayācala and Uttaravihāra.</p>
