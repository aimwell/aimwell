<p>The Bodhisatta, named <a href="suppara.htm" title="s/suppara.htm">Suppāraka</a>, was once a master mariner of
<a href="bharukaccha.htm" title="b/bharukaccha.htm">Bhārukaccha</a>. 
His eyes were injured by the salt water and he went completely blind. The king 
appointed him valuer and assessor. One day an elephant was brought before him 
which was designed to be the state elephant, but, feeling it over with his 
hands, he condemned it, saying that its dam had dropped it in its youth, 
injuring its hind feet. He similarly condemned a horse, a chariot, and a blanket 
for various reasons, all these things having been designed for royal use. All 
his judgments were verified by the king and found to be correct; but he only 
gave Suppāraka eight pieces of money each time, and so Suppāraka left his 
service in disgust.</p>
<p>Some merchants had commissioned a ship, and, while 
searching for a captain, thought of Suppāraka. When Suppāraka refused, saying 
that he was blind, they replied that blind he might be, but no ship could 
founder if he were at the helm. After seven days the ship was caught in a storm 
and Suppāraka drove her through various oceans — Khummāla, Aggimāla, 
Dadhimāla, Nīlavannakusamāla, Nalamāla and Valabhāmukha. When he arrived at the 
last sea he saw that there was no means of rescuing the ship, and so performed 
an act of Truth. In one day the, ship sailed back to 
<a href="bharukaccha.htm" title="b/bharukaccha.htm">Bhārukaccha</a>.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s 
perfection of wisdom. J.iv.136-47; cf. Sapāraga Jātaka in the Jātakamālā (No. 
14).</p>
