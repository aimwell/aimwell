<p><b>1. Sīvaka. </b>A Yakkha who helped <a href="anaathapindika.htm" title="ay/anaathapindika.htm">Anāthapindika</a> to 
find the Buddha at <a href="sitavana.htm" title="s/sitavana.htm">Sītavana</a> (Vin.ii.155f; S.i.211). He is mentioned among the 
chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in time of need 
(D.iii.205).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sīvaka.</b> See Moliya-Sīvaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sīvaka. </b>The physician of King Sivi. See the 
<a href="sivi_jat_499.htm" title="s/sivi_jat_499.htm">Sivi 
Jātaka</a>. He is identified with Ānanda. J.iv.412.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sīvaka Thera.</b> The nephew of Vanavaccha. When 
Vanavaccha’s sister heard that he had left the world and was living in the 
forest, she sent her son Sīvaka to be ordained under the Elder and to wait upon 
him. He lived in the forest with his uncle, and one day, while on his way to the 
village, fell very ill. The Elder, on finding that he did not return, went in 
search of him, and, finding him ill, tended him; but as dawn drew near, he 
suggested that they should both return to the forest as he had never before 
stayed in the village since joining the Order. Sīvaka agreed, and entered the 
forest leaning on his uncle’s arm. There Sīvaka won arahantship.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago he had seen Vessabhū Buddha in the 
forest and offered him a kāsumārika fruit (Thag.vs.14; ThagA.i.60f). He is 
probably identical with Kāsumāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.445.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sīvaka Thera. </b>He belonged to a brahmin family of 
Rājagaha, and, when he had acquired a good education, became a Paribbājaka. Then 
he heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and became an arahant.</p>
<p>Ninety one kappas ago he had given Vipassī Buddha a bowl 
of boiled rice (kummāsa) (Thag.vss.183-4; ThagA.i.307f). He is evidently 
identical with Kummāsadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.415.</p>
