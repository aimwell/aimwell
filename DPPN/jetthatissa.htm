<p>1. Jetthatissa I.-King of Ceylon (323-33 
A.C.), elder son of Gothābhaya, the younger being Mahāsena. He slew all the 
ministers who were disloyal to his father and earned the title of “The Cruel.” 
He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda to a height of seven storeys and renamed it the 
Manipāsāda, from the costly jewels he offered in it. He also built the 
Pācīnatissapabbata-vihāra and the Ālambagāma tank. Mhv.xxxvi.118ff; Dpv.xxii.61, 
66.</p>
<p>2. Jetthatissa II.-King of Ceylon, 
brother (?) and successor of Sirimeghavanna. He ruled for nine years and was a 
very skilful carver in ivory. Cv.xxxvii.100-4; Cv. Trs.1.9, n.1.</p>
<p>3. Jetthatissa.-Son of King Sanghatissa. 
When Moggallāna III. usurped the throne Jetthatissa fled to the Malaya country. 
From there he helped Asiggāhaka Silāmeghavanna in his fight with Moggallāna, but 
on discovering that Silāmeghavanna wished to kill him also, he fled once more to 
Malaya. Later, he made his headquarters at Aritthapabbata, and from there led an 
army against Aggabodhi III., who was then on the throne. Aggabodhi fled to 
Jambudīpa, and Jetthatissa became king as Jetthatissa III. He reigned for only 
five months, during which time he did several meritorious works. Aggabodhi 
returned with an army, and in the battle which followed Jetthatissa slew himself 
at the sight of his army suffering defeat. His queen entered the Order and 
became proficient in the Abhidhamma. Cv.xliv.28, 55, 61, 70, 86-106.</p>
