</ul>
<p>Twenty-seventh of the Digha Nikāya 
(D.iii.80f). It is a kind of Buddhist book of Genesis, dealing, among other 
things, with the evolution of the world, of man and of society. The pretensions 
of the brahmins to be the legitimate heirs of Brahma are examined and rejected; 
righteousness is declared to be above lineage. (For a summary of the sutta see 
Dial. i.105f. Cf: Madhura Sutta). </p>
<p>It was preached to Vāsettha and 
Bhāradvāja at the Pubbārāma.</p>
<p>The larger portion of this sutta (from 
the beginning of the genesis part to the election of the first king) is found in 
the Mahāvastu (i.338-48).</p>
