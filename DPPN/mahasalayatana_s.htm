<h2>Mahāsalayatana, Mahisalāyatanika Sutta</h2>
<p>The Buddha instructs the monks on the necessity of 
acquiring the right kind of knowledge of the sense organs, their objects, their 
perception, their contact and the feelings arising there from. Such knowledge 
enables a monk to traverse the Noble Eightfold Path to its perfected development 
and to the realization of transcendent knowledge, which is understanding and 
deliverance. M.iii.287<span lang="en-us">-90.</p>
