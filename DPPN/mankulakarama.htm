<p>A monastery in Sunāparanta where Punna Thera lived (q.v.) 
and where the Buddha visited him. Near by was a village of merchants where Punna 
went for his alms and where lived his brother Culla Punna. After the merchants 
had been saved from death by the intervention of Punna, they gave him a share of 
the red sandalwood they had obtained in the course of their travels, and with 
this they built a mandalamāla in the vihāra and dedicated it to the Buddha. The 
Buddha lived there for seven days. SA.iii.15ff.</p>
