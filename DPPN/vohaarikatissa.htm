<p>King Of Ceylon (269 91 A.C.). </p>
<p>He was the son of Sirināga and his name was Tissa. 
</p>
<p>He was called “Vohārika” because of his knowledge of law 
and tradition; he repealed the penalty of bodily injury. </p>
<p>He patronized Deva Thera of Kappukagāma and Mahātissa of 
Anurārāma. </p>
<p>He built the Sattapannakapāsāda, and erected parasols on 
eight thūpas and walls round six vihāras. (For details see Mhv.xxxvi.33f ).
</p>
<p>On days when the Ariyavamsa was being read, he held 
almsgiving throughout Ceylon. </p>
<p>He suppressed the Vetulya heresy with the help of his 
minister Kapila. He was killed by his brother, Abhayanāga. Mhv.xxxvi.27ff.</p>
