  <h2>Dabba-Mallaputta Thera</h2>

<p>An arahant. He was born at Anupiya in a 
family of the <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallas</a> (Kusinārā, says the Apadāna). As a child of seven he saw 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> who was visiting in the Malla country, and he asked his grandmother 
(his mother having died at his birth) if he might join the Order under the 
Buddha. She brought him to the Buddha and the boy became an arahant in the 
Tonsure-hall. He returned with the Buddha to <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> where, with the Buddha’s 
sanction, and wishing to be of service to the Order, he took upon himself the 
task of appointing night’s-lodgings to travelling monks and of directing them to 
meals. He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and 
his fame spread far and wide. Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his 
skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote 
from Rājagaha; Dabba would “burst into flame” and walk ahead of them, with his 
finger burning to light them on the way. It was the sight of Dabba on one of 
these journeys which led to a slave-woman, <a href="punnaa.htm" title="pu/punnaa.htm">Punnā</a>, being visited by the Buddha, 
resulting in her becoming a Sotāpanna (DhA.iii.321ff).</p>
<p>It once happened that meals were 
allotted by Dabba to the <a href="mettiyabhummajaka.htm" title="me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka.htm">Mettiya-Bhummajakā</a> at the house of a rich man, who, 
discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow. The 
Mettiya-Bhummajakā were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended 
to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyā, to accuse Dabba of 
having seduced her. The charge was investigated, Mettiyā was expelled, and 
Dabba’s fame increased (Thag.v.5; Vin.ii.74ff; iii.158f, 166f, iv.37f; 
Sp.iii.598f). The Mettiya-Bhummajakā persuaded the Licchavi, 
<a href="vaddha.htm" title="va/vaddha.htm">Vaddha</a>, to make a 
similar charge against Dabba regarding his wife (Vin.ii.124f). The 
<a href="tandulanaali_jat_5.htm" title="t/tandulanaali_jat_5.htm">Tandulanāli 
Jātaka</a> (J.i.123f ) mentions another dispute, where
<a href="laludayi_th.htm" title="l/laludayi_th.htm">Lāludāyi</a> charges Dabba with 
not performing his duties conscientiously. Thereupon Lāludāyi was appointed to 
the task, but proved a failure.</p>
<p>Dabba was given the rank of chief of 
those who appointed lodgings (senāsanapaññāpakānam) (A.i.24) and was given the 
upasampadā ordination when only seven years old. He was called Dabba because he 
was said to be born of his mother while she was being burnt in the funeral pyre; 
when the flames were extinguished, the child was found lying on one of the posts 
of the pyre (dabbatthambhe) (ThagA.i.41; AA.i.152f).</p>
<p>He was a setthiputta in Hamsavatī in the 
time of Padumuttara Buddha, and it was then that he conceived the desire for the 
rank of chief apportioner of lodgings. One hundred and three times he became 
king among devas and one hundred and five times king of men. In the time of 
Vipassī Buddha he spoke calumny about an arahant Thera, hence the conspiracy 
against him by the Mettiya-Bhummajakā. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he, with 
six others, went to the top of a hill, determined not to return till they had 
accomplished their purpose, but five of them died before this came to pass. The 
other four were Pukkusāti, Sabhiya, Bāhiya, and Kumārakassapa (DhA.ii.212; 
ThagA.i.44ff; Ap.ii.471f; UdA.81; Sp.ii.578f).</p>
<p>Dabba evidently died young. The Udana (Ud.viii.9; 
UdA.431f ) contains an account of his death. One day, 
returning from his alms rounds in Rājagaha, he saw that he had but a short while 
yet to live. He went, therefore, to the Buddha and, with his leave, showed 
various iddhi-powers and passed away.</p>
