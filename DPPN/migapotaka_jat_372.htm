</ul>
<p>Once a certain ascetic in Himav훮 adopted a young deer 
which had lost its dam. The deer grew up most comely but died from over eating. 
The ascetic lamented greatly till Sakka (the Bodhisatta) appeared before him and 
pointed out the folly of his sorrow.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an old man of S훮vatthi 
who looked after a novice very devotedly. The novice died and the old man 
abandoned himself to grief. The characters in both stories were identical.
