<p>A king of Benares, so called from his great fondness for 
ornaments. He developed the habit of sleeping by day and suffered from 
biliousness. This made him realize his folly, and, developing insight, he became 
a Pacceka Buddha. His udānagāthā is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta. SN. vs. 
59; SNA.i.111.</p>
