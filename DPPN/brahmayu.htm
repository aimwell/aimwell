<p>A brahmin foremost in Mithilā in his knowledge of the 
Vedas. </p>
<p>On hearing of the Buddha at the age of one hundred and 
twenty, he sent his pupil Uttara to discover if the Buddha had on his body the 
marks of a Mahāpurisa. Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the 
thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to 
this end, followed him about for seven months. He then returned to Brahmāyu and 
told him of the result of his investigations. Brahmāyu folded his palms 
reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha. Soon after, the Buddha came to 
Mithilā and took up his residence in the Makhādeva ambavana. Brahmāyu, having 
sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha. </p>
<p>It is said that all those present rose to greet him, but 
Brahmāyu signed to them to be seated. He satisfied any remaining doubts he had 
as to the marks on the Buddha’s body and then proceeded to ask him questions on 
various topics. At the end of the discussion he fell at the Buddha’s feet, 
stroking them and proclaiming his name. The Buddha asked him to compose himself, 
and preached to him on “progressive” discourse. Brahmāyu invited the Buddha and 
his monks to his house, where he entertained them for a week. His death occurred 
not long after, and the Buddha, when told of it, said that Brahmāyu had become 
an Anāgāmī (M.ii.133ff). Brahmāyu’s salutation of the Buddha is described as 
panipāta. ItvA.177.</p>
