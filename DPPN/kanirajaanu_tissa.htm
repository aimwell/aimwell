<p>King of Ceylon (A.D.89-92). He slew his 
elder brother Āmandagāmani Abhaya and occupied the throne. He once gave judgment 
in a lawsuit concerning the uposatha-house in the Cetiyagiri vihāra, and sixty 
monks who were found guilty of treason against him were captured by his orders 
and flung into a cave called Kanira. Hence, probably, his name. Mhv.xxxv.9ff; 
MT.640; Dpv.xx.38.</p>
