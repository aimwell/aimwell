<p>1. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Moggallāna II. 
and king of Ceylon from 656 A.C. The length of his reign is uncertain; he was 
slain by Mahānāga (Cv.xli.65-92; see also Cv.Trs.i.61, n.2). Rūpavatī, queen of 
Parakkamabāhu I., was probably a lineal descendant of this king. Cv.lxxiii.136, 
142.</p>
<p>2. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mittā, sister 
of Vijayabāhu I. and of a Pandu king (Pandurājā). Mānābharana and Sirivallabha 
were his brothers, and be married Vijayabāhu’s daughter, Lokanāthā (Cv.lix.42, 
44). After Vijayabāhu’s death, Kittisirimegha ruled over the province of 
Dvādasasahassaka at Mahānāgahula with Mittā and Jayabāhu I. (Cv.lxi.22-7). After 
the death of Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha took over also his province of Rohana 
(Cv.lxiii.2). When Gajabāhu succeeded Vikkamabāhu II. Kittisirimegha fought 
against him, but was defeated by the king’s officer Gokanna, and retired to his 
own province, where he was later joined by Parakkamabāhu at Sankhanāyakatthalī 
(Cv.lxiii.20, 34, 43). Parakkama stayed with him, being adopted as his son, and 
his upanayana was held under Kittisirimegha’s orders at Baddalatthalī 
(Cv.lxiv.18, 25, 36). When, however, Parakkama escaped from the prince’s 
protection, he sent an army to capture him, but without success (Cv.lxvi.57ff). 
Later, Parakkama himself went to see Kittisirimegha in the company of his mother 
Ratnāvalī, and Kittisirimegha gave orders to his followers to regard the prince 
as their master. He himself died soon after (Cv.xvii.16, 55, 60, 83, 87).</p>
<p>3. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mānābharana by 
his second queen Pabhāvatī. His grandfather was Sirivallabha (Cv.lxiv.24). His 
father, on his deathbed, repented of the harm he had done to the Buddha’s 
religion and asked his son to do reparation by joining Parakkamabāhu I. The 
latter, on hearing this, sent for Kittisirimegha and made him a member of his 
court (Cv.lxxii.303, 311).</p>
