<p><b>1. Samiddhi Thera.</b> He belonged to a householder’s 
family of Rājagaha. From the time of his birth his family prospered, and he 
himself was happy and good, hence his name. He was present at the meeting 
between the Buddha and Bimbisāra, and was so impressed thereby that he joined 
the Order. Once, while he was at the Tapodārāma musing on his good fortune as a 
monk, Māra tried to terrify him. Samiddhi told the Buddha of this, but the 
Buddha asked him to stay on where he was. He obeyed, and soon afterwards won 
arahantship. He then declared his aññā in a verse (Thag.vs.46), and Māra retired 
discomfited. This episode is also given at S.i.119 f, but the place mentioned is 
not the Tapodārāma, but Silāvati.</p>
<p>In the past he met Siddhattha Buddha, to whom he gave some 
flowers with stalks, which he picked with the help of his bow and arrow. 
Fifty-one kappas ago he was a king named Jutindhara (ThagA.i.117f). He is 
probably identical with Salalamāliya of the Apadāna (Ap.i.206).</p>
<p>Once when Samiddhi was drying himself after bathing in the 
Tapodā, a Deva approached and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. 
Samiddhi confessed ignorance, and the Deva asked him to learn it from the 
Buddha. This he did from a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha, which 
Mahā Kaccāna later enlarged into the Mahā Kaccāna-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (q.v.) 
(M.iii.192f). A conversation between Potaliputta and Samiddhi, three years after 
the latter had joined the Order, led to the preaching of the Mahākammavibhanga 
Sutta (q.v. ) (M.iii.207). In the sutta the Buddha speaks of Samiddhi as 
moghapurisa, and Samiddhi is also teased by Potaliputta for pretending to 
expound the Dhamma after being only three years in the Order. According to the 
Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.799), Samiddhi was a pupil (saddhivihārika) of 
Sāriputta, and the Anguttara (A.iv.385f ) contains a record of a lesson given by 
Sāriputta to Samiddhi regarding sankappavitakkas. See also the Samīddhi Jātaka 
and the Samīddhi Sutta (2).</p>
