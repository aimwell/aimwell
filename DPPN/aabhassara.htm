<p>A Brahma-world where live radiant devas 
from whose bodies rays of light are emitted, like lightning. It belongs to the 
Rūpaloka and is in the plane of second jhāna (Abhs. v.3; Compendium 138, n.4). 
The devas living there subsist on joy (pītibhakkha) (S.i.114.; DhA.iii.258; 
J.vi.55). Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a 
person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition 
(A.ii.127; but see Abhs. v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas). 
From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying “aho sukham, aho sukham.” 
This sound is the best of sounds. These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena 
abhisaññā parisaññā) (A.iii.202; D. iii.219). Their world forms the third 
station of consciousness (viññānatthiti), they are of uniform body, but their 
perceptions are diverse (ekattakāyā nānat-tasaññino) (A.iv.40, 401; D.ii.69; 
D.iii.253). During the periods of the development of the world many beings are 
born in the Abhassara realm and they are then called the highest of the devas, 
yet even they change their condition (A.v.60). In lists of devas (E.g., M.i.289) 
they are given below the Appamānābhā and above the Subhā. </p>
<p>Bodhisattas are sometimes born in the 
Ābhassara world (AA.i.73; J.i.406, 473; M.i.329; , MA.i.553; SA.i.162), but they 
are never born in Arūpa worlds even when they have developed Arūpa-jhānas. Baka 
Brahmā was born in Ābhassara after having passed through Vehapphala and 
Subhakinna, and it was then that he conceived the belief that he was eternal.</p>
<p>The Buddha visited him and convinced him 
of the error of his belief (J.iii.359). When the universe is dissolved after the 
lapse of a long epoch and is again evolved, beings are mostly born in the 
Ābhassara world. When, sooner or later, the world begins to re-evolve (vivattati), 
the Brahmavimāna appears, but it is empty. Then some being or other, either 
because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves 
the Ābhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavimāna. Others follow his 
example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks 
of himself as Brahmā, the eternal, etc. (D.iii.29).</p>
<p>When inhabitants of the Ābhassara-world 
are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had 
in the brahma-world itself. As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities 
and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For 
details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253). Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.865) says that their 
birth on earth is opapātika (by spontaneous regeneration) and they are mind-born 
(manomaya).</p>
<p>On the occasions when the world is 
destroyed by fire, the fire spread up to the Ābhassara-world; when by water, the 
water rises to the Subhakinna; when by wind, the wind reaches to the Vehapphala 
(CypA.9).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.i.29; 
VibhA.520; cp. DA.ii.510), the Ābhassaras are so called because radiance spreads 
from their bodies in all directions, like flames from a torch (dandadīpikāya 
acci viya etesam sarīrato ābhā chijjitvā chijjitvā patantī viya sarati visaratī 
ti Abhassarā).</p>
<p>According to the scholiast of the 
Candābha Jātaka (q.v.), beings who meditate on the Sun and Moon are born in this 
world. The Moon appears at the wish of the Abhassara Brahmās. See Candimā.</p>
