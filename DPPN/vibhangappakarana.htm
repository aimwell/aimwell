<p>One of the seven books of the Abhidhamma-Pitaka; it is 
generally placed second in the list (E.g., Mil. 12). It deals in a general way 
with the different categories and formulas given in the Dhammasanganī, though 
different methods of treatment are used. The book is divided into eighteen 
chapters, each of which is called a Vibhanga. Each chapter has three portions: 
Suttantabhājaniya, Abhidhammabhājaniya and Paññāpucchaka or list of questions. 
The Commentary to the Vibhanga is called Sammohavinodanī</p>
