<h4>1. Nirodha Sutta</h4>
<p>Sāriputta tells Ānanda that he has attained to a state of 
cessation of perception and feeling. S.iii.238.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nirodha Sutta</h4>
<p>Sāriputta tells the monks that one, who has achieved 
virtue, concentration and insight, may both enter the cessation of perception 
and feeling and also emerge there from. Udāyin (Lāludāyī), who is present, 
contradicts this three times, but none upbraids him. Sāriputta’s words are 
repeated before the Buddha, and Udāyin acts similarly. The Buddha rebukes Ānanda 
for not admonishing Udāyin. Later, the Buddha talks of the matter to Upavāna and 
tells him of five qualities which a monk should possess. A.iii.192ff.</p>
