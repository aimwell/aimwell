  <h2>Asokārāma</h2>

</ul>
<p>A monastery in Pātaliputta, built by 
Asoka and finished in three years. It was there that the king’s brother Tissa 
was ordained. When the monks had refused for seven years to hold the uposatha 
ceremony, Asoka sent his minister to summon them to the Asokārāma. There the 
misguided minister beheaded several theras who refused to obey his orders. It 
was there that Moggaliputta Tissa held the Third Council and made a compilation 
of the Dhamma (Mhv.v.80, 163, 174, 236, 276).</p>
<p>Asoka used to feed 60,000 monks daily at 
the Asokārāma.</p>
<p>On the day of the foundation of the Mahā 
Thūpa in Anurādhapura, sixty thousand monks under Mittinna came from Asokārāma 
(Mhv.xxix.36). There, too, lived Dhammarakkhita, the teacher of Nāgasena 
(Mil.16-18).</p>
<p>Indagutta Thera was appointed by the 
king to superintend the building of the vihāra (Sp.i.48-9).</p>
<p>It was from Asokārāma that Mahinda set 
out on his mission to Ceylon (Sp.i.69). </p>
