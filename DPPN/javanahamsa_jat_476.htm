<p>The Bodhisatta was once king of ninety 
thousand geese in Cittakūta. The king of Benares, seeing him, took a great fancy 
to him and did him honour, desiring his friendship. When the king went to 
Anotatta, the Bodhisatta did him similar honour and friendship was established 
between them. One day, two of the young geese, in spite of the advice of the 
Bodhisatta, wished to try their speed against the sun. Their king, wishing to 
save them from death, went with them, rescuing them when tired. Then he himself 
raced the sun and was victorious, arriving at the king’s palace. The king, 
hearing of this, wished to see an exhibition of the Bodhisatta’s powers of 
speed, and his desire was granted. When asked whether anything was fleeter than 
himself, the king of the geese replied that the decay of the elements of life 
was a thousand-fold speedier. He thereupon preached the moral law to the king. 
Ānanda is identified with the king and Sāriputta and Moggallāna with the two 
geese. J.iv.211-8.</p>
