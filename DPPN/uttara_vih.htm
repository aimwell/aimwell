<p>Another name for the Abhayagiri-Vihāra 
(q.v.). The inhabitants of the Uttaravihāra seem to have kept a chronicle, in 
the same way as did the dwellers of the Mahā-Vihāra. This is often referred to 
in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, as the Uttara-Vihāra-atthakathā and the Uttara-Vihāra-Mahāvamsa. 
Judging from the quotations from this work given in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, the 
Uttara-Vihāra chronicle seems to have differed from the tradition of the 
Mahā-Vihāra more in detail than in general construction. It is not possible to 
say whether it contained exegetical matter on the Pāli Canon besides matters of 
historical interest. For a detailed account of the work see Geiger: The 
Dīpavamsa and the Mahāvamsa, pp.50ff; also my edition of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā.</p>
