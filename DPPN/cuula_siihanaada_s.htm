  <h2>Cūla-Sīhanāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Followers of the Buddha excel those of 
other teachers in faith in their teacher, faith in his Doctrine, strict 
observance of the sīlas and in love towards their fellow-believers, laymen and 
monks. </p>
<p>Their goal is the goal of men without 
cravings, without attachments, without facetiousness, without combative spirit, 
without obsessions. Their Doctrine is perfect, rightly revealed, rightly 
preached. M.i.63ff.</p>
