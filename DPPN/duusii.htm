  <h2>Dūsī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Name of Māra in the time of Kakusandha 
Buddha. He was, in that birth, son of Kālī, sister of Moggallāna. He first 
incited the brahmin householders to revile Kakusandha’s monks, chief of whom 
were Vidhura and Sañjīva; when that effort failed owing to the thoughts of 
goodwill, pity, sympathy and equanimity, developed by the monks, he next incited 
the brahmins to show great honour to the monks, hoping, in that way, to tempt 
them. But, owing to the intervention of Kakusandha, Dūsī’s attempts failed and 
he was born in the Mahā Niraya. </p>
<p>The story is given in the Māratajjaniya 
Sutta (M.i.333ff; also Thag.1187-91; ThagA.ii.183). </p>
<p>Dūsī is mentioned as having died early 
because his life was cut off by kamma (Vsm.229).</p>
