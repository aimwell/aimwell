<p>A famous stone image in Anurādhapura, evidently held in 
great reverence. It was originally in the Abhayuttara vihāra, and Buddhadāsa 
placed a Nāga-gem as one of its eyes (Cv.xxxvii.123); but this was lost, and 
then Dhātusena had a pair of costly eyes made (Cv.xxxviii.62).  </p>
<p>It was referred 
to under various names: Silāsatthā, Silāmayamuninda, Kālasela-satthā, etc. Sena 
II. found the temple containing the image in ruins and had it repaired 
(Cv.li.77), while his queen Sanghā placed on the image a dark blue diadem 
(Cv.li.87).</p>
