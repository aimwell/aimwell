<h4>1. Nārada Buddha</h4>
<p>The ninth of the twenty four Buddhas, 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>he was born in the Dhanañjaya park at Dhaññavatī, 
</li>
  <li>his father being king Sudeva and his mother Anomā.
</li>
  <li>For nine thousand years he lived as a layman in three 
palaces: Jitā, Vijjtā and Abhirāmā (BuA. calls them Vijita, Vijitāvī and 
Jitābhirāma). </li>
  <li>His wife was Jitasenā (v.l. Vijitasenā), and 
  </li>
  <li>his son Nanduttara. </li>
  <li>He made his Renunciation on foot accompanied by his 
  retinue. </li>
  <li>He practised austerities for only seven days, then, 
  </li>
  <li>having 
accepted a meal of milk rice from his wife, </li>
  <li>he sat at the foot of a mahāsona 
tree, </li>
  <li>on grass given by the parkkeeper Sudassana. 
  </li>
  <li>His first sermon was preached 
in the Dhanañjaya Park. </li>
  <li>His body was eighty eight cubits high, and </li>
  <li>his aura 
always spread round him to a distance of one league. </li>
  <li>He died at the age of 
ninety thousand years in Sudassana, and </li>
  <li>his thupa was four leagues high. 
  </li>
  <li>Bhaddasāla and Jjtamitta were his chief monks 
  </li>
  <li>and Uttarā and Phaggunā his chief 
nuns. </li>
  <li>Vāsettha was his personal attendant, and  </li>
  <li>chief among his 
patrons were Uggarinda and Vasabha, and Indavarī and Candī.  </li>
  <li>Among his converts 
were the Nāga kings Mahādona and Veracona.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was a Jatila in 
Himavā, and the Buddha, with his followers, visited his hermitage, where they 
were fed for seven days and received gifts of red sandalwood. Bu.x.1ff.; 
BuA.151ff.; J.i.35f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nārada</h4>
<p>The personal attendant of Sujāta Buddha. Bu.xiii.25.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nārada</h4>
<p>A Brahmin in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, who praised 
the Buddha in three stanzas. He was a former birth of Nāgita (or Atthasandassaka) 
Thera. ThagA.i.180; Ap.i.168.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nārada</h4>
<p>A brahmin in the time of Atthadassī Buddha, a former birth 
of Pavittha (or Ekadamsaniya) Thera. He was also called Kesava. ThagA.i.185; 
Ap.i.168f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nārada</h4>
<p>Minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was entrusted 
with escorting the ascetic Kesava, when lie fell ill, to Kappa’s hermitage in 
Himavā. Nārada is identified with Sāriputta. For details see the Kesava Jātaka. 
J.iii.143ff., 362; DhA.i.344.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Nārada</h4>
<p>A sage, younger brother of Kāladevala and pupil of 
Jotipāla (Sarabhanga). He lived in the Majjhimapadesa in Arañjaragiri. He became 
enamoured of a courtesan, and was saved only through the intervention of 
Sarabhanga. For details see the Indriya Jataka. J.iii.463ff.; v.133f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Nārada</h4>
<p>An ascetic, son of the ascetic Kassapa. He was tempted by 
a maiden fleeing from brigands, but his father came to his rescue. For details 
see the Culla Nārada Jātaka. J.iv.220ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>8. Nārada</h4>
<p>King of Mithilā, seventh in direct descent from Sādhina. 
He is identified with Ānanda. For details see the Sādhīna Jātaka. J.iv.355ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>9. Nārada</h4>
<p>A brahmin sage, called a devabrāhmana, and Nāradadeva. One 
day, having wandered about in Tāvatimsa, he was returning to his dwelling in 
Kañcanaguhā holding a Pāricchattaka flower over his head, when the four 
daughters of Sakka — </p>
<ul>
  <li>Āsā, </li>
  <li>Saddhā, </li>
  <li>Sirī and </li>
  <li>Hirī </li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp; asked him to give it to them. He agreed to give it 
to that one among them whom they should choose as their queen. They sought the 
advice of their father, who directed them to Macchariya Kosiya. Kosiya decided 
in favour of Hirī. </p>
<p>Nārada is identified with Sāriputta. For details see the 
Sudhābhojana Jataka (J.v.392ff). It is probably this same Nārada who is 
mentioned as being present when Kunāla (q.v.) delivered his famous diatribe 
against women. He is described as possessing the pañcābhiññā and as being 
attended by ten thousand ascetics. When Kunāla had finished his discourse, 
Nārada supplemented it with all he knew of the vices of women (Ibid.,424, 
450ff., 456). He is also mentioned as having admonished Mahājanaka when the 
latter renounced the world. In that context, Nārada is described as belonging to 
the Kassapa gotta. J.vi.56, 58, 68. In SNA.i.359 he is called Nārada Devala. 
This may be a wrong reading for Nāradadeva.</p>
<hr>
<h4>10. Nārada</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a Mahā Brahma. He helped Rujā to 
convince her father, Angati, of the truth as declared by her. He came down to 
earth and frightened Angati by revealing to him the horrors of hell. In this 
context he is described as belonging to the Kassapa gotta. For details see the 
Mahānāradakassapa Jataka. J.vi.220, 242 ff.; Ap.ii.483.</p>
<hr>
<h4>11. Nārada</h4>
<p>A celebrated physician, probably identical with the famous 
sage, No. 9, above. Mil.272.</p>
<hr>
<h4>12. Nārada</h4>
<p>The fifth future Buddha. Anāgat. p. 40.</p>
<hr>
<h4>13. Nārada</h4>
<p>A Thera, mentioned once as staying at the Ghositārāma in 
Kosambī, with Mūsila, Savittha, and Ānanda. In the course of discussion he 
declares that, though aware of the nature of nibbana, he is not an arahant 
(S.ii.115f). Elsewhere (A.iii.57f) he is mentioned as staying in the Kukkutārāma 
in Pātaliputta. At that time King Munda was grieving over the death of his wife,&nbsp; 
Bhaddā, to the neglect of everything else, and his treasurer, Piyaka, suggested 
that he should visit Nārada. The king agreed, and Nārada preached to him on the 
inevitable ness of old age, disease, death, etc. Munda was consoled, and buried 
the body of his wife, which he had till then preserved.</p>
<p>He may be identical with the Thera mentioned in the Peta 
Vatthu Commentary (PvA.2, 10, 11, 14, 204, 208, 210, 211) as finding out from 
various petas the stories of their deeds, and in the Vimāna Vatthu Commentary 
(VvA.165, 169, 203) as visiting various vimānas in the course of his wanderings 
among the deva worlds (devacārikā). He is stated as having repeated the stories 
he learnt to the dhammasangāhakas to be embodied in their rescensions.</p>

<h4><a name="15">15</a>. Nārada</h4>
<p>A Yakkha who presided over Nāradakūta. Offerings, which 
included a man from each village, were brought to him once a year. Dīpankara 
Buddha visited him and, after performing many miracles, converted him. He, with

<hr>
