<p>A householder of Campā, a devout and skilled follower of 
the Buddha. Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggarā Lake, he found he 
had arrived too early and went into the Paribbājakārāma near by. The 
Paribbājakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of 
asceticism and austerity. They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline 
which he himself did not follow, a nihilist (venayika) and a visionary (? 
appaññattika). (For explanation of these terms, see AA.ii.854). Vajjiyamāhita 
refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and 
what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus 
silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The 
Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and 
asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the 
promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged. When Vajjiyamāhita had 
left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good 
householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other 
persuasions. A.v.189ff.; see also A.iii.451.</p>
