  <h2>Cūlaccharāsanghāta Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If for just the duration of a 
finger-snap a monk indulges in a thought of goodwill and cultivates a thought of 
goodwill, he is verily to be called a monk. Earnestness, above all other things, 
encourages the arising of good states; indulgence, worst of all things, 
encourages evil states (A.i.10).</p>
<p>It is said (AA.i.40) that this sutta was 
preached at Jetavana to counteract the effects of the Aggikkhandhopama Sutta, 
which frightened many monks, causing them to revert to the lay life, the Order 
being thereby greatly impoverished in numbers. The present sutta was designed to 
reassure those who were in doubt.</p>
