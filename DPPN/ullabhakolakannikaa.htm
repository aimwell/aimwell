<p>Evidently a village in Ceylon. A woman 
of this village, having learnt that the Thera Dīghabhānaka-Abhaya was reciting 
the Ariyavamsa-patipāda, went all the way to hear him, a distance of five 
leagues, nursing her baby the while. She arrived at the vihāra and, having laid 
the baby down, listened to two preachers. Earlier in the day, when Abhaya Thera, 
having finished a portion of the sermon, was about to take some refreshment, she 
censured him, saying that he should have refreshed himself earlier. The thera 
agreed and finished the sermon and, at the last word, the woman became a 
sotāpanna. AA.i.386.</p>
