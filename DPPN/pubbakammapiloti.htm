  <h2>Pubbakammapiloti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A chapter in the Apadāna (Ap.i.299 ff ) which gives 
incidents from several lives of the Bodhisatta in explanation of the reason for 
which the Buddha suffered in various ways during his last life — 
e.g., from persecutions at the hands of his enemies and from various bodily 
ills. Most of the incidents mentioned are not to be found in the Jātakas.</p>
<p>This chapter is described as a Buddhāpadāna (Ibid., 301), 
but there is no reference either to it or to the incidents recounted in the 
chapter entitled Buddhāpadāna which is found at the beginning of the Apadāna.

<p>See also Pilotikamma.</p>
