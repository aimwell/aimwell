<p>Records the visit of the Buddha to 
Khomadussa. The brahmins were gathered on some business, and the Buddha walked 
into their meeting, thus angering them. It is said that he caused a shower of 
rain to fall (perhaps to give him an excuse for taking shelter). When the 
brahmins protested against his intrusion, the Buddha told them that it was no 
“council” where good men were not, and where the rules of debate were not 
observed; this sermon pleased them. S.i.184; SA.i.207.</p>
