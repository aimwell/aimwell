<p><b>1. Ariya.</b>-A country and people in South 
India. Palandīpa was one of its divisions. It once had a king named Vīradeva who 
led an expedition against Jayabāhu I. of Ceylon (Cv.lxi.36f).</p>
<p>It was also the name of a dynasty, the 
Aryan dynasty of the Pāndya (Pandu) in South India. Cv.lxiii.15; see also Cv. 
trans. i.239, n.1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ariya.</b>-A fisherman of a settlement 
near the north gate of Sāvatthi. The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya for sotāpatti, 
passed with the congregation of monks close by the spot where he was fishing and 
stopped not far from him. Then the Buddha proceeded to ask the monks their 
names, and noticing that the fisherman himself expected to be questioned, he 
asked him his. On learning that it was Ariya, the Buddha suggested to him that 
he was unworthy of the name, because a real Ariya never injured any living 
thing. At the end of the discourse the fisherman became a sotāpanna. 
DhA.iii.396-8.</p>

<p><b>2. Ariya Sutta.</b>-The four satipatthānas,
