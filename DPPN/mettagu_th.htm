</ul>
<p>One of the sixteen disciples of <a href="bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a> who visited the 
Buddha. His question (pucchā) to the Buddha was as to how various ills originated in the world, and the Buddha’s answer, that it was through <i>upadhi.</i> At the end of the sermon Mettagū and his thousand followers attained arahantship 
(SN.vss.1006, 1049 60; SNA.ii.592).  </p>
<p>According to the Apadāna (ii.342f), he gave 
away alms worth sixty crores of gold before joining Bāvarī.</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was an ascetic living 
near Mount Asoka in Himavā, in a hermitage built for him by Vissakamma. There 
the Buddha visited him, and the ascetic gave him a bowl filled with ghee and 
oil. As a result, he was eighteen times king of the gods and fifty-one times 
king of men.</p>
