<p>He was never guilty of any improper movement of hand or 
foot, but always carried himself with composure and dignity. This was because 
his mother was a lioness. For a lioness, when she has eaten prey, goes into her 
cave where she lies, for seven days, on a bed of red arsenic and yellow 
orpiment. When she rises on the seventh day, if she finds the bed disturbed by 
any movement on her part, she again lies down for seven days, saying: “This does 
not become your birth or lineage.” When the monks praised Santakāya to the 
Buddha, he held up the Elder as an example to be followed. Dhp.iv.113f.</p>
