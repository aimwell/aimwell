<p>Mother of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, king of 
Pañcāla, her husband being Mahā Cūlani. </p>
<p>She was a very wise woman, wiser than 
the ten sages of the court. A story is related of how, in her wisdom, she 
managed to procure an adequate reward for a man who had saved another from 
drowning at the risk of his own life (J.vi.398). We are told that, while her son 
was still young, she committed adultery with the chaplain Chambhī, poisoned her 
husband, and made the chaplain king. Later, Chambhī wished to kill Cūlani, but 
Talatā saved his life by sending him to the royal cook (J.vi.471f). </p>
<p>She had a son by Chambī, called 
Tikhinamantī (J.vi.474). </p>
<p>She is identified with Cullanandikā 
(J.vi.478). </p>
