<p>A mountain near Anur훮dhapura, the present Mihintale. It 
was while hunting the elk on this mountain that Dev훮nampiyatissa met Mahinda who 
had come with his companions to convert the Island to Buddhism. It was on 
Sil훮k큰ta, the northern peak of the mountain, that Mahinda alighted after his 
journey through the air from India, while the conversation between him and the 
king took place in Ambatthala, the small tableland below the peak (Mhv.xiii.14, 
20; xiv.2; Dpv.xii.28, 37ff). </p>
<p>The mountain later came to be called Cetiyagiri (q.v.). 
Mhv.xvii.23; Dpv.xiv.56.</p>
