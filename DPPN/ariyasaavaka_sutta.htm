<p>1. Ariyasāvaka Sutta.-Preached at 
Sāvatthi. The well-taught Ariyan disciple does not wonder as to the cause and 
effect of things, he knows that it really is the arising and the passing away of 
the world. His is the knowledge of the trained man; he is possessed of the 
insight of revulsion, he stands knocking at the door of the deathless. S.ii.77.</p>
<p>2. Ariyasāvaka Sutta.-Same as above, 
with a very slight variation in the final paragraph, in the wording, not in the 
sense. S.ii.79.</p>
