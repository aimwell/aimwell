<p>The Bodhisatta, born as king of Benares. 
He was so called (“Welcome”) because he was born to his parents as a result of 
their prayers. He had a step-sister, Udayabhaddā. When his parents wished him to 
marry, he refused, but in the end, yielding to their entreaties, he made a 
woman’s image in gold and desired them to find a wife who resembled it. 
Udayabhaddā alone could rival the image, so she was wedded to Udayabhadda. They 
lived together in chastity and, in due course, when Udayabhadda died, the 
princess became queen. The king was born as Sakka, and honouring a promise he 
had made to the princess to return and announce to her the place of his birth, 
he visited her as soon as he remembered her, and, before revealing himself, 
tested her in various ways. Being satisfied with her conduct, he instructed her 
and went away. The princess, renouncing the kingdom, became a recluse. Later she 
was born in Tāvatimsa as the Bodhisatta’s handmaiden. J.iv.104ff.</p>
