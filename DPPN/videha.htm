<p><b>1. Videha. </b>A setthi in the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha. He was a previous birth of <a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>. His wife was Bhaddā 
Kāpilānī in this age. Ap.ii.578.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Videha, Videhā.</b> A country and its people. At the 
time of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, Videha formed one of the two important principalities of the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajjian</a> confederacy. Its capital was 
<a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a>. The kingdom bordered on the 
Ganges, on one side of which was <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> and on the other Videha (See, e.g., 
M.i.225; MA.i.448). Adjacent to it were <a href="kaasi.htm" title="ka/kaasi.htm">Kāsi</a> and 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>. In the
<a href="gandhaara_jat_406.htm" title="g/gandhaara_jat_406.htm">Gandhāra Jātaka</a> 
(J.iii.365; iv. 316) the kingdom of Videha is said to have been three hundred 
leagues in extent, with sixteen thousand villages, well filled storehouses and 
sixteen thousand dancing girls. Videha was a great trade centre, and mention is 
made (PvA.227) of merchants coming from <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> to sell their wares in Videha. 
 
</p>
<p>The <a href="suruci_jat_489.htm" title="s/suruci_jat_489.htm">Suruci Jātaka</a> seems to show that a close connection existed between Videha and Benares. In the Buddha’s time, one of Bimbisāra’s queens was probably 
from Videha (see <a href="vedehiputta.htm" title="vy/vedehiputta.htm">Vedehiputta</a>). Mention is also made (MA.i.534) of a friendship 
existing between the kings of <a href="gandhaara.htm" title="g/gandhaara.htm">Gandhāra</a> and Videha. In earlier times Videha was 
evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being <a href="mahajanaka.htm" title="maha/mahajanaka.htm">Mahājanaka</a> and 
<a href="nimi.htm" title="n/nimi.htm">Nimi</a>; but 
in the Buddha’s time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation. 
According to the <a href="mahagovinda_s.htm" title="maha/mahagovinda_s.htm">Mahāgovinda Sutta</a> (D.ii.235), it was King
<a href="renu.htm" title="r/renu.htm">Renu</a> who, with the 
help of <a href="jotipaala.htm" title="j/jotipaala.htm">Mahāgovinda Jotipāla</a>, founded the Videha kingdom. The Commentaries 
(E.g., DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) state that Videha was colonized by the inhabitants, 
who were brought from <a href="pubbavideha.htm" title="pu/pubbavideha.htm">Pubbavideha</a> by King Mandhātā.</p>
<p>The Satapatha Brāhmana (I.iv.1), however, ascribes the 
kingdom to Māthava the Videgha, and gives as its boundaries Kausikī in the east, 
the Ganges to the south, the Sadārūra in the west, and the Himālaya in the 
north. In the centre of Videha was Pabbatarattha, in which was the city 
Dhammakonda, the residence of Dhaniya. (SNA.i.26).</p>
<p>The strainer used by the Buddha was honoured, after his 
death, by the people of Videha (Bu.xxviii.11).</p>
<p>Uruvela Kassapa was, in a previous birth, king of Videha 
(Ap.ii.483).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Videha. </b>The name of a king of Videha, the father 
of the Bodhisatta in the <a href="viniilak_jat_160.htm" title="vy/viniilak_jat_160.htm">Vinīlaka Jātaka</a> (q.v.). v.l. Vedeha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Videha. </b>A king of Videha who later became an 
ascetic. For his story see the <a href="gandhaara_jat_406.htm" title="g/gandhaara_jat_406.htm">Gandhāra Jātaka</a>. He is identified with Ānanda. v.l. Vedeha. J.iii.369.</p>
