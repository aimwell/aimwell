<p><b>1. Vessabhū. </b>The twenty first of the twenty four 
Buddhas. He was born in the pleasance of Anoma (Commentary, Anūpama), his father 
being the khattiya Suppatita (Supatita) and his mother Yasavatī. </p>
<p>On the day of his birth he roared “like a bull” a shout of 
triumph, hence his name (vasabhanādahetuttā). (But MT. 63 gives another 
explanation: hīnam janānam abhibhūto maggena abhibhavitakilesahīno ti vā. 
Dvy.333 calls him Visvabhū). </p>
<p>For six thousand years he lived in the household in three 
palaces: Ruci, Suruci and Vaddhana (Rativaddhana); his wife was Sucittā, and 
their son Suppabuddha. He left home in a golden palanquin, practiced austerities 
for six months, was given milk rice by Sirivaddhanā of Sucittanigama, and grass 
for his seat by the Nāga king Narinda, and attained Enlightenment under a sāla 
tree. He preached his first sermon at Anurārāma to his brothers, Sona and 
Uttara, who became his chief disciples. </p>
<p>Among women his chief disciples were Dāmā and Samālā, his 
constant attendant Upasanta (Upasannaka), his chief lay patrons Sotthika and 
Rāma among men, and Gotamī (Kāligotamī) and Sirimā among women. He was sixty 
cubits in height and lived for sixty thousand years. He died at the Khemārāma in 
Usabhavatī and his relics were scattered. The Bodhisatta was King Sudassana of 
Sarabhavatī. (Bu.xxii.1ff.; BuA.205ff.; D.ii.5.; J.i.41).</p>
<p>Vessabhū Buddha kept the uposatha once in every six years. 
DhA.iii.236.</p>

<p><b>2. Vessabhū. </b>King of Avanti in the time of Renu. 
His capital was Māhissatī. D.ii.236.</p>
