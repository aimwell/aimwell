<p><b>1. Selā. </b>A princess, younger sister of Candakumāra 
(J.vi.143). She is identified with Uppalavannā. J.vi.157.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Selā Therī.</b> She was born in Alavi as daughter of 
the king: therefore she was also called Alavikā. When she was still unmarried 
the Buddha visited Alavī with Alavaka, whom he had converted, carrying his 
begging bowl and robe. On that occasion Sela went with her father to hear the 
Buddha preach. She became a lay disciple, but later, agitated in mind, she 
joined the Order and became an arahant. After that she lived in Sāvatthi. One 
day, as she was enjoying her siesta in the Andhavana under a tree, Māra, in the 
guise of a stranger, approached her and tried to tempt her. But she refuted his 
statements regarding the attractions of lay life, and Māra had to retire 
discomfited (S.i.134; Thig.vss.57-9).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Selā was born in the 
family of a clansman of Hamsavatī and was given in marriage. After her husband’s 
death she devoted herself to the quest of good, and went from ārāma to ārāma and 
vihāra to vihāra, teaching the Dhamma to followers of the religion. One day she 
came to the Bodhi tree of the Buddha and sat down there thinking, “If a Buddha 
be peerless among men, may this tree show the miracle of Enlightenment.” 
Immediately the tree blazed forth, the branches appeared golden, and the sky was 
all shining. Inspired by the sight, she fell down and worshipped the tree, and 
sat there for seven days. On the seventh day she performed a great feast of 
offering and worship to the Buddha (ThigA.61f). Her Apadāna verses, quoted in 
the Therīgāthā Commentary, are, in the Apadāna itself, attributed to a Therī 
called Pañcadīpikā, and are twice repeated in these verses (Ap.ii.519, repeated 
at 527f), however, she is mentioned as having attained arahantship at the age of 
seven, and there is no reference to her life as daughter of the king of Alavī.

<p><b>3. Selā Therī.</b> An arahant. In the time of Kassapa 
Buddha she belonged to a lay disciple’s family in Sāvatthi. She heard the Buddha 
preach and learnt the Doctrine. She was born after death in Tāvatimsa. In her 
last life she was the daughter of a setthi, and hearing the Buddha preach, she 
entered the Order and attained arahantship. Ap.ii.614f.</p>
