<h2><a name="1">1</a>. Mahānāma Thera</h2>
<p>He was born in a brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and, after 
hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. Taking a formula of meditation, he 
dwelt on the hill called Nesādaka. Unable to prevent the rising of evil 
thoughts, he was disgusted with himself, and climbing a steep crag, made as if 
to throw himself down, and evoking insight became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedhā Buddha he was a brahmin teacher 
skilled in the Vedas, and the Buddha visited him in his hermitage on the banks 
of the Sindhū and was given honey by him (ThagA.vs.115; ThagA.i.227ff). Mahānāma 
is probably identical with Madhudāyaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.325f.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2</a>. Mahānāma Thera</h2>
<p>One of the <a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiyā</a> (J.i.82). He became a sotāpanna on the third day after the preaching of the 
<a href="dhammacakkappavattana.htm" title="d/dhammacakkappavattana.htm">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>. He became 
an arahant on the day of the preaching of the
<a href="anattalakhana_s.htm" title="ay/anattalakhana_s.htm">Anattalakkhana Sutta</a>, together 
with the other Pañcavaggiyā (AA.i.84; MA.i.390). </p>
<p>Mahānāma once visited Macchikāsanda, and there 
Cittagahapati, seeing him beg for alms and pleased with his bearing, invited him 
to his house, gave him a meal, and listened to a sermon by him. Citta was 
greatly pleased, and offered his pleasure garden of Ambātakavana to Mahānāma as 
a gift to the Order and built there a great monastery. DhA.ii.74.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3</a>. Mahānāma</h2>
<p>A <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> rājā, son of 
<a href="amitodana.htm" title="am/amitodana.htm">Amitodana</a>; he was elder brother of 
<a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> and cousin of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. When the Sākiyan families of 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> 
sent their representatives to join the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma allowed Anuruddha to leave the household, he knowing nothing of 
household affairs. Vin.ii.180f.; DhA.i.133; iv.124, etc.; but according to 
Northern sources (Rockhill, p. 13) he was son of Dronodana; according to ThagA. 
(ii.123) Ānanda was a brother (or, at least, a step brother) of Mahānāma, for 
there Ānanda’s father is given as Amitodana. But see MA.i.289, where Mahānāma’s 
father is called Sukkodana and Ānanda’s Amitodana. </p>
<p>Mahānāma showed great generosity to the Sangha, and was 
proclaimed best of those who gave choice alms to the monks (A.i.26). Once, with 
the Buddha’s permission, he supplied the Order with medicaments for three 
periods of four months each. The <a href="chabbaggiyaa.htm" title="c/chabbaggiyaa.htm">Chabbaggiyā</a>, always intent on mischief, tried 
in vain to discourage him. Vin.iv.101; AA. (i.213) adds that this was during the 
period of want experienced by the Buddha and his monks at 
<a href="veranjaa.htm" title="vy/veranjaa.htm">Verañjā</a>. At the end of 
the year, Mahānāma wished to continue the supply of good food to the Buddha and 
his monks, but the Buddha refused his permission. </p>
<p>Mahānāma was a devoted follower of the Buddha and wished 
to understand the Doctrine. The books record several conversations between him 
and the Buddha, and Ānanda, Godha, and Lomasavangīsa (see 
<a href="mahanama_s.htm" title="maha/mahanama_s.htm">Mahānāma Sutta</a> and
<a href="lomasa_vangisa.htm" title="l/lomasa_vangisa.htm">Lomasavangisa</a>). Once when the Buddha arrived at Kapilavatthu he asked Mahānāma 
to find him lodging for the night. Mahānāma tried everywhere without success, 
and finally suggested that the Buddha should spend the night in the hermitage of 
<a href="bharandukalama.htm" title="b/bharandukalama.htm">Bharandu Kālāma</a> (S.v.327f). This he did, and was joined there the next morning 
by Mahānāma; as a result of the discussion between the Buddha, Mahānāma and 
Bharandu, the last-named left Kapilavatthu never to return. On 
another occasion, Mahānāma visited the Buddha at <a href="nigrodharama.htm" title="n/nigrodharama.htm">Nigrodhārāma</a> where the Buddha 
was convalescing after a severe illness, and at once Mahānāma asked a question 
as to whether concentration followed or preceded knowledge. Ānanda, who was 
present, not wishing the Buddha to be troubled, took Mahānāma aside and 
explained to him the Buddha’s teachings on the subject. See 
<a href="sakkaa_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkaa_sutta.htm">Sakka Sutta</a> 
(S.i.219f.).</p>
<p>Mahānāma had a daughter <a href="vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm" title="va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm">Vāsābhakhattiyā</a>, born to him by a 
slave-girl named Nāgamundā, and when <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> asked the 
Sākiyans to give him in 
marriage a Sākiyan maiden they met in the Mote Hall, and, following the advice of 
Mahānāma, sent Vāsabhakhattiyā to him. In order to allay any suspicions, 
Mahānāma sat down to a meal with her, taking one mouthful from the same dish; 
but before he could swallow it a messenger arrived, as secretly arranged, and 
summoned him away. He left, asking Vāsabhakhattiyā to continue her meal 
(DhA.i.345f.; J.i.133; iv. 145f).</p>
<p>See also the <a href="cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s.htm" title="c/cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s.htm">Cūla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta</a> and
<a href="sekha_sutta.htm" title="s/sekha_sutta.htm">Sekha Sutta</a>, 
both preached to Mahānāma.</p>
<p>His resolve to attain to eminence as the best distributor 
of pleasant food to the monks was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was 
then a householder of Hamsavatī and heard the Buddha confer a similar rank on a 
monk (AA.i.213).</p>
<p>Mahānāma is included in a list of exemplary lay devotees 
(A.iii.451). The <a href="samantapaasaadikaa.htm" title="sa/samantapaasaadikaa.htm">Samantapāsādikā</a> (Sp.iv.857) adds that Mahānāma was one month 
older than the Buddha and that he was a sakadāgāmī.</p>

<h2><b><a name="4">4</a>. Mahānāma</b></h2>
<p>A Licchavi. One day while walking about in the Mahāvana in 
Vesāli he saw some young Licchavis paying homage to the Buddha and accused them 
of inconsistency. For details see the <a href="kumaara_s.htm" title="ku/kumaara_s.htm">Kumāra Sutta</a> (A.iii.75ff.).</p>

<h2><a name="5">5</a>. Mahānāma</h2>
<p>King of Ceylon. He was the younger brother of Upatissa II. 
and was for some time a monk, but he carried on an intrigue with Upatissa’s 
wife, and she killed her husband. Then Mahānāma became a layman, assumed the 
sovereignty, and married Upatissa’s queen. He built refuges for the sick, 
enlarged the Mahāpāli Hall, and erected the Lohadvāra , Ralaggāma, and 
Kotipassāvana vihāras, which he gave to the monks of Abhayagiri. A vihāra which 
he built on the Dhūmarakkha mountain, he gave, at the instigation of his queen, 
to the monks of Mahāvihāra. He ruled for twenty two years (409 31 A.C.). It was 
during his reign that Buddhaghosa arrived in Ceylon and wrote his Commentaries, 
dwelling in a vihāra given by the king. Cv.xxxvii.209ff.; see also P.L.C. 96. 
The king seems to have also been called Sirinivāsa and Sirikudda.</p>
<hr>
<h2><b><a name="6">6</a>. Mahānāma Thera</b></h2>
<p>Incumbent of Dīghasanda (or Dīghāsana) Vihāra 
(Cv.xxxix.42). He is generally identified with the uncle of Dhātusena mentioned 
elsewhere (Cv.xxxviii.16). Moggallāna I. built for him the Pabbata vihāra 
(Cv.xxxix.42). Mahānāma is generally regarded as the author of the older part of 
the Mahāvamsa. MT. 687; e.g., in Gv.61, 66; Svd.1266; for a discussion on this 
see P.L.C.139ff.</p>
<hr>
<h2><b><a name="7">7</a>. Mahānāma Thera</b></h2>
<p>Author of the Saddhammappakāsanī Commentary on the 
Patisambhidāmagga (Gv.61; Svd.1196). The colophon to the book (PSA.526) states 
that he lived in the Uttaramanti parivena in the Mahāvihāra and finished his 
work in the third year after the death of Moggallāna (probably Moggallāna I.). 
The Gandhavamsa (Gv.70) says that the work was written at the request of an 
upāsaka, also named Mahānāma.</p>
