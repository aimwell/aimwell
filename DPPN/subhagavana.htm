<p>A wood in Ukkatthā. Once, when the Buddha was there, he 
visited the Avihā gods (D.ii.50) and, again, from there he visited Baka Brahmā, 
to whom he preached the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326; but see S.i.142, where 
the Buddha is said to have been at Jetavana). It was under a sāla tree in 
Subhagavana that the Mūlapariyāya Sutta was preached (M.i.1; also the Jātakas, 
of the same name, J.ii.259).</p>
<p>The wood was so called because of its beauty. People often 
went there for pleasure, and, influenced by the romantic nature of the 
surroundings, would plan pleasant things, which would come to pass (MA.i.10).</p>
