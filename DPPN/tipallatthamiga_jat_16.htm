<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as a stag, 
leader of a herd of deer. Rāhula was his sister’s son and was entrusted to him, 
that he might learn the “deer’s tricks.” The young stag followed his instruction 
diligently and one day, being caught in a net, he feigned death and so made his 
escape.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Rāhula. Once, at the Aggālavacetiya, the Buddha, noticing that monks were in the 
habit of sleeping with novices in the preaching-hall after the sermon, he passed 
a rule making this a pācittiya-offence. As a result, Rāhula could find no 
lodging and spent the night in the Buddha’s jakes, not wishing to transgress the 
rule. The Buddha, discovering this, assembled the monks and blamed them for 
their thoughtlessness, for if they thus treated his son, what might they not do 
to the other novices. The rule about lodgings was thereupon modified. The story 
was related to show Rāhula’s diligence in following rules (J.i.160ff; cp. 
Vin.iv.16).</p>
<p>The Jātaka seems also to have been 
called the Sikkhākāma Jātaka. JA.1876, p.516.</p>
