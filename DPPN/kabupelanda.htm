<p>A village and monastery in Ceylon. In 
the monastery once lived a sāmanera, possessed of great iddhi powers, who, not 
heeding the advice of his teacher, fell in love with a weaver’s daughter and, as 
a result, lost all his powers. Later, the woman lost her sight through a blow 
from him, and he was reduced to abject poverty. The sāmanera’s teacher had 
warned him of just this, but the warning was of no avail (VibhA.294f.; but see 
MA.ii.699f., where the names are spelt differently). v.l. Kammupelanda, 
Kampupelanda, Kapupelanda. See also Kupuvena.</p>
