<p><b>1. Susīma Jātaka (No. 163).</b> Susīma was king of 
Benares, and the Bodhisatta was his chaplain’s son. The chaplain had been master 
of ceremonies in the king’s elephant festival, and, as a result, had amassed 
great wealth. He died when his son was sixteen. Soon after, another elephant 
festival came round, and other brahmins obtained the king’s consent to be in 
charge of the ceremonies on the plea that the chaplain’s son was too young. When 
but four days remained before the festival, the Bodhisatta found his mother 
weeping. She explained that for seven successive generations their family had 
managed the elephant festival and that she felt the change deeply. The 
Bodhisatta discovered that a teacher expert in elephant lore lived in 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, 
two thousand yojanas away. He comforted his mother and proceeded to Takkasilā, 
reaching it in a single day. There he paid his fee of one thousand pieces to the 
teacher and explained the urgency of his mission. In one night the teacher 
taught him the three Vedas and the elephant lore, and the pupil could even excel 
his teacher in knowledge. The next morning he left early for Benares and reached 
it in one day.</p>
<p>On the day of the festival the Bodhisatta went in all his 
array before the king, and protested against the alienation of his rights. He 
challenged anyone to show his superiority over him in elephant lore, and nobody 
could be found to do so. The king then appointed him to conduct the ceremonies.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to an attempt on the 
part of the heretics to prevent the people of Sāvatthi from giving alms to the 
Buddha. All the people of the city made a collection to hold an almsgiving, but 
they were divided in their allegiance, some wishing to entertain the Buddha, 
others favouring heretical teachers. A vote was passed, and the majority were 
found to be in favour of the Buddha. For a whole week alms were given on a 
lavish scale, and, at the end of the week, the Buddha pronounced a benediction.</p>
<p><a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> is identified with Susīma, 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> with the 
teacher, Mahāmāyā with the Bodhisatta’s mother, and Suddhodana with his father. 
J.ii.45-50.</p>

<p><b>2. Susīma Jātaka (No. 411).</b> The Bodhisatta was born 
as son of the chaplain of the king of Benares and was called 
<a href="susiima.htm" title="s/susiima.htm">Susīma</a>. The king’s 
son, born on the same day, was called <a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>. Together they grew up, and 
then studied under the same teacher in <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>. Later Brahmadatta became king 
and Susīma his chaplain. One day, when Susīma was taking part in a procession 
with the king, the queen mother saw him and fell desperately in love with him. 
The king, discovering this, made Susīma king in his place and the queen mother 
Susīma’s queen. But Susīma soon tired of royalty, and after establishing 
Brahmadatta once more on the throne, returned to the Himālaya in spite of his 
wife’s protests. There he became an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the Buddha’s 
Renunciation. <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> is identified with Brahmadatta and the queen mother with 
<a href="rahulamata.htm" title="r/rahulamata.htm">Rāhulamātā</a>. J.iii.391-7.</p>
