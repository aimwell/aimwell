<p>The Bodhisatta once became an Ajīvaka and practised all 
manner of austerities in order to test the efficiency of asceticism, enduring 
extremes of heat and cold. He realized his error as he lay dying, and was reborn 
in the deva world.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Sunakkhatta, who, 
having left the Order and joined Korakkhattiya, went about Vesāli, vilifying the 
Buddha and declaring that his doctrines did not lead to the destruction of 
suffering. When Sāriputta reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha declared that 
he had tested the efficacy of asceticism ninety kappas ago and had found it 
wanting. J.i.389-91.</p>
<p>The story is also referred to in the Cariyāpitaka iii.15 
as the Mahālomahamsacariyā, where it exemplifies the practice of upekkhā. 
J.i.47.</p>
