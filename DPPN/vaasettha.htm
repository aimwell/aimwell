<p><b>1. Vāsettha.</b> The constant attendant of Nārada 
Buddha. J.i.37; Bu.x.23.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vāsettha, Vāsittha.</b> The name of an old rsi held 
in high esteem for his knowledge. He was one of the originators of the Vedic 
runes.</p>
<p>Vin.i.245; D.i.104; M.ii.164, 200; Mil.162, etc.; cf. 
Vasistha in Vedic Index.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vāsettha.</b> Name of a gotta, probably tracing its 
descent to the sage Vāsettha (Skt. Vasistha). In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta 
(D.ii.147, 159) we find the Mallas of Kusināra addressed as Vāsetthā, as well as 
the Mallas of Pāvā (D.iii.209). It was a gotta held in esteem (ukkattha). E.g., 
Vin.iv.8.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vāsettha.</b> A young brahmin who, with his friend 
Bhāradvāja, visited the Buddha and held discussions with him. These discussions 
are recorded in the Tevijja Sutta, the Vāsettha Sutta, and the Aggañña Sutta. 
Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.399; SNA.ii.463; cf. SN., p.116) that Vāsettha was the 
chief disciple of Pokkharasāti. According to him again (DA.ii.406; cf.iii.860, 
872), Vāsettha’s first visit to the Buddha was on the occasion of the preaching 
of the Vāsettha Sutta, at the conclusion of which he accepted the Buddha as his 
teacher. He again did so, when, at his next visit, the Buddha preached to him 
the Tevijja Sutta. Soon after, he entered the Order, and, at the conclusion of 
the preaching of the Aggañña Sutta, he was given the higher ordination and 
attained arahantship. He belonged to a very rich family and renounced forty 
crores when he left the world. He was an expert in the three Vedas.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vāsettha. </b>A lay disciple, evidently distinct 
from Vāsettha (3). He visited the Buddha at the Kūtagārasālā in Vesāli and the 
Buddha preached to him (A.iv.258). See Vāsettha Sutta (2). He is mentioned among 
the Buddha’s eminent lay disciples. A.iii.451.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vāsettha. </b>A brahmin; see Dhūmakāri. The 
scholiast explains (J.iii.402) that he belonged to the Vāsetthagotta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Vāsettha. </b>A brahmin of Kapilavatthu, father of 
Vappa Thera. ThagA.i.140.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Vāsettha.</b> A very rich brahmin, father of Sela 
Thera. Ap.i.318.</p>
