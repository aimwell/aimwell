<p>King of Ceylon (1137-1153). He was the 
son of Vikkamabāhu II. and succeeded his father to the throne (Cv.lx.88, 
according to the Dimbulāgala Inscription, his mother was Sundarī). Thus he was 
the grandson of Vijayabāhu I and of Tilokasundarī, and came, therefore, of 
Kālinga stock. When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamabāhu 
(afterwards Parakkamabāhu I.), Gajabāhu sent for him with many marks of favour 
and welcomed him at his court. In order to win the king’s confidence Parakkama 
gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajabāhu was 
becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to 
wage war against him. In the campaign that followed, Gajabāhu suffered many 
reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama’s forces. With great 
difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime Mānābharana 
managed to get Gajabāhu into his power and cast him into a dungeon. From there 
he was rescued by Parakkamabāhu and fled to Kotthasāra. Meanwhile, Parakkamabāhu 
had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura. Gajabāhu, 
being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede 
on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamabāhu left to Gajabāhu the 
enjoyment of his possessions. (This is rather odd, especially in view of the 
fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53). Gajabāhu 
took up his abode at Gangātalāka and spent his last days there in comparative 
peace. As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to 
Parakkamabāhu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vihāra. He 
was cremated at Kotthasāra. (Details of Gajabāhu’s reign and his fights with 
Parakkamabāhu are contained in the Cūlavamsa, particularly in chapters 63, 66, 
67, 70, 71). See also Gajabāhukagāmani.</p>
