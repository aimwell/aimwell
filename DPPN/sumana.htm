<hr>
<p><b>1. Sumana. </b>The fourth of the twenty four Buddhas. 
He was born in Mekhala, his father being the khattiya Sudatta and his mother 
Sirimā. For nine thousand years he lived as a householder in three palaces — 
Canda, Sucanda and Vatamsa (BuA.125 calls them Nārivaddhana, Somavaddhana and 
Iddhivaddhana) — his wife being Vatamsikā and his son Anupama. He left the world 
on an elephant, practised austerities for ten months, and attained enlightenment 
under a nāga tree, being given a meal of milk rice by Anupamā, daughter of 
Anupama-setthi of Anoma, and grass for his seat by the Ajīvaka Anupama. His 
first sermon was preached in the Mekhala Park, and among his first disciples 
were his step brother Sarana and the purohita’s son Bhāvitatta. His Twin miracle 
was performed in Sunandavatī. The Bodhisatta was a Nāga king Atula. One of the 
Buddha’s chief assemblies was on the occasion of his solving the questions of 
King Arindama on Nirodha.</p>
<p>Sarana and Bhāvitatta were his chief monks and Sonā and 
Upasenā his chief nuns. Udena was his personal attendant. Varuna and Sarana were 
his chief lay supporters among men and Cālā and Upacālā among women. His body 
was ninety cubits in height, and he died at the age of ninety thousand in 
Angārāma, where a thūpa of four yojanas was erected over his ashes. Bu.v.1ff.; 
BuA.125f.; J.i.30,34,35, 40.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sumana. </b>Attendant of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; 
Bu.xi.24). His eminence prompted Ānanda (Sumana in that birth) to resolve to be 
an attendant of some future Buddha. ThagA.ii.122; see also Ap.i.195.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sumana. </b>Step brother of Padumuttara, Buddha. He 
obtained, as boon from the king, the privilege of waiting on the Buddha for 
three months. He built in the park of Sobhana a vihāra. The park belonged to the 
householder Sobhana, and he built the vihāra, on land for which he gave one 
hundred thousand. There he entertained the Buddha and his monks. Sunanda is 
identified with Ānanda. ThagA.ii.122f.; AA.i.160f.; SA.ii.168f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sumana.</b> A pupil of Anuruddha. He represented the 
monks from Pāveyyaka at the Second Council. Vāsabhagāmi was his colleague. See 
also Sumana (8). Mhv.iv.49, 58; Dpv.iv.48; v.24; Vin.ii.305, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="5">5</a>. Sumana. </b>A garland maker, given as an example of 
one whose acts bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115, 291, 350; cf. DhSA.426; 
PSA.498). He was Bimbisāra’s gardener, and provided the king daily with eight 
measures of jasmine flowers, for which he received eight pieces of money, One 
day, while on his way to the palace, he saw the Buddha, and threw two handfuls 
of flowers into the air, where they formed a canopy over the Buddha’s head. Two 
handfuls thrown on the right, two on the left and two behind, all remained 
likewise in the air and accompanied the Buddha as he walked through the city, a 
distance of three leagues, that all might see the miracle.</p>
<p>When Sumana returned home with his empty basket and told 
his wife what he had done, she was fearful lest the king should punish him. 
Going to the palace, she confessed what he had done, and asked for forgiveness 
for herself as she had had no part in the deed. Bimbisāra visited the Buddha and 
then sent for Sumana. Sumana confessed that when he offered the flowers to the 
Buddha he was quite prepared to lose his life. The king gave him the eightfold 
gift: eight female slaves, eight sets of jewels, eight thousand pieces of money, 
eight women from the royal harem, and eight villages.</p>
<p>In reply to a question by Ānanda, the Buddha said that in 
the future the garland maker would become a Pacceka Buddha, Sumana. DhA.ii.40f.; 
KhA.129. According to KhA., the Pacceka Buddha’s name will be Sumanissara.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sumana. </b>Chief lay supporter of Kassapa Buddha. 
DA.ii.424; but see Sumangala (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sumana Thera.</b> He belonged to a brahmin family of 
Kosala. His mother’s brother was an arahant, and ordained him as soon as he grew 
up. Sumana soon acquired the four jhānas and fivefold aññā and, in due course, 
attained arahantship.</p>
<p>Ninety five kappas ago he gave a harītaka-fruit to a 
Pacceka Buddha who was ill (Thag.vss.330-4; ThagA.i.411f). He is evidently 
identical with Harītakadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.394; cf. Avadānas ii. 67-70.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Sumana Thera. </b>See Cūla Sumana (3). He is 
probably identical with Sumana (4), and may be identical with Sumana (7) if the 
uncle mentioned in connection with the latter is Anuruddha.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago he was a garland maker and offered 
jasmine-flowers to Sikhī Buddha. Twenty six kappas ago he was king four times, 
under the name of Mahāyasa. Thagg.vss.429-34; ThagA.i.457f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Sumana Thera.</b> He is mentioned as having lived in 
Andhavana with Khema. Together they visited the Buddha, and, when Khema had gone 
away, Sumana talked with the Buddha about arahants (A.iii.348f). He is probably 
identical with Sumana (7) or (8).</p>

(Mhv.v.170). He joined the Order at the age of seven; even as a sāmanera he was 
gifted with the sixfold abhiññā and accompanied Mahinda to Ceylon 
(Mhv.xiii.4,18). Once when he announced that Mahinda was going to preach his 
voice was heard all over Ceylon (Mhv.xiv.33). In order to get relics for the 
cetiyas in Ceylon, he went (by air) to Papphapura (Pātaliputta), and from there 
to Sakka’s abode, for the Buddha’s right collar bone. He supervised the placing 
of the relics in the Thūpārāma-cetiya. Mhv.xvii.7, 21; xix.24, 42; see also

(q.v.) was his servant, but, later, Punna, as the result of giving alms to 
Sāriputta, became rich and Sumana married his daughter, Uttarā. Sumana was an 
unbeliever, and Uttarā, wishing for leisure in which to practise her religion, 
obtained for him the services of the courtezan Sirimā, paying her with the money 
obtained from her father. DhA.iii.104, 302f.</p>
