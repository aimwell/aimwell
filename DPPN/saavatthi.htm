<p>The capital town of Kosala in India and one of the six 
great Indian cities during the lifetime of the Buddha (D.ii.147). It was six 
leagues from Sāketa (Vin.i.253; seven according to others, DhA.i.387), forty 
five leagues north west of Rājagaha (SA.i.243), thirty leagues from Sankassa 
(J.iv.265), one hundred and forty seven from Takkasilā (MA.ii.987), one hundred 
and twenty from Suppāraka (DhA.ii.213), and was on the banks of the Aciravatī 
(Vin.i.191, 293). It was thirty leagues from Alavī (SNA.i.220), thirty from 
Macchīkāsanda (DhA.ii.79), one hundred and twenty from Kukkutavatī (DhA.ii.118), 
and the same distance from Uggapura (DhA.iii.469) and from Kuraraghara 
(DhA.iv.106). The road from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi passed through Vesāli 
(Vin.ii.159f), and the Parāyanavagga (SN.vss.1011 13) gives the resting places 
between the two cities&nbsp;&nbsp; Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā and 
Bhoganagara. Further on, there was a road running southwards from Sāvatthi 
through Sāketa to Kosambī. One gāvuta from the city was the Andhavana (q.v.). 
Between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was Toranavatthu (S.iv.374).</p>
<p>The city was called Sāvatthi because the sage Savattha 
lived there. Another tradition says there was a caravanserai there, and people 
meeting there asked each other what they had&nbsp;&nbsp; “Kim bhandam atthi?” “Sabbam 
atthi“&nbsp;&nbsp; and the name of the city was based on the reply (SNA.i.300; 
PSA. 367).</p>
<p>The Buddha passed the greater part of his monastic life in 
Sāvatthi. His first visit there was at the invitation of Anāthapindika. It is 
said (DhA.i.4) that he spent twenty five rainy seasons in the city&nbsp;&nbsp; 
nineteen of them in Jetavana and six in the Pubbārāma. Sāvatthi also contained 
the monastery of Rājakārāma (q.v.), built by Pasenadi, opposite Jetavana. 
Outside the city gate of Sāvatthi was a fisherman’s village of five hundred 
families (DhA.iv.40).</p>
<p>Savatthi is the scene of each Buddha’s Yamaka pātihāriya 
(DhA.iii.205; cf. Mtu.iii.115; J.i.88); Gotama Buddha performed this miracle 
under the Gandamba (q.v.).</p>
<p>The chief patrons of the Buddha in Sāvatthi were 
Anāthapindika, Visākhā, Suppavāsā and Pasenadi (DhA.i.330). When Bandhula (q.v.) 
left Vesāli he came to live in Sāvatthi.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iii.614) that, in the Buddha’s day, 
there were fifty seven thousand families in Sāvatthi, and that it was the chief 
city in the country of Kāsi Kosala, which was three hundred leagues in extent 
and had eighty thousand villages. The population of Sāvatthi was eighteen crores 
(SNA.i.371).</p>
<p>Sāvatthi is identified with Sāhet Māhet on the banks of 
the Rapti (Cunningham, AGI. 469).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang found the old city in ruins, but records the 
sites of various buildings (Beal, op. cit., ii.1 13).</p>
<p>Woodward states (KS.v.xviii ) that, of the four Nikāyas, 
871 suttas are said to have been preached in Sāvatthi; 844 of which are in 
Jetavana, 23 in the Pubbārāma, and 4 in the suburbs. These suttas are made up of 
6 in the Digha, 75 in the Majjhima, 736 in the Samyutta, and 54 in the 
Anguttara. Mrs. Rhys Davids conjectures (M.iv., Introd., p.vi) from this that 
either the Buddha “mainly resided there or else Sāvatthi was the earliest 
emporium (library?) for the collection and preservation (however this was done) 
of the talks.” The first alternative is the more likely, as the Commentaries 
state that the Buddha spent twenty five rainy seasons in Sāvatthi (see earlier), 
this leaving only twenty to be spent elsewhere. The Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA. 
p.3) gives a list of these places showing that the second, third, fourth, 
seventeenth and twentieth were spent in Rājagaha, the thirteenth, eighteenth and 
nineteenth in Cāliyapabbata, and the rest in different places.</p>
