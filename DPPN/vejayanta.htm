<p><b>1. Vejayanta.</b> A pāsāda belonging to Sakka. When 
Moggallāna visited Sakka to discover if he had fully understood the Buddha’s 
teaching in the Cūlatanhā sankhaya Sutta, Sakka tried to evade his questions by 
showing him this palace. It has one hundred towers, each seven stories high, 
with seven nymphs in each storey, waited on by seven attendants. The palace 
appeared in Tāvatimsa on the day of Sakka’s decisive victory over the Asuras. 
Moggallāna allowed himself to be shown round, and then, with his big toe, he 
made the palace quake and rock. M.i.252f.; cf. Thag. 1196f.; ThagA.ii.184. The 
palace was also made to rock by the novice Sangharakkhita (q.v.) on the day he 
joined the Order (DA.ii.558). </p>
<p>The palace is one thousand leagues high, and is so called 
because it arose in the hour of victory (J.i.203). It is decked with banners, 
each three hundred leagues long&nbsp;&nbsp; banners of gold on jewelled staffs 
and vice versa; and the whole palace is built of the seven precious substances. 
It arose as the result of the rest house built by Sakka, in his birth as Magha, 
for the use of the multitude (DhA.i.273; cf. DA.iii.698). When the Buddha 
visited Tāvatimsa with Nanda, Sakka was in the palace with his crimson footed (kakutapādiniyo) 
nymphs and came forward with them to greet him. The nymphs had given oil for the 
massaging of Kassapa Buddha’s feet, hence the colour of their own feet. 
SNA.i.274.</p>
<p>When King Sādhīna of Mithilā went to Tāvatimsa, he lived, 
according to human computation, seven hundred years in Vejayanta (J.iv.357).</p>
<p>The Vejayantapāsāda is illustrated on the Bharhut Tope.

<p><b>2. Vejayanta.</b> A chariot owned by Sakka, one hundred 
and fifty leagues in length (DA.ii.481; SA.i.261; J.i.202), and drawn by one 
thousand horses, with Mātali as charioteer (S.i.224). Sakka rode into battle in 
this chariot (J.i.202), and it was sent to fetch distinguished humans to 
Tāvatimsa&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., Nimi, Guttila and Sādhīna (q.v.). The Sudhābhojana 
Jātaka (J.v.408f ) contains a description of the chariot with its pole of gold 
and its framework overlaid with gilt representations of various animals and 
birds. When the chariot travelled the whole world was filled with the sound of 
its wheels.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vejayanta.</b> The chief of the eighty four thousand 
chariots owned by Mahāsudassana (S.iii.145; D.ii.187). The navel of its wheels 
was made of sapphire, the spokes of seven kinds of precious things, the rim of 
coral, the axle of silver, etc.&nbsp; SA.ii.237.</p>
