<p><b>1. Ghata</b> (also called <b>Ghatakumāra</b>). The 
Bodhisatta, born as the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. One of his ministers misconducted 
himself in the royal harem and the king, catching him in the act, banished him. 
The minister took service with Vanka, king of Sāvatthi, and persuaded him to 
attack Benares. Ghata was captured and thrown into prison, where he entered into 
ecstatic meditation. But Vanka was seized by a burning sensation, and he ordered 
the release of Ghata and the restoration of his kingdom. J.iii.168f; cf. Ekarāja.</p>

<p><b>2. Ghata </b>(also called <b>Ghatapandita</b>).-The 
Bodhisatta, born as the ninth of the ten <a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">Andhakavenhudāsaputtā</a>. When a son of 
his brother, <a href="vaasudeva.htm" title="va/vaasudeva.htm">Vāsudeva</a>, died, Vāsudeva lamented beyond all measure, and Ghata, 
wishing to cure him, feigned madness and went about Dvāravatī asking for the 
hare in the moon. When Vāsudeva heard of this from his courtier Rohineyya, he 
hastened to Ghata and argued with him about the ridiculousness of his quest. The 
plan succeeded and Vāsudeva was cured of his grief. J.iv.81, 84ff; Pv.ii.6; 
PvA.93f.</p>
