<p>The story of a monkey who used to visit 
the hermitage of some ascetics whose leader was the Bodhisatta; when they were 
away in the village, he upset everything he could lay hands on, and did much 
damage generally. When the ascetics were about to return from the village to the 
hermitage after the rainy season, the people brought them various foods, and the 
monkey, thinking to get some for himself, stood outside their hut worshipping 
the sun. The people, impressed by the monkey’s holy demeanour, started praising 
his virtues, whereupon the Bodhisatta revealed to them his true character 
(J.ii.72-3).</p>
<p>The story was related concerning a 
rogue.</p>
