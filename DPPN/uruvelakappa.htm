<p>A township of the Mallas in the Malla 
country. Once when the Buddha was staying there, Bhadragaka, the headman of the 
town, visited him, and the Buddha preached to him a sermon on the arising and 
the cessation of Ill (S.iv.327f). It was perhaps on the same occasion that the 
Buddha was visited by the headman Rāsiya, and he seems to have talked to him on 
various topics connected with the doctrine (S.iv.330ff). Record is also made of 
a sermon preached by the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and addressed to the monks 
regarding the importance of insight (ariyañāna) (S.iv.228f).</p>
<p>Once when the Buddha was staying at 
Uruvelakappa, he informed Ānanda that he wished to spend the day alone in the 
Mahāvana, and he went there and sat down at the foot of a tree. Meanwhile the 
householder Tapassu arrived and told Ānanda that be could not understand how 
young men in the prime of life found any attraction in renouncing the world. 
Ānanda took Tapassu to the Buddha, who set his doubts at rest. (A.iv.438ff)</p>
