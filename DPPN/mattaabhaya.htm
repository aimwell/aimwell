<p>Younger brother of Devānampiyatissa. 
   
  </p>
<p>He witnessed the miracles which attended the arrival of the Buddha’s Relics in 
  Ceylon, and, with one thousand others, entered the Order (Mhv.xvii.57f).  
</p>
<p>When 
  Mahā Arittha recited the Vinaya at the Thupārāma and held the Sangīti at the 
  suggestion of Mahinda, Mattābhaya, with five hundred others, was charged with 
  the duty of learning the Vinaya from him. Sp.i.103.</p>
