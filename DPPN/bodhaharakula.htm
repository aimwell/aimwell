<p>That name given to the descendants of the eight families 
who brought the branch of the Bodhi tree from Pātaliputta to Ceylon 
(Mhv.xix.67). </p>
<p>The heads of the families were brothers of Vedisadevī, 
wife of Asoka, and they were led by Sumitta and Bodhigutta (Mbv. p. 154). 
</p>
<p>The others (Mbv. p. 165) were Candagutta, Devagutta, 
Dhammagutta, Suriyagutta, Gotama and Jutindhara. They were entrusted with the 
ceremonies in connection with the Bodhi tree at Anurādhapura and each was given 
a special office.</p>
