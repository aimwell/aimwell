<p>He was of Ceylon, and crossed over to India, where he 
studied under Yonaka Dhammarakkhita. On his way home by sea he felt doubtful of 
one word, and returned all the way, one hundred 
leagues, to consult his teacher. On the way from the port he mentioned the word 
to a householder, who was so pleased with him that he gave him a blanket and one 
hundred thousand. This blanket Tissa gave to his teacher, but the latter cut it 
up and used it as a spread, as an example to others (not to desire luxuries). 
Tissa had his doubts set at rest and returned to Jambukola. There, at the 
Vālīkāvāma, as he was sweeping the courtyard of the cetiya, other monks asked 
him questions in order to vex him. But he was able to answer all these, having 
attained the patisambhidā. VibhA. 389.</p>
