  <h2>Attadanda Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>The fifteenth sutta of the Atthakavagga 
of the Sutta Nipata (Sn.182f). </p>
<p>It was preached by the Buddha when he 
went to settle the quarrel between the Sākiyans and the Koliyans. </p>
<p>It was the last to be preached on that 
occasion. At the end of the discourse their quarrels ceased and five hundred 
Sākiyan and five hundred Koliyan youths entered the Order by way of 
ehibhikkhupabbajjā (SnA.566-9; J.v.413-4). </p>
<p>The sutta deals with various aspects of 
self-control and a description of one who might be called a muni.</p>
