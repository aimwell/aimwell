<p><b>1. Senaka.</b> A minister of King Vedeha. See the 
Mahāummagga Jātaka, a large portion of which is devoted to the battle of wits 
between Senaka and Mahosadha. Senaka once killed a courtezan in order to take 
her ornaments (J.vi.382). He is identified with Saccaka. J.vi.478.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Senaka.</b> The Bodhisatta, born as a brahmin; he 
was the minister of Janaka, king of Benares. See the Sattabhasta Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Senaka.</b> The Bodhisatta, born as a brahmin; he 
was the minister of Madda, king of Benares. See the Dasannaka Jātaka.</p>

<p><b>4. Senaka. </b>King of Benares. See the Kharaputta 
Jātaka.</p>

<p><b>5. Senaka.</b> A monkey, born as the nephew of the 
Bodhisatta. See the Tinduka Jātaka. He is identified with Mahānāma the Sākyan.

<hr>
<p><b>6. Senaka Thera.</b> He was born in a brahmin family as 
the son of Uruvela-Kassapa’s sister. Senaka heard the Buddha preach at the 
Gayāphagguna festival, was converted, entered the Order, and attained 
arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he gave to the Buddha a 
handful of peacock feathers (Thag.vss.287-90; ThagA.i.388f). He is evidently 
identical with Morahatthiya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.403.</p>
