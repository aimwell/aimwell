<p>The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares. One day a cowherd 
left behind, inadvertently, a cow which was in calf, and a friendship sprang up 
between her and a lioness. The cow bore a calf and the lioness a cub, and these 
two young ones became Playmates. A forester seeing them together, reported the 
matter to the king, who wished to be informed should a third animal appear on 
the scene. A jackal, seeing the calf and the cub, and hoping for food, became 
friendly with them, and soon managed to make them quarrel. The king was informed 
of this, and by the time he arrived on the scene the two animals were dead.</p>
<p>The story was related to the Chabbaggiy훮 as a warning 
against their habit of back biting (J.iii.149ff).</p>
<p>This is probably the story referred to as the Sanghabheda 
J훮taka (J.iii.211).</p>
