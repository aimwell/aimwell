<p>A river in the Mahimsaka country, 
running out of Lake Sankhapāla. At the bend of the river and near its source was 
the mountain Candaka, near which the king of Magadha lived in a hut of leaves, 
and where he was visited by the Nāga Sankhapāla (J.v.162f). The river must have 
formed a lake at this bend, the lake being referred to as Kannpennā-daha 
(J.v.168).</p>
