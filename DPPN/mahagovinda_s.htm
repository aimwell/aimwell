<p>Pañcasikha visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta and tells him 
of a meeting once held in Tāvatimsa. At this meeting Sakka rejoices with the 
devas of Tāvatimsa over the increase in their numbers owing to the appearance in 
their midst of new devas produced by the good kamma of the followers of the new 
view of life put forward by the Buddha. Sakka expresses his joy in a song and 
then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha. Brahmā Sanankumāra 
appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his 
benefit. Sanankumāra says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the 
story of Disampati and his son Renu. Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and 
when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints 
Govinda’s son Jotipāla in his place.</p>
<p>On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with 
Jotipāla’s help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six 
of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being Dantapura, Potana, Māhissati, 
Roruka, Mithilā, Campā and Bārānasi; and the kings, respectively, are: Sattabhū, 
Brahmadatta, Vessabhū, Bharata, Renu and two Dhataratthas. Jotipāla, now called 
Mahāgovinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of 
stewards to the seven kings. Mahāgovinda acquires the reputation of having seen 
Brahmā face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of 
Renu and practises meditation for four months. During his meditation, 
Sanankumāra appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahmā face to face 
and attain communion with him. Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal 
brahmin. Mahāgovinda decides to leave the world and carry out the teachings of 
Sanankumāra. Having obtained the leave of his master, he enters the homeless 
life, where he practises the four ecstasies of love, pity, sympathy in joy and 
equanimity. He teaches these to his disciples, and, after death, they are all 
born into the Brahma world.</p>
<p>At the end of Pañcasikha’s recital, the Buddha tells him 
that he himself was Mahāgovinda and therefore remembers all that life. D.ii.220 
51; cp. Janavasabha Sutta, also Mtu.iii.197ff.</p>
<p>In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, brahmacariyā is explained as the 
four infinities (appamaññā), infinite love, etc. DA.i.178; MA.i.275.</p>
