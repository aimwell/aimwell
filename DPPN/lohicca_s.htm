<p><b>1. Lohicca Sutta</b>. The account of the visit of 
  Lohicca (1) (q.v.) of Makkarakata to Mahā Kaccāna. S.iv.117ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Lohicca Sutta</b>. The twelfth sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, containing the 
discussion between the Buddha and Lohicca of Sālāvatikā. The underlying argument 
of the sutta is that everyone should be allowed to learn; that everyone 
possessing certain attainments should be allowed to teach; but that if he does 
teach, he should teach all and to all, keeping nothing back, shutting no one 
out. But no man should take upon himself to teach unless he has first taught 
himself, and has acquired the faculty of imparting to others the truth he has 
gained himself. D.i.224ff.</p>
