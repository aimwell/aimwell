<p>Two parrots were once carried away by the wind during the 
moulting season. One of them fell among the weapons in a robber village and was 
called Sattigumba; the other fell in a hermitage among flowers and was called 
Pupphaka. He was the Bodhisatta. One day, Pañcāla, king of Uttarapañcāla, went 
out hunting. While chasing the deer with his charioteer, he was separated from 
his bodyguard and found himself in a glen near the robbers' village. There he 
slept. The robbers were absent, leaving only Sattigumba and a cook, named 
Patikolamba. The parrot, seeing the king, plotted with the cook to kill him. The 
king overheard the plan and fled with his charioteer. In his flight he came to 
the hermitage, where he was made welcome by Pupphaka till the return of the 
sages. The king told his story, and Pupphaka explained that though he and 
Sattigumba were brothers, heir upbringing had been different, which accounted 
for the difference in their natures. The king decreed immunity to all parrots 
and provided for the comfort of sages in his park.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta’s attempt to 
kill the Buddha by hurling a stone at him. Sattigamba is identified with 
Devadatta and the king with Ānanda. J.iv.430 7.</p>
