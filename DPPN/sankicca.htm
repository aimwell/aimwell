<h4><b>1. Sankicca Thera</b></h4>
<p>He was born in a very eminent brahmin family of Sāvatthi. 
His mother died just before his birth and was cremated, but he was found unburnt 
on the funeral pyre (Cf. the story of Dabba). The men who burnt his mother’s 
body, turning the pyre over with sticks, pierced the womb and injured the pupil 
of the child’s eye. Hence his name (Sankunā chinnakkhikotitāya = Sankicco). When 
he was discovered, they consulted soothsayers, who told them that if he lived in 
the household seven generations would be impoverished, but if he became a monk 
he would be the leader of five hundred. At the age of seven he came to know of 
his mother’s death and expressed a wish to join the Order. His guardians 
agreeing to this, he was ordained under Sāriputta. He won arahantship in the 
Tonsure hall (ThagA.i.533).</p>
<p>At that time, thirty men of Sāvatthi, who had entered the 
Order and had practised the duties of higher ordination for four years, wished 
to engage in meditation. The Buddha, foreseeing danger for them, sent them to 
Sāriputta. Sāriputta advised them to take with them the novice Sankicca, and 
they reluctantly agreed. After a journey of one hundred and twenty leagues, they 
came to a village of one thousand families, where they stayed at the request of 
the inhabitants, who provided all their needs. At the beginning of the rains, 
the monks agreed among themselves not to talk to one another; if any among them 
fell ill, he was to strike a bell. One day, as the monks were eating their meal 
on the banks of a neighbouring river, a poor man who had travelled far stood 
near them and they gave him some food. He then decided to stay with them, but 
after two months, wishing to see his daughter, he left the monks without a word. 
He travelled through a forest where lived five hundred robbers, who had vowed to 
offer a human sacrifice to a spirit of the forest.</p>
<p>As soon as they saw him, they captured him and prepared 
for the sacrifice. The man then offered to provide them with a victim of far 
higher status than himself, and led them to the monks. Knowing their habits, he 
struck the bell and they all assembled. When the robbers made known their 
design, each one of the monks offered himself as a victim, and in the end 
Sankicca, with&nbsp; great difficulty, persuaded the others to let him go. The 
thieves took Sankicca, and, when all was ready, the leader approached him with 
drawn sword. Sankicca entered into samādhi, and when the blow was struck, the 
sword buckled and bent at the end and split from hilt to top. Marvelling at 
this, the thieves did obeisance to Sankicca, and, after listening to his 
preaching, asked leave to be ordained. Sankicca agreed to this, and, having 
ordained them, took them to the other monks. There he took leave of them and 
went with his following to the Buddha. In due course, Sankicca received the 
higher ordination, and ten years later he ordained his sister’s son, Atimuttaka 
(Adhimuttaka), who, likewise, ordained five hundred thieves. DhA.ii.240ff.; for 
the story of Atimuttaka see Sankicca’s story is often referred to&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
e.g., Vsm.313; J.vi.14.</p>
<p>The <a href="nagapeta_v.htm" title="n/nagapeta_v.htm">Nāgapeta Vatthu</a> contains a story of another of Sankicca’s pupils (PvA.53ff). The Theragāthā (Thag. vs. 597-607) 
contains a series of stanzas spoken by Sankicca in praise of the charms of the 
forest in reply to a layman who, wishing to wait upon him, wished him to dwell 
in the village.</p>
<p>Sankicca is one of the four novices mentioned in the 
<a href="catusaamanera_va.htm" title="c/catusaamanera_va.htm">Catusāmanera Vatthu</a>. Sankicca’s iddhi is described as ñāvavipphāra iddhi. 
(Ps.ii.211; BuA.24). The iddhi referred to in this connection is Sankicca’s 
escape from death while his mother’s body was being burnt. Vsm., p.379.</p>
