  <h2>Gagga Jātaka (No.155)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a trader’s son 
in Kāsi. One day during their travels father and son were obliged to take 
lodging in a hall haunted by a yakkha. In the case of persons occupying this 
hall, if one of them should happen to sneeze and the other failed, thereupon, to 
wish him long life, the yakkha was allowed to eat them. This boon had been 
granted him in return for twelve years' services to Vessavana. The two 
travellers from Kāsi took up their abode in the hall for one night, during which 
the father sneezed. The son, knowing nothing of his danger, said nothing, but on 
seeing the yakkha preparing to eat him, he guessed the reason and hastened to 
wish his father long life. The father acted likewise, and the yakkha was foiled 
in his attempt on their lives. The Bodhisatta, having heard the yakkha’s story, 
established him in the five precepts. The story became known, and the Bodhisatta 
was given the post of general, while the yakkha was made tax-gatherer. In the 
story the Bodhisatta addresses his father as Gagga.</p>
<p>Once, when the Buddha was preaching, he 
sneezed, and all around him shouted “Long Life,” thus interrupting his sermon. 
The Buddha told them that the custom was superstitious, and forbade them to 
follow it. On their obeying him, the common people blamed them for their lack of 
good manners. The Buddha, thereupon, withdrew the injunction and related this 
story to account for the origin of the custom. (J.ii.15f.; the introductory 
story is found in Vin.ii.140).</p>
<p>Gagga is identified with Mahā Kassapa. 
J.ii.17.</p>
