  <h2>Parivārapātha (or Parivāra)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The concluding part of the Vinaya Pitaka. </p>
<p>It is a digest of the other parts of the Vinaya and 
consists of nineteen chapters. The colophon states that the book was the work of 
a monk named Dīpa, probably of Ceylon. </p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., DA.i.17; Sp.i.18), however, speak 
of the Solasa Parivāra as having formed part of the Vinaya when it was rehearsed 
at the First Council. Perhaps the Parivāras correspond to the mātikā of the 
Abhidhamma and were enlarged later on.</p>
