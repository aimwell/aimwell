<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a parrot named 
Rādha and his brother was Potthapāda. They were captured by a fowler and brought 
to the court of Dhanañjaya, king of Benares, where they were paid great 
attention. Later, a monkey, Kālabāhu, was added to the collection of animals, 
and the people in the palace lost interest in the parrots, much to the annoyance 
of Potthapāda. Soon, however, the children became frightened of the monkey’s 
tricks and he was sent away, just as Rādha had prophesied to his brother.</p>
<p>Ānanda was Potthapāda, and Devadatta, 
Kālabāhu.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempt to kill the Buddha by letting loose Nālāgiri. J.iii.97ff</p>
