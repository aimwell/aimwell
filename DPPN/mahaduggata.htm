<p>A very poor man of Benares in the time of Kassapa Buddha. 
The citizens of Benares once invited the Buddha and his monks and went about 
asking people to help in their entertainment. In spite of their extreme poverty, 
Mahāduggata and his wife undertook to look after one monk; they both worked hard 
to earn the necessary money and then prepared a simple meal. Sakka, knowing what 
was to come, came in the guise of a labourer to help them. When the time came 
for the meal it was found that in allotting the monks to their several hosts, 
Mahāduggata’s house had been overlooked. Mahāduggata wrung his hands and burst 
into tears, but somebody pointed out to him that nobody was yet entertaining the 
Buddha. He, therefore, went to the vihāra and invited the Buddha, who accepted 
the invitation, while princes and nobles waited outside wishing to conduct him 
to their own palaces. The Buddha ate the food prepared by Mahāduggata and Sakka 
and returned thanks. That same day, by the power of Sakka, the seven kinds of 
jewels fell from the sky and filled Mahāduggata’s house, and when it was 
reported to the king that he was the wealthiest man in the city, he was 
appointed Treasurer. Mahāduggata built a new house and discovered many hidden 
treasures while digging the foundations. With the money from these he 
entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days, and, after death, was 
reborn in heaven. </p>
