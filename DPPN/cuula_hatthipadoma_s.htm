  <h2>Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta</h2>

<p>Jānussoni, travelling in a carriage, 
meets Pilotika, from whom he hears praise of the Buddha. He learns how Pilotika, 
having heard the Buddha’s teachings to nobles, Brahmins, house-holders and 
recluses, was convinced that the Buddha was all-enlightened, just as an expert 
elephant-tracker seeing a broad elephant-footprint would conclude that it 
indicated the track of a really large elephant. Jānussoni goes to visit the 
Buddha and reports his conversation with Pilotika. The Buddha tells him it would 
be a mistake to conclude at once from seeing a broad footprint that it belonged 
to a very large elephant; there are many other possibilities which should first 
be eliminated. He then proceeds to describe the life of a real recluse, the 
disciple of the Noble One, and the attainments he reaches; these he calls the 
Truth-finder’s foot prints. Following this, the disciple makes further 
discoveries, till his mind is completely free from the āsavas, and then he 
realises the Truth-finder’s real quest. Jānussoni becomes a follower of the 
Buddha (M.i.175ff).</p>
<p>This was the first sutta preached in 
Ceylon by Mahinda to Devānampiyatissa. At the end of the discourse the king 
accepts the Three Refuges. Mhv.xiv.22.</p>
