<h4>1. Padumavatī</h4>
<p>Mother of five hundred Pacceka Buddhas. She was once a 
householder’s daughter in a village near Benares; one day, while guarding her 
father’s field, she saw a Pacceka Buddha, and gave him a lotus with five hundred 
grains of fried rice (lājā), making a wish to have five hundred sons. At that 
moment, five hundred hunters who stood by gave honey and flesh to the Pacceka 
Buddha and expressed their wish to be her sons. Later, she was born in a lotus 
pond, within a lotus. An ascetic, seeing her, brought her up. Wherever she went, 
lotuses sprang up at her every footstep. The King of Benares, hearing of her 
made her his chief consort. She gave birth to five hundred sons, the eldest 
being <a href="mahapaduma.htm" title="maha/mahapaduma.htm">Mahāpaduma</a>. All of them became Pacceka Buddhas (MA.ii.889).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikāya Commentary mentions that Padumavatī 
was a previous birth of the Therī Uppalavannā, and gives her story with much 
greater detail (i.188ff.; see s.v. <a href="uppalavanna.htm" title="u/uppalavanna.htm">Uppalavannā</a>, also ThigA.185ff).</p>
