<p>Wife of Pinguttara. She was the daughter 
of a teacher in Takkasilā and was given to Pinguttara because he was the eldest 
pupil. But he was unhappy with her, and on the way to his home, when she climbed 
up a fig (udumbara) tree to pluck fruits for herself, he put thorns round the 
tree and ran away, leaving her. The king, coming along, saw her and married her. 
She was called Udumbara-devi because of the circumstances in which she was 
found. When the king suspected her of infidelity to him, Mahosadha saved her 
from ignominy, and she became thereafter his best friend and helped him in all 
his doings, treating him, with the king’s permission, as her younger brother. 
When the king planned to kill Mahosadha, Udumbara-devi warned him in time and 
enabled him to evade the treachery of his enemies at court (J.vi.348, 352, 355, 
363, 368, 384).</p>
<p>In the present age she was 
Ditthamangalikā (J.vi.478). </p>
