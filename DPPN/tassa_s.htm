  <h2>Tassa-Sutam Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A group of suttas in which the Buddha is 
asked why beings are born among the different kinds of Nāgas. </p>
<p>He replies that it was because men who 
had practised double dealing, having heard that birth among Nāgas was happy, 
wish to be born there. S.iii.243f.</p>
