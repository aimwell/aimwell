<p>Once when Pasenadi was talking with the 
Buddha in the loggia outside the Migāramātupāsāda, there passed close by 
thirty-five ascetics of various denominations — Jatilas, Niganthas, etc. — and 
the king saluted them respectfully. Later, he asked the Buddha whether they were 
arahants or on the way to arahantship. The Buddha explained to him how hard it 
was for a layman, with all his encumbrances, to find an opportunity to learn the 
truth about arahants; much time and care and attention were necessary. The king 
agreed and mentioned how he gathered information through his spies. S.i.77f.</p>
