<p>A township which formed the eastern 
boundary of the Majjhimadesa. Beyond it was Mahāsālā (Vin.i.197; DA.i.173; 
MA.i.316, etc.; AA.i.55, etc.; J.i.49; Mbv.12). In the Buddha’s time it was a 
prosperous place where provisions could easily be obtained (dabbasambhārasulabhā) 
(J.iv.310). Once when the Buddha was staying in the Veluvana at Kajangala, the 
lay followers there heard a sermon from the Buddha and went to the nun Kajangalā 
to have it explained in detail (A.v.54f). On another occasion the Buddha stayed 
in the Mukheluvana and was visited there by Uttara, the disciple of Pārāsariya. 
Their conversation is recorded in the Indriyabhāvānā Sutta (M.iii.298ff). In the 
Milindapañha (p.10), Kajangala is described as a brahmin village and is given as 
the place of Nāgasena’s birth. In the Kapota Jātaka mention is made of Kajangala, 
and the scholiast (J.iii.226-7) explains that it may be the same as Benares. 
According to the scholiast of the Bhisa Jātaka (J.iv.311), the tree-spirit 
mentioned in that story was the chief resident monk in an old monastery in 
Kajangala, which monastery he repaired with difficulty during the time of 
Kassapa Buddha.</p>
<p>Kajangala is identified with the 
Kie-chu-hoh-khi-lo of Hiouen Thsang, which he describes as a district about two 
thousand li in circumference. (Beal, Bud. Records, ii.193, and n.; see also 
Cunningham, A.G.I.723). It may also be identical with the town Pundavardhana 
mentioned in the Divyāvadāna (p.21f). The Avadānasataka (ii.41) calls it 
Kacangalā.</p>
