  <h2>Velāma</h2>

</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as the chaplain of Benares. He was son 
of the preceding chaplain, and went with the crown prince to Takkasilā to study. 
There, in due course, he became a famous teacher, with eighty four thousand 
princes among his pupils. Later, he became chaplain to the Benares king. Every 
year the eighty four thousand princes came to Benares to pay their respects to 
the king, causing great suffering to the people. These complained to the king, 
and he asked Velāma to find a way out of the difficulty. Velāma marked out 
eighty four thousand provinces for the princes, and, thereafter, they obtained 
their supplies from their respective dominions.</p>
<p>Velāma was exceedingly wealthy and wished to give alms. 
Therefore, turning his water jar upside down, he wished that if there were holy 
men in the world, the water should flow downwards. The water, however, remained 
in the jar. He then discovered by the same means that his gifts would be free 
from blame. He thereupon held great almsgivings, distributing during seven years 
the seven precious things and gifts of great value, pouring forth his riches as 
though “making into one stream the five great rivers.” A list of his gifts is 
found at A.iv.393f. </p>
<p>Velāma’s story is given in AA.ii.802ff.; it is referred to 
in the Velāma&nbsp; Sutta and in the introductory story to the Khadirangāra 
Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
<p>Velāma’s almsgiving became famous in literature as the 
Velāmamahāyañña. E.g., MA.ii.616.</p>
