<p><b>1. Madhurā. </b>The capital of <a href="surasena.htm" title="s/surasena.htm">Surasena</a>, situated on the 
<a href="yamunaa.htm" title="y/yamunaa.htm">Yamunā</a>. Its king, 
soon after the death of Bimbisāra, was Avantiputta (M.ii.83), who, judging by 
his name, was probably related to the royal family of Ujjeni. Madhurā was 
visited by the Buddha (A.ii.57; iii.256), but there is no record of his having 
stayed there. In fact, the Madhura Sutta (2) (q.v.) states that he viewed the 
city with distinct disfavour. But Mahā Kaccāna evidently liked it, for he stayed 
there in the Gundāvana, and was visited there by the king of the city, 
Avantiputta (M.ii.83), and the brahmin Kandarāyana (A.i.67). One of the most 
important suttas on caste, the <a href="madhura_s.htm" title="ma/madhura_s.htm">Madhura Sutta 1</a>, was preached to Avantiputta by Mahā Kaccāna at Madhurā. Perhaps it was 
through the agency of Mahā Kaccāna that Buddhism gained ground in Madhurā. 
Already in the Buddha’s time there were, in and around Madhurā, those who 
accepted his teachings, for the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.57) mentions that once 
when he was journeying from Madhurā to Verañjā and stopped under a tree by the 
wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped 
him. Later, about 300 B.C., Madhurā became a Jain centre (CHI.i.167), but when 
Fa Hsien (Giles, p. 20) and Hiouen Thsang visited it, Buddhism was flourishing 
there, and there were many sanghārāmas and stūpas. Beal.i.179ff.; for a prophecy 
(attributed to the Buddha) regarding the future greatness of Madhurā, see 
Dvy.348ff.</p>
<p>From Sankassa to Madhurā was a distance of four yojanas 
(thus in Kaccāyana’s Grammar, iii.1).</p>
<p>Madhurā is sometimes referred to as Uttara Madhurā, to 
distinguish it from a city of the same name in South India. Thus, in the 
Vimānavatthu Commentary (VvA.118f), a woman of Uttara Madhurā is mentioned as 
having been born in Tāvatimsa as a result of having given alms to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The Ghata Jātaka (J.iv.79ff) speaks of Mahāsāgara as the 
king of Uttara<span lang="en-us"> Madhurā, and 
relates what is evidently the story of Kamsa’s attempt to tyrannize over Madhurā 
by overpowering the Yādavas and his consequent death at the hands of Krsna, a 
story which is found both in the Epics and in the Purānas. This Jātaka confirms 
the Brahmanical tradition as to the association of Vasudeva’s family with 
Madhurā (PHAL, p. 89).</p>
<p>There is a story (Cv.xcii.23ff ) of a king called Mahāsena 
of Pātaliputta, who was very generous in feeding the monks, and once thought of 
giving alms by cultivating a piece of land himself. He, therefore, went to 
Uttara Madhurā in disguise, worked as a labourer, and held an almsgiving with 
the gains so obtained.</p>
<p>Madhurā is generally identified with Maholi, five miles to 
the Southeast of the present town of Mathurā or Muttra. It is the Modura of 
Ptolemy and the Methoras of Pliny (CAGI. 427f).</p>
<p>The Milindapañha (p. 331) refers to Madhurā as one of the 
chief cities of India. In the past, Sādhina and twenty two of his descendants, 
the last of whom was Dhammagutta, reigned in Madhurā (Dpv.iii.21).</p>

<p><b>2. Madhurā. </b>A city in South India, in the Madras Presidency, and now 
known as Madura. It is generally referred to as Dakkhina-Madhurā, 
to distinguish it from (Uttara-)Madhura on the Yamunā. 
Dakkhina-Madhurā was the second capital of the Pandyan kingdom (their first 
being Korkai, see Vincent Smith, EHI.335ff), and there was constant intercourse 
between this city and Ceylon. From Madhurā came the consort of Vijaya, first 
king of Ceylon, and she was accompanied by many maidens of various families who 
settled in Ceylon (Mhv.vii.49ff). Sena II. sent an army to pillage Madhurā, and 
set upon the throne a Pandu prince who had begged for his support (Cv.li.27ff). 
Later, Madhurā was attacked by Kulasekhara, and its king, Parakkama, sought the 
assistance of Parakkamabāhu I. of Ceylon. The latter sent an army under his 
general Lankāpura, but in the meantime the Pāndyan king had been slain and his 
capital taken. The Singhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and 
carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress near Rāmnād, which they 
called Parakkamapura. They managed to defeat Kulasekhara and restore the crown 
of Madhurā to the Pāndyan king’s son, Vīra Pandu. The captives taken by the army 
were sent to Ceylon. For details see Cv.lxxvi.76ff.; lxxvii.1ff.; see also 
Cv.Trs.ii.100, n. 1.</p>
<p>Rājasīha II. is said to have obtained wives from Madhurā 
(Cv.xcvi.40), as did his successors Vimaladhammasūriya II., Narindasīha and 
Vijayarājasīha. Ibid., xcvii.2, 24; xcviii.4.</p>
