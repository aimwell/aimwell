<p>1. Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See 
Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika — according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to 
be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika. It contains the verses preached by the Buddha 
to Kokālika. The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that 
await the back-biter after death. The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses 
(657-78). The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas 
are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong 
to the original sutta. Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are 
called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered 
by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according 
to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker. The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in 
the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu. In the Anguttara Nikāya 
(v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), 
also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.</p>
<p>2. Kokālika Sutta.-Gives the story of 
Kokālika (2) speaking ill of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before the Buddha, of 
Kokālika’s illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement 
of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatī to the 
Buddha. A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the 
Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various 
illustrations. The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu’s 
verses. A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.</p>
<p>3. Kokālika Sutta.-Subrahmā visits the 
Buddha at Sāvatthi and utters verses in reference to Kokālika. The man who tries 
to limit the illimitable becomes confused. S.i.148.</p>
