  <h2>Yakkha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of non human beings generally described as 
amanussÄ. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, DÄnavas, Gandhabbas, 
Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? NÄgas) (E.g., J.v.420).  </p>
<p>In other lists (E.g., PvA. 
45, 55) they range immediately above the Petas; in fact, some of the happier 
Petas are called Yakkhas. Elsewhere (E.g., A.ii.38) they rank, in progressive 
order, between manussÄ and gandhabbÄ. They are of many different kinds: spirits, 
ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, yakkha, like nÄgÄ, as an 
appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the 
gods, so referred to (M.i.252; J.iv.4; DA.i.264), but even the Buddha is spoken 
of as a yakkha in poetic diction (M.i.386). Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so 
addressed (S.i.54).  </p>
<p>According to a passage in the VimÄnavatthu Commentary, 
(VvA.333) which gives illustrations, the term is used for Sakka, the Four Regent 
Gods (MahÄrÄjÄno), the followers of Vessavana, and also for puriso (individual 
soul?). In the scholiast to the Jayadissa JÄtaka (J.v.33), the figure of the 
hare in the moon is also called yakkha. Of these above named, the followers of 
Vessavana appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term yakkha as applied to purisa 
is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning â€œsoulâ€ in 
such passages as ettÄvatÄ yakkhassa suddhi (SN.vs.478), or ettÄvat' aggam no 
vadanti h' ekÄ, yakkhassa suddhim idha pÄnditÄse (SN.vs.875).  </p>
<p>In the Niddesa 
(MNid.282), yakkha is explained by satta, nara, mÄnava, posa, puggala, jÄ«va, 
jagu, jantu, indagu, manuja. The last term is significant as showing that yakkha 
also means â€œman.â€</p>
<p>The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from 
the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the 
latter origin belong the stories connected with vimÄnas found in or near the sea 
or in lakes. The worship of trees and the spirits inhabitating them is one of 
the most primitive forms of religion. Some, at least, of the yakkhas are called 
rukkha devatÄ (E.g., J.iii.309, 345; Pv.i.9; PvA.5) (spirits of trees), and 
others bhummadevatÄ, (PvA.45,55) (spirits of the earth), who, too, seem to have 
resided in trees. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, 
beings half deified, having a devaâ€™s supernormal powers, particularly as regards 
influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called 
devatÄ (E.g., S.i.205), or devaputta (E.g., PvA. 113, 139). Some of these, like 
IndakÅ«ta and Suciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and 
ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at 
will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any 
shape at will. An epithet frequently applied is mahiddhika (E.g., Pv.ii.9; 
J.vi.118). Their appearance is striking as a result of former good kamma 
(Pv.i.2, 9; ii.11; iv.3, etc.). They are also called kÄmakÄmÄ«, enjoying all 
kinds of luxuries (Pv.i.3), but, because of former bad kamma, they are possessed 
of odd qualities, thus they are shy, they fear palmyra leaf and iron. Their eyes 
are red and they neither wink nor cast a shadow. J.iv.492; v.34; vi.336, 337; 
these various characteristics are, obviously, not found in all Yakkhas. The 
Yakkhas are evidently of different grades&nbsp;-&nbsp; as is the case with all 
classes of beings – the highest among them approximate very nearly to the devas 
and have deva-powers, the lowest resemble petas. The Yakkhas are specially 
mentioned as being afraid of palm leaves (J.iv.492).</p>
<p>Their abode is their self created palace, which is 
anywhere, in the air, in trees, etc. These are mostly Äkasattha (suspended in 
the air), but some of them, like the abode of Ä€lavaka, are bhumattha (on the 
ground) and are described as being fortified (SNA.i.222). Sometimes whole cities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
e.g., Ä€lakamandÄ&nbsp;&nbsp; stand under the protection of, or are inhabited by, 
Yakkhas.</p>
<p>In many respects they resemble the Vedic PisÄcas, though 
they are of different origin. They are evidently remnants of an ancient 
demonology and have had incorporated in them old animistic beliefs as 
representing creatures of the wilds and the forests, some of them based on 
ethnological features. (See Stede: Gespenstergeschichten des Petavatthu v.39ff 
).</p>
<p>In later literature the Yakkhas have been degraded to the 
state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (YakkhinÄ«) are, in these 
cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood 
(J.iv.549; v.34); and devour even men (D.ii.346; J.ii.15ff.) and corpses 
(J.i.265). They eat babies (J.v.21; vi.336) and are full of spite and vengeance 
(DhA.i.47; ii.35f.). The story of BhÅ«ta Thera is interesting because his elder 
brothers and sisters were devoured by a hostile Yakkha, so the last child is 
called BhÅ«ta to propitiate the Yakkha by making him the childâ€™s sponsor!</p>
<p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one 
of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings 
with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the 
AtÄnÄtiya Sutta (D.iii.194f), however, the Yakkha king, Vessavana, is 
represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe 
neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers 
abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the 
Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in 
their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill SÄriputta 
(Ud.iv.4). But the MahÄ Yakkhas (a list in D.iii.204f), the generals and 
commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent 
wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are 
sotÄpannas&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., Janavasabha, Suciloma and Khara (s.v.). Some 
Yakkhas even act as messengers from another world, and will save prospective 
sinners from committing evil (Pv.iv.1). The case of the Yakkha VajirapÄni is of 
special interest. D.i.95. The Commentary (DA.i.264) says he is not an ordinary 
Yakkha, but Sakka himself.</p>
<p>He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the 
air, threatening to kill Ambattha, if he does not answer the Buddhaâ€™s question 
the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are â€œfallen angelsâ€ and 
come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to 
a higher sphere of existence&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., PiyankaramÄtÄ and PunabbasumÄtÄ, 
and even Vessavana, listening to VelukandakÄ« NandamÄtÄ reciting the ParÄyana 
Vagga (A.iv.63). At the preaching of the MahÄsamaya Sutta (q.v.) many hundreds 
of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out (Stede, op. cit) that the names of 
the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken 
from (a) their bodily appearance&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., KuvannÄ, Khara, Kharaloma, 
KharadÄthika, Citta, CittarÄja, Silesaloma, SÅ«ciloma and HÄritÄ; (b) their place 
of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
e.g., AjakalÄpaka, Ä€lavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), 
KumbhÄ«ra, Gumbiya, DisÄmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, VajirapÄni or VajirabÄhu, 
SÄtÄgira, SerÄ«saka; (c) qualities of character, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., Adhamma, 
Katattha, Dhamma, Punnaka, MÄra, Sakata; (d) embodiments of former persons&nbsp;&nbsp; 
e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= BimbisÄra), DÄ«gha, Naradeva, Pandaka, SÄ«vaka, 
SerÄ«.</p>
<p>Vessavana (q.v.) is often mentioned as king of the 
Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Ä€tÄnÄtiya Sutta 
(D.iii.199ff) contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, 
with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly 
halls. Vessavana is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and 
messengers. They wait upon him in turn. The YakkhinÄ«s draw water for him, and 
often are so hard worked that many die in his service. E.g., J.iv.492. Mention 
is also made (e.g., DA.ii.370) of YakkhadÄsÄ«s who have to dance and sing to the 
devas during the night. Early in the morning they drink a cup of toddy (surÄ) 
and go off into a deep sleep, from which they rise betimes in the evening ready 
for their duties.</p>
<p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting 
upon the king&nbsp;&nbsp; even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavana 
(D.ii.207). Among the duties of Vessavana is the settling of disputes between 
the devas, and this keeps him (J.vi.270) much occupied. In this work he is 
helped by the YakkhasenÄpati, whose business it is to preside over the courts 
during eight days of each mouth (SNA.i.197). The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies 
on ManosilÄtala on the BhagalavatÄ«pabbata (SNA.i.187; cp. D.iii.201 and 
DA.iii.967). As followers of Kuvera, lord of riches, the Yakkhas are the 
guardians and the liberal spenders of underground riches, hidden treasures, 
etc., with which they delight men. E.g., Pv.ii.11; PvA.145; Pv.iv.12; PvA.274. 
These were seven yakkhas who guarded the wealth of Jotiyasetthi (DhA.iv.208f.).</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas, who are the 
aborigines of Ceylon (LankÄ), were considered human or non human. KuvenÄ«, one of 
their princesses, and her maid, can both assume different forms, but Vijaya 
marries Kuveni and has two children by her. (Cp. Vin.iii.37; iv. 20; where 
sexual intercourse with a Yakkha is forbidden). The Yakkhas are invisible, and 
Vijaya is able to kill them only with the help of Kuveni (Mhv.vii.36); but their 
clothes are found fit for Vijaya and his followers to wear (Mhv.vii.38). Again, 
CetiyÄ (q.v.) could make herself invisible and assume the form of a mare, but 
PandukÄbhaya lived with her for four years and she gave him counsel in battle. 
Later, when he held festivities, he had the Yakkha CittarÄja on the throne 
beside him (Mhv.x.87). In all probability these Yakkhas were originally 
considered as humans, but later came to be confused with non humans. Their chief 
cities were LankÄpura and SirÄ«savatthu.</p>
<p>The commonly accepted etymology of Yakkha is from the root 
yaj, meaning to sacrifice. Thus: yajanti tattha balim upaharantÄ« ti yakkha 
(VvA.224), or pÅ«janÄ«yabhÄvato yakkho, ti uccati (VvA.333).</p>
