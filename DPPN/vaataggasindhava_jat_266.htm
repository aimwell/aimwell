<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as the state horse of the 
king of Benares, his name being Vātaggasindhava. A she ass, Kundalī, fell in 
love with him and refused to eat. Her son discovered this, and made the horse 
agree to come and see her after his bathe. But when the horse came, Kundalī, not 
wishing to make herself cheap, kicked him on the jaw and nearly killed him. The 
horse was ashamed and did not repeat his visit, and Kundalī died of love.</p>
<p>The story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi, with whom a 
beautiful woman fell desperately in love. Her friends, with great difficulty, 
persuaded him to visit her one night, but she was capricious and rejected his 
advances. He went away never to return, and she died of love. When he heard of 
her death, he sought the Buddha, who told him the story. The she ass is 
identified with the woman. J.ii.337ff.</p>
