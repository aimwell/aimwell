<h2>Mahā Sangharakkhita </h2>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahā Sangharakkhita Thera.</b> An arahant. He came, 
with forty thousand others, from Dakkhināgiri vikāra in Ujjeni, to the 
Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.35) and took up his position at 
the western entrance. MT. 530.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahā Sangharakkhita.</b> A monk of Corakandaka 
vihāra; one of those who accepted the meal given by Prince Sāliya in his 
previous birth as a blacksmith. MT. 606.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahā Sangharakkhita.</b> Called Malayavāsi Mahā 
Sangharakkhita or Uparimandalakamalayavāsī. Tissabhūti went to him, on finding 
his mind corrupted by sinful thoughts, and having received from Sangharakkhita a 
topic of meditation, he attained to arahantship (AA.i.23f.; MA.i.55). He was one 
of the last of the arahants. J. L. Makārakkhira.<span lang="en-us">

Commentaries as being free from impurities. E.g., MA.i.525; Vsm.104; DhSA.268.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Mahā Sangharakkhita Thera.</b> When over sixty years 
old and about to die, his companions questioned him on his transcendental 
attainment. “I have none,” he replied. A young monk who waited on him said that 
people had come from twelve yojanas round in the belief that he had attained 
Nibbāna. He then asked that he should be raised up and left alone. As soon as 
the others left him, he snapped his fingers to show that he had attained 
arahantship. He confessed that he had never done anything without mindfulness 
and understanding. His nephew also attained arahantship only after fifty years 
of age. Vsm.47f.</p>
