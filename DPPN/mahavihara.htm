<h2>Mahāvihāra</h2>
<p>The great monastery at Anurādhapura, for many centuries 
the chief seat of Buddhism in Ceylon. It was founded by Devānampiyatissa, on the 
counsel of Mahinda, and included the Mahāmeghavana. The Mahāmeghavanārāma 
henceforth came to be included in the Mahāvihāra. The boundary of the vihāra was 
marked out by the king ploughing a circular furrow starting from near the 
Gangalatittha on the Kadambanadī and ending again at the river (Mhv.xv.188ff.; 
MT.361; Mbv. 135, 136 says that the ford on the Kadambanadī was Pāsānatittha).  </p>
<p>A 
list is given in the Mahābodhivamsa (pp. 135f) of the places through which the 
simā (boundary) of the Mahāvihāra passed&nbsp;-&nbsp; Pāsānatittha, 
Kuddavātakapāsāna, Kumbhakāraāvāta, the Mahānīpa tree, Kakudhapāli, Mahāangana 
tree, Khujjamātula tree, Marutta pokkharanī, the northern gate of the Vijayārāma 
park, Gajakumbhakapāsāna, then passing Avattimajjha, Bālakapāsāna on the 
Abhayavāpi, Mahāsusāna, Dīghapāsāna, the left side of Candalagāma, the 
Nīcasusāna to the left of Kammāradeva Sīmānigrodha, Veluvangana, round the 
hermitages of the Niganthas Jotiya Giri and Kumbhanda, to the right of the 
various hermitages of the Paribbājakas, by Hiyagalla, along the shrine of the 
brahmin Dīyavāsa, through Telumapāli, Tālacatukka, to the right of the stables (assamandala), 
on to Sasakapāsāna and Marumbatittha. It then proceeded up the river to 
Sīhasinānatittha, on to Pāsānatittha, ending at Kuddavātakapāsāna.</p>
<p>The Mahāvihāra contained thirty two Mālakas (Mhv.xv.214) 
and had numerous buildings attached to it, apart from sacred shrines, such as 
the Mahābodhi tree, Thūpārāma, Mahā Thūpa, etc. In its early period, the 
precincts of the Mahāvihāra contained other buildings besides those dedicated to 
the service of Buddhism&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., the hermitages of the Niganthas and 
the Paribbājakas (as mentioned above) and the shrine of the guardian deity of 
Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxv.87). In the time of Vattagāmanī, the Mahāvihāra monks 
divided into two factions, and one party occupied Abhayagiri, built by the king 
(Mhv.xxxiii.97f). At first the differences between these two factions were 
trivial, but, as time went on, Abhayagiri grew in power and riches and proved a 
formidable rival to the older monastery.</p>
<p>From time to time various kings and nobles made additions 
and restorations to the Mahāvihāra. Thus Vasabha (Mhv.xxxxv.88) built a row of 
cells, and Bhātikatissa erected a boundary wall (Mhv.xxxvi.2), while 
Kanitthatissa removed the boundary wall and constructed the Kukkutagiri parivena, 
twelve large pāsādas, a refectory, and a road leading from Mahāvihāra to 
Dakkhinavihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.10f). Vohārikatissa appointed a monthly gift of a 
thousand to the monks of Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.32), while Sirisanghabodhi built 
a salāka house (Mhv.xxxvi.74). Gothābhaya erected a stone pavilion and made a 
padhānabhūmi to the west of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.102,106).</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of Gothābhaya’s reign, a dispute 
arose between the Mahāvihāra and Abhayagiri on matters of doctrine, and sixty 
monks of Abhayagiri, who had adopted the Vetulyavāda, were banished. They 
obtained the assistance of a Cola monk, named Sanghatissa, and at a solemn 
assembly of the monks concerned, at Thūpārāma, Sanghamitta expounded his 
heretical doctrine, refuting the opposition of the Mahāvihāra monks, and 
succeeded in winning over the king, who was present, in spite of the efforts of 
his uncle, Gothābhaya Thera, to bring him round to the orthodox party. 
Sanghamitta became tutor to the king’s sons, and when one of these, Mahāsena, 
became king, he prompted him to destroy the Mahāvihāra. A royal decree was 
issued forbidding the giving of alms to the Mahāvihāra. The monks thereupon left 
the monastery, and for nine years it remained deserted. Many of the buildings 
were destroyed, and various possessions belonging to the Mahāvihāra were removed 
to Abhayagiri; but the people, led by the king’s minister and friend, 
Meghavannābhaya, revolted against the impious deeds of Mahāsena and his 
admirers, Sanghamitta and Sona, and the king was forced to yield. Sanghamitta 
and Sona were slain by one of the queens, and the king, with the help of 
Meghavannābhaya, rebuilt several parivenas and restored some of the possessions, 
which had been removed. But Mahāsena’s allegiance to the Mahāvihāra teaching was 
not lasting; acting on the advice of a monk named Tissa, he built the 
Jetavanavihāra in the grounds of the Mahāvihāra, against the wish of the monks 
there; the latter left again for nine months as a sign of protest against the 
king’s attempts to remove the boundary of the vihāra. This attempt, however, he 
was forced to abandon (Mhv.xxxvi.110f.; xxxvii.1 37).</p>
<p>Mahāsena’s son, Sirimeghavanna, on coming to the throne, 
exerted himself to undo the damage which had been wrought by his father. He 
rebuilt the Lohapāsāda and restored all the demolished parivenas, together with 
their endowments (Cv.xxxvii.54ff). Mahāvihāra had, by now, become famous as a 
seat of learning; it was the centre of Theravāda Buddhism, and was the 
repository of various Commentaries, of which the chief were the Sīhalatthakathā 
on the Pāli Canon. Thither, therefore, came scholars from various countries, 
among them Buddhaghosa (q.,v.), who resided in the Ganthākara parivena and 
compiled his Pāli Commentaries (Cv.xxxvii.215ff).</p>
<p>When Dhātusena became king he had the walls of the 
Mahāvihāra painted with various ornamental designs (Cv.xxxviii.43). The 
Dhammarucikas seem to have been favourites of this king and to have occupied the 
Mahāvihāra, later moving to Ambatthala vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.75). Mahānāga 
instituted a permanent distribution of soup to the inhabitants of the Mahāvihāra 
(Cv.xli.99) and Jetthatissa III. planted another Bodhi tree there, called the 
Mahāmetta (Cv.xliv.96).</p>
<p>Udaya I. built a new salāka hall (Cv.xlix.14). Aggabodhi 
IX. discontinued the habit of the monks of the smaller vihāras surrounding 
Anurādhapura from coming to Mahāvihāra for their supply of medicines and made 
other arrangements for their distribution (Cv.xlix.88). Sena I. and his queen 
Sanghā erected and endowed the Sanghasena parivena (Cv.l.70), while Kassapa IV. 
built the Samuddagiri parivena and gave it for the use of the Pamsukūlikas, 
while for the forest dwelling monks of Mahāvihāra he built forest dwellings 
(Cv.lii.21f.; Cv. Trs.i.163, n.8). Kassapa’s kinsman, the general Rakkha, built 
a vihāra in the village of Savāraka and gave it to the incumbents of Mahāvihāra, 
to be used as a padhānaghara, while Mahālekhasena built, in Mahāvihāra itself, 
the Mahālekhapabbata (Cv.lii.31ff). Udaya IV. gave a diadem of jewels to the 
Buddha image in Mahāvihāra, while his wife Vidurā added to it a network of rays 
made of precious stones (Cv.liii.49ff).</p>
<p>During the invasions of the Colas and the Pandus from 
South India, and owing to the consequent confusion prevailing in the country, 
the Mahāvihāra seems to have been neglected. Many of the buildings were 
destroyed and their priceless possessions plundered. Discipline among the monks 
became slack and there were many dissensions. Later, when Parakkamabāhu I. had 
restored peace, he wished to purify the religion, but met with great opposition, 
and it was only after strenuous efforts that he brought about a reconciliation 
between the different parties (Cv.lxxviii.11ff).</p>
<p>It is said (Cv.lxxviii.25) that the king could not find 
one single pure member of the Order. He, therefore, held a special ordination 
ceremony, admitting many monks into the Order.  </p>
<p>After the removal of the capital 
from Anurādhapura to Pulatthipura, Mahāvihāra lost its importance; the centre of 
activity was now at Pulatthipura, and later, at other capitals, and the 
Mahāvihāra fell into neglect and decay, from which it has never recovered.</p>
