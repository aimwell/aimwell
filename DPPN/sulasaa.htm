<p><b>1. Sulasā.</b> A nagarasobhinī (courtezan) of Benares; 
See the <a href="sulasa_jat_419.htm">Sulasā Jātaka</a>.</p>

<p><b>2. Sulasā. </b>A nagarasobhinī (courtezan) of Rājagaha. 
One day she saw the son of Mahādhanasetthi being led to execution for his crimes 
and, feeling compassion for him because she had once enjoyed his patronage, she 
sent him four cakes and some drink. Moggallāna appeared before him as soon as 
the cakes were given to him, and the condemned man offered them to the Elder. 
After death he was born as a devatā on a nigrodha-tree in the park near the 
city. One day, when Sulasā entered the park, the deity, creating a great 
darkness, carried her away. Seven days later he took her to Veluvana and left 
her there on the edge of the crowd who were listening to the Dhamma. When she 
related her experiences, the people were at first inclined to laugh at her; but 
her story was verified, and they were amazed. The story was reported to the 
Buddha, who made it the subject for a sermon. Pv.i.1; PvA.4f. It is probably 
this story which is repeated at Milinda, p.350, as the “assembly of Sulasā.”</p>
