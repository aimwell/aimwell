<p>Once, the Bodhisatta was a brahmin who, 
having studied at Takkasilā, became an ascetic in the Himālaya region, living 
only in standing and walking attitudes. One day a tree-sprite appeared before 
him and asked him a riddle about waking and sleeping, which he solved to her 
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
certain layman who was a Sotāpanna. He was once travelling with a caravan along 
a forest road. When the caravan halted for the night it was attacked by robbers. 
But seeing the layman walking to and fro all night they stopped their attack and 
reported the matter to their leader. The layman was greatly honoured and, on 
arriving at Sāvatthi, told the Buddha of it.</p>
<p>The tree-sprite is identified with 
Uppalavannā (J.iii.403f).</p>
