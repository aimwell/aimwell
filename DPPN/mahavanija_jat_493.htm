<h2>Mahāvānija Jātaka (No. 493)</h2>
<p>A company of merchants once went astray in the forest 
without food or water, and, seeing a huge banyan-tree with moist branches, they 
out off a branch and water poured out, from another branch came food, from 
another a company of girls, and from the fourth various precious things. 
Overcome by greed, they wished to cut the tree from its roots in order to get 
more. Their leader, the Bodhisatta, tried to prevent this, but they refused to 
listen. Then the Nāga king who lived in the tree, ordered his followers to slay 
all the merchants except the leader. Him the Nāgas escorted to his home with all 
the treasures.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a company of merchants 
from Sāvatthi, followers of the Buddha, who had a similar experience. But having 
moderate desires, they made no attempt to cut down the tree. Then they returned 
to Sāvatthi, and, offering some of the precious things to the Buddha, made over 
the merit thereof to the deity of the tree. The Buddha praised them for their 
moderation. Sāriputta is identified with the Nāga king. J.iv.350ff.</p>
