<p>One of the sixteen disciples of Bāvarī, who, at his 
request, visited the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (SN.vs.1008). </p>
<p>He questioned the Buddha as to how a man could get over 
attachment and cross the flood. By grasping after nothing in the world, answered 
the Buddha, for <a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> follows the man who clings to things.</p>
<p>This question and 
answer are contained in the Bhadrāvudhamānava-puccha 
(SN.vs.1101-4), which is explained in the Culla Niddesa (CNid.36f).  </p>
<p>At the end 
of the discourse, Bhadrāvudha and his pupils became arahants and joined the 
Order. SNA.ii.599.</p>
