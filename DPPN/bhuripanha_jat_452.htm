  <h2>Bhūripañha Jātaka (No.452)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a section of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka, 
which describes how Mahosadha, having lost the king’s favour, lived with a 
potter. The deity of the king’s parasol put several questions to the king, but 
his wise men (Senaka and others) were unable to answer them. The king then sent 
messengers with gifts to look for Mahosadha; they found him in the potter’s hut 
and brought him back. The king expressed surprise that Mahosadha should have 
borne him no resentment. Mahosadha pointed out to him that wise men were 
incapable of ingratitude or meanness. J.vi.372-6.</p>
