  <h2>Kakkara Jātaka (No. 209)</h2>
  </li>

<p>The story of a wise bird who, seeing a 
farmer trying to catch him, avoided him till the farmer was quite exasperated. 
In the end the farmer camouflaged himself like a tree, but the bird laughed in 
his face.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk, a fellow-celibate of Sāriputta. This monk was very careful about his body, 
and earned the reputation of a dandy. The bird is identified with the monk 
(J.ii.161f). This story bears some resemblance to the second Sakuntaka Jātaka in 
the Mahāvastu, particularly to the latter part of it. v.l. Kukkura.</p>
<p>Mtu.ii.250.</p>
