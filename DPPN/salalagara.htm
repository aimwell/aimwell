<p><b>Salalāgāra, Salalaghara. </b>A building in Jetavana. 
Once when Sakka went to visit the Buddha he found him in the Salalāgāra, wrapt 
in samādhi, with Bhuñjatī waiting on him. Sakka therefore left a message with 
her (D.ii.270). Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.705) defines it as salalamayagandhakuti. 
Elsewhere, where (SA.iii.205) he says it was a hut of salala trees (salalarukkhamaya) 
or a hut with a salala tree at its door. In the Commentary to the Mahāpadāna 
Sutta (DA.ii.407) the Salalaghara is spoken of as one of the four chief 
buildings, (mahāgehāni) of Jetavana. It was built by 
Pasenadi at a cost of one hundred thousand. Anuruddha is also mentioned as 
having stayed there. S.v.300.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Salalāgāra Sutta.</b> Anuruddha, addressing the monks 
at the Salalāgāra, tells them that it is as difficult, to make a, monk who has 
developed the four satipatthānas return to the lower life, as to make the Ganges 
flow westward. S.v.300f.</p>
