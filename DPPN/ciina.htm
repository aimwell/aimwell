<p>The Pāli name of China. It is several 
times mentioned in the Milindapañha (121, 327), once as a place where ships 
congregate (359). Nāgasena speaks (121) of a contemporary Cīnarājā who could 
charm the ocean by an Act of Truth and could enter the ocean to a distance of 
one league in his chariot drawn by lions, the waves rolling back at his 
approach. </p>
<p>The Apadāna (ii.359) speaks of the 
Cīnarattha in a list of countries and tribes. </p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., VibbA.159) speak 
of the softness of Chinese silk (Cīnapata).</p>
