<p>A <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> of 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>, son of 
<a href="anjana.htm" title="ay/anjana.htm">Añjana</a> 
and <a href="yasodharaa.htm" title="y/yasodharaa.htm">Yasodharā</a>.  </p>
<p>His brother was
<a href="suppabuddha.htm" title="s/suppabuddha.htm">Suppabuddha</a> and his sisters 
<a href="mahamaayaa.htm" title="maha/mahamaayaa.htm">Māyā</a> and 
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Pajāpatī</a>. He 
was the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> maternal uncle (Mhv.ii.19). He was born in 
<a href="devadaha.htm" title="d/devadaha.htm">Devadaha</a> (MT.137). 
 
</p>
<p>According to northern sources (E.g., Rockhill: p.20) Prince 
<a href="siddhattha.htm" title="s/siddhattha.htm">Siddhattha’s</a> wife 
was Dandapānī’s daughter. It is recorded (M.i.108) that Dandapānī once met the 
Buddha in Kapilavatthu and questioned him on his teachings. The 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> explained 
them to him, but he was not satisfied, and went away “shaking his head, wagging 
his tongue, with his brow puckered into three wrinkles.”</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (MA.i.298) he received 
his name from the fact of his always being seen with a golden walking-stick and 
that he was a follower of <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>.</p>
