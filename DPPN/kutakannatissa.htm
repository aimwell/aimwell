</ul>
<p>Second son of Mahācūli and king of 
Ceylon (16-38 A.C.). He had entered the Order through fear of the infamous Anulā, 
but later he led an army against her and slew her. He founded the Pelagāma-vihāra, 
built the Vannaka canal, and laid out the Padumassara park. He founded, for his 
mother, a nunnery called the Dantageha. He had also constructed a wall, seven 
cubits high, round Anurādhapura. Bhātikābhaya was his son and successor 
(Mhv.xxxiv.28ff). The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xviii.37; but see xx.31, where he is called 
Tissa and his son Nāga) appears to call him Kutikanna-Abhaya, and speaks of him 
as a very devoted supporter of the nuns.</p>
<p>Kutakanna had a horse of the Ājānīya 
race called Gulavanna (SA.i.27; MA.ii.654).</p>
<p>Two theras are mentioned in the Vibhanga 
Commentary (VibhA.452) as having been held in special esteem by the king — 
Cūlasudhamma Thera of Girigāmakanna and Tipitaka-Cūlanāga Thera.</p>
