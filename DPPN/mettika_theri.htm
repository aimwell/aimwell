<p>She was born in a rich brahmin family of Rājagaha and 
joined the Order under Pajāpatī Gotamī. One day, in her old age, while 
meditating on the top of a peak, her insight expanded and she became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhartha Buddha, she belonged to a 
burgher’s family and offered her mekhalā at the Buddha’s cetiya (Thig.29, 30; 
ThigA.35f). She is evidently identical with Mekhaladāyikā of the Apadāna. 
Ap.ii.513.</p>
