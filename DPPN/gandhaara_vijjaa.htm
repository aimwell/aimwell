<h2>Gandhāra- or Gandhārī-vijjā</h2>
<p>A charm whereby one could become 
invisible and multiform, pass through all obstacles, through earth and water, 
and touch the sun and moon (D.i.213). Elsewhere (J.iv.498) the charm is 
mentioned as being only useful for the purpose of making oneself invisible.
</p>
<p>The Theragāthā Commentary (I.51f) 
distinguishes a Lesser and a Greater. Pilinda-vaccha knew the former and thought 
that the Buddha would teach him the other. The charm enabled him to travel 
through the air and read the thoughts of others.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (DA ii.389) explains that 
the charm was so called, either because it was invented by a sage named Gandhāra, 
or because it originated in Gandhāra.</p>
