<p>Once Senaka, king of Benares, saved a 
Nāga-king from being beaten to death by village lads, and the Nāga in gratitude 
gave the king many gifts, including a Nāga maiden to minister to him, and a 
charm by which he might trace her if ever she went out of his sight. One day the 
king went with her to the park, and there Senaka found her making love to a 
water-snake and struck her with a bamboo. She went to the Nāga-world and 
complained that she had been ill-treated. The Nāga-king sent four attendants to 
kill Senaka, but they, overhearing the king relating the story to his queen, 
reported the matter to the Nāga-king. The latter confessed his error to Senaka, 
and in order to make amends taught him a charm which gave him the knowledge of 
all sounds. Senaka was told that if he taught anyone else the charm he would 
perish in flames. Senaka’s queen discovered his possession of the charm, and did 
not cease to beg him to teach it to her, even though she knew that by so doing 
he would incur death. Unable to resist her, Senaka went with his queen to the 
park to teach her the charm and enter the flames. Sakka’s throne was heated, and 
transforming himself and his wife into goats they waited for the king, and on 
the approach of his chariot began to make love. The steeds in the chariot were 
shocked and upbraided the goats for their stupidity, but the goats replied that 
the steeds were stupid to let themselves be fastened to a chariot which carried 
so stupid a king as Senaka. The king, hearing their conversation, alighted from 
the chariot and, sending the queen on, asked of Sakka how he could evade his 
promise. Sakka suggested that the queen be told that she would receive one 
hundred lashes as part of her initiation. The queen agreed to this, but, when 
the flogging started, wished to change her mind, but the king, remembering her 
selfishness, caused the flogging to be carried out.</p>
<p>The story was related concerning a monk 
who was tempted by his former wife. Senaka was identified with the monk; 
Sāriputta was the chief steed and Sakka the Bodhisatta (J.iii.275ff).</p>
<p>One of the verses in the Jātaka occurs 
also in the Mahāsutasoma Jātaka. J.v.498.</p>
