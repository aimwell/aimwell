<p>Two suttas preached by the Buddha to 
Visākhā at the Migāramātupāsāda. </p>
<p>To achieve victory in this world a woman 
should have four qualities: she should efficiently discharge her duties as 
housewife, should win the esteem of her servants and the affection of her 
husband and should look after his wealth. For victory in the next world, she 
should be possessed of faith, virtue, generosity and wisdom. A.iv.269ff.</p>
