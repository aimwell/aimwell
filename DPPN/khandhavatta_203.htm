<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in 
<a href="kaasi.htm" title="ka/kaasi.htm">Kāsi</a>, 
and later became an ascetic. On it being reported to him that many ascetics died 
of snake-bite, he gathered them together and taught them how, by cultivating 
love for the four royal races of snakes — </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>the Virūpakkhas, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Erāpattas, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Chabbyāputtas, and </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Kanhagotamas — </li>
</ul>
<p>they could prevent themselves from ever 
being bitten by any creature. </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who died of snake-bite. J.ii.144ff.. cf. Vin.ii.109f. </p>
<p>The story is evidently an expansion of 
the <a href="khandha_paritta_v_sam.htm" title="ku/khandha_paritta_v_sam.htm">Khanda Paritta</a>.</p>
