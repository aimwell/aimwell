<p><b>1. Susīma.</b> The Bodhisatta in the time of 
<a href="atthadassii.htm" title="ay/atthadassii.htm">Atthadassī</a> 
Buddha. He was a Mahāsāla brahmin of <a href="campaka.htm" title="c/campaka.htm">Campaka</a> and became an ascetic of great 
power. He heard the Buddha preach at <a href="sudassana.htm" title="s/sudassana.htm">Sudassana</a> and was converted. J.i.39; 
Bu.xv.9f.; BuA.180.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Susīma.</b> The Bodhisatta, son of the chaplain of 
the king of Benares. He later became king himself. See the 
<a href="susiima_jat163_411.htm" title="s/susiima_jat163_411.htm">Susīma Jātaka</a> (No. 
411).</p>

<p><b>3. Susīma.</b> A king of Benares. See the 
<a href="susiima_jat163_411.htm" title="s/susiima_jat163_411.htm">Susīma Jātaka</a> 
(No, 163). He is identified with <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>. J.ii.50.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Susīma.</b> A Devaputta. Once, when Ānanda utters 
high praise of Sāriputta, Susīma, who is present, reflects on it and confirms 
all that Ānanda has said. The retinue of Susīma listen enraptured, waxing 
wondrous, in divers colour-tones (“even as a beautiful lustrous beryl-stone of 
eight facets, well polished, when laid in an orange coloured cloth, shines, 
glows and blazes, etc.”) (S.163f).</p>
<p>It is said (SA.i.98) that Susīma had been a fellow 
celibate of <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Susīma.</b> One of the thousand sons of 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>. He 
was one of the deva generals in the fight with the Asuras, but he was lazy, and 
Sakka had to admonish him (S.i.217; SA.i.262). He is probably identical with Susīma (4).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Susīma. </b>A <a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājaka</a> (skilled in the Vedangas, 
says Buddhaghosa, SA.ii.93) of Rājagaha. When the Buddha’s fame spread and his 
gains increased, Susīma’s followers suggested that he should learn the Buddha’s 
doctrine and preach it to the laity so that he and his followers, too, could 
reap some of the advantages.  </p>
<p>Susīma agreed, and sought, <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>, who, with the 
Buddha’s sanction, ordained him. In discussion with the monks who declared that 
they had obtained complete emancipation, etc., Susīma discovered that all of 
them did not possess supernatural powers, but thought they had gained nibbāna 
“through insight.” He thereupon sought the Buddha to have the matter explained. 
The Buddha asked him many questions, and made him realize the truth of their 
statement. Susīma confessed his original purpose in joining the Order and asked 
for forgiveness (S.ii.119ff). He developed insight and became an arahant. 
SA.ii.96.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Susīma. </b>A brahmin of 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> and son of 
<a href="sankha.htm" title="sa/sankha.htm">Sankha</a>. 
He went to Benares and apprenticed himself to a teacher, who was his father’s 
friend and who taught him various things. But he was able to understand only the 
beginning and the middle, and not the end. He therefore consulted his teacher, 
who confessed that neither did he understand the end, and advised him to seek 
the Pacceka Buddhas who were living in <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>. Susīma went there, entered the 
Order, and became a Pacceka Buddha. Soon afterwards he died, and Sankha, coming 
in search of his son, was told of what had happened. Sankha is identified with 
the Bodhisatta. DhA.iii.445f.; KhA.198f. </p>
