  <h2>Setaketu Jātaka (No. 377)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a far famed teacher, with five 
hundred pupils, chief among whom was Setaketu, an Udicca-brahmin, who prided 
himself on his high caste. One day, meeting a Candāla, Setaketu told him to pass 
on his leeward side, but the Candāla refused, challenging Setaketu to answer a 
question. Setaketu accepted the challenge, and he was asked what were the four 
“quarters.” Setaketu gave the usual answer, whereupon the Candāla forced him 
between his feet. When this was reported to the teacher, he told Setaketu that 
the four quarters were parents, teachers, generous householders, and deliverance 
from misery. Later, Setaketu left for Takkasilā, and, after finishing his 
studies there, went to Benares with five hundred ascetics. There they practised 
false penances and won the king’s approval; the king’s chaplain, however, warned 
him against them, saying that they possessed only false knowledge and had no 
morality. The chaplain persuaded Setaketu and his followers to become laymen and 
enter the king’s service.</p>
<p>The story was related in the same circumstances as the 
Uddāla Jātaka (q.v.). Setaketu is identified with the false priest, the Candāla 
with Sāriputta, and the king’s chaplain with the Bodhisatta. J.iii.232-7.</p>
