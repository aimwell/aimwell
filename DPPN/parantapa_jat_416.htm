<h2>Parantapa Jātaka (No. 416)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of the king of 
Benares. He came to understand the speech of animals, and thus learned from a 
she jackal whom he had offended that a hostile king with whom he would have to 
fight would march on to the city. His father bore him no love, and sent him to 
fight this king when he arrived. But all the citizens followed the prince, and 
his father, very alarmed, retired into the forest with his queen, his chaplain, 
and a servant, named <a href="parantapa.htm">Parantapa</a>, and lived in a hut. When the king and the 
chaplain went for fruit, the queen, though with child by the king, sinned with 
Parantapa and instigated him to kill the king while on his way to bathe in the 
river. The chaplain watched this deed but said nothing, and on his return 
feigned to have been suddenly blinded by a snake’s breath. The queen bore a son, 
and when he was sixteen, the chaplain told him of what had happened and taught 
him the use of a sword. Soon after, the boy killed Parantapa and returned with 
his mother and the chaplain to Benares, where the Bodhisatta made him his 
viceroy.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to <a href="devadatta.htm">Devadatta’s</a> attempts to 
kill the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with the old king. J.iii.415 21.</p>
