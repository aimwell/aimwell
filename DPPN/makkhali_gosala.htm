  <h2>Makkhali Gosāla</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the six heretical teachers contemporaneous with the 
Buddha. He held (*1) that there is no cause, either 
ultimate or remote, for the depravity of beings or for their rectitude. The 
attainment of any given condition or character does not depend either on one’s 
own acts, nor on the acts of another, nor on human effort. There is no such 
thing as power or energy or human strength or human vigour. All beings (sattā), 
all lives (pānā), all existent things (bhūtā), all living substances (jīvā), 
(*2) are bent this way and that by their fate, by the necessary conditions of 
the class to which they belong, by their individual nature; it is according to 
their position in one or other of the six classes (abhijāti) that they 
experience ease or pain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are fourteen hundred thousands of principle genera 
or species (pamukhayoniyo), again six thousand others and again six hundred. 
There are five hundred kinds of kamma — there are sixty two paths (or modes of 
conduct), sixty two periods, six classes among men, eight stages of a prophet’s 
existence (atthapurisabhūmi), (*3) forty nine hundred kinds of occupation, forty 
nine hundred Ājīvakas, forty nine hundred Wanderers (Paribbājaka), forty nine 
hundred Nāga abodes (or species), two thousand sentient existences (vīse 
indriyasate), three thousand infernal states, thirty six celestial, mundane or 
passionate grades (rajodhātuyo), seven classes of animate beings (saññigabbhā), 
or beings with the capacity of generating by means of separate sexes, seven of 
inanimate production (asaññigabbhā), seven of production by grafting (niganthagabbhā), 
seven grades of gods, men, devils, great lakes, precipices, dreams.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*1) D.i.53 f. Makkhali, his views and his followers are 
  also referred to at M.i.231, 238, 483, 516f.; S.i.66, 68; iii.211; iv.398; 
  A.i.33f., 286; iii.276, 384; also J.i.493, 509; S.iii.69 ascribes the first 
  portion of the account of Makkhali’s views (as given in D.i.53)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  that there is no cause, no reason for depravity or purity&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
  Pūrana Kassapa. A.i.286 apparently confounds Makkhali with Ajita Kesakambala, 
  and A.iii.383f. represents Pūrana Kassapa as though he were a disciple of 
  Makkhali.</p>
  <p>(*2) Buddhaghosa (DA.i.160 ff.) gives details of these 
  four classes showing how they are meant to include all that has life on this 
  earth, from men down to plants. But the explanation is very confused and makes 
  the terms by no means mutually exclusive.</p>
  <p>(*3) Buddhaghosa gives them as babyhood, playtime, trial 
  time, erect time, learning time, ascetic time, prophet time, and prostrate 
  time, with (very necessary) comments on each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are eighty four thousand periods during which both 
fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of 
pain. This cannot be done by virtue, or penance, or righteousness. Ease and 
pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of 
transmigration (samsāra); there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof&nbsp;&nbsp; 
both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, exactly for the allotted 
term, shall then, and then only, make an end of pain.</p>
<p>Makkhali’s views as given in the Buddhist books are 
difficult to understand, the Commentators themselves finding it a hopeless task. 
He seems to have believed in infinite gradations of existence; in his view, each 
individual thing has eternal existence, if not individually, at least in type. 
He evidently had definite conceptions of numerous grades of beings, celestial, 
infernal and mundane, as also of the infinity of time and the recurrent cycles 
of existence. He seems to have conceived the world as a system in which 
everything has a place and a function assigned to it, a system in which chance 
has no place and which admits of no other cause whatever, of the depravity or 
purity of beings, but that which is implied in the word Fate or Destiny (niyati). 
All types of things and all species of beings, however, are individually capable 
of transformation that is of elevation or degradation in type. His theory of 
purification through transmigration (samsārasuddhi) probably meant perfection 
through transformation (parinatā) — 
transformation which implies not only the process of constant change, but also a 
fixed orderly mode of progression and retrogression. All things must, in course 
of time, attain perfection (for a discussion on Makkhali and his doctrines see 
Barua: Pre buddhistic Indian Philosophy, 297ff). 
Makkhali’s followers are known as the Ājīvakas (q.v.).</p>
<p>According to the books, the Buddha considered Makkhali as 
the most dangerous of the heretical teachers: “I know not of any other single 
person fraught with such loss to many folk, such discomfort, such sorrow to 
devas and men, as Makkhali, the infatuate (A.i.33). The Buddha also considered 
his view the meanest — just as the hair blanket 
is reckoned the meanest of all woven garments, even so, of all the teachings of 
recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest (A.i.286). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166f) 
draws particular distinction between the moral effect of Makkhali’s doctrine on 
the one hand and that of the doctrines of Pūrana Kassapa and Ajita on the other. 
Pūrana, by his theory of the passivity of the soul, denied action; Ajita, by his 
annihilationistic theory denied retribution; whereas Makkhali, by his doctrine 
of fate or non causation, denied both action and its result.</p>
<p>Very little is known of the name and the life of Makkhali. 
The Buddhist records call him Makkhali Gosāla. Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.143f; 
MA.i.422) that he was once employed as a servant; one day, while carrying an 
oil-pot along a muddy road, he slipped and fell through carelessness, although 
warned thus by his master: “Mā khali,” (stumble not) — 
hence his name. When he found that the oil pot was broken, he fled; his master 
chased him and caught him by his garment, but he left it and ran along naked. He 
was; called Gosāla, because he was born in a cow shed. According to Jaina 
records (e.g. Uvāsaga-dasāo, p.1), he is called Gosāla Mankhaliputta; he was 
born at Saravana near Sāvatthi, his father’s name being Mankhali and his 
mother’s Bhaddā. His father was a Mankha&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e., a dealer in pictures
-&nbsp; and Gosāla followed this profession until he 
became a monk.</p>
<p>The philosopher’s true name (Barua, op. cit., 298) seems 
to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Pāli 
form Makkhali. “Maskarin” is explained by Pāninī (VI.i.154) as “one who carries 
a bamboo staff” (maskara). A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin. According to 
Patañjali (Mahābhāsya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were 
called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because 
they denied the freedom of the will. The Maskarins were thus fatalists or 
determinists.</p>
