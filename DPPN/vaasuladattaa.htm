<p>Wife of <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>, king of 
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. She was the daughter of Candappajjota. </p>
<p>When Pajjota heard that Udena’s splendour surpassed his 
own, he resolved to capture him. He was told that Udena could charm elephants 
with his magic lute, and had a wooden elephant made in which he placed sixty 
men. A woodsman was sent to inform Udena of the new elephant which had appeared 
in the forest, and he set out to capture it. The men inside the elephant caused 
it to run, and, in the course of the chase, Udena was separated from his retinue 
and taken captive.  </p>
<p>For three days Pajjota feasted in celebration of his victory, 
and Udena asked him either to release him or order his death. Pajjota promised 
release if Udena would teach him the elephant charm; but Udena would teach only 
to one who paid him homage as a teacher, and this Pajjota would not do. Then 
Pajjota contrived that Udena should teach it to Vāsuladattā. A curtain was hung 
between them, Udena was told that his pupil was a hunch backed woman of the 
court, while Udena was described to the princess as a leper who knew a priceless 
charm.  </p>
<p>For many days Udena tried to teach the charm, but the princess could not 
learn it. In impatience, Udena said: “Dunce of a hunchback, thy lips are too 
thick and thy cheeks too fat; I've a mind to beat thy face in.” And the princess 
replied: “Villain of a leper, what meanest thou by calling me hunchback?” Udena 
lifted the fringe of the curtain and they saw each other. From that moment they 
planned to escape and marry. There was no more learning of charms nor giving of 
lessons. When their plans were complete, Vāsuladattā told her father that she 
needed a conveyance and the use of a gate in the city wall. To work the charm, 
she explained, a certain herb was necessary, which must be obtained at night, at 
a time indicated by the stars. Thus she secured the use of Pajjota’s female 
elephant, Bhaddavatī, and permission to use a certain door at any time.  </p>
<p>And one 
day, when Pajjota was out on pleasure, the two filled several bags with gold and 
silver coins and they started off on Bhaddavatī. The harem guards gave the alarm 
and the king sent men in pursuit. Udena opened first a sack of gold and then one 
of silver, scattering the coins, which delayed his pursuers, greedy for the 
coins. He, meanwhile, hurried on and reached the stockade where his soldiers 
awaited him. They conducted him and Vāsuladattā, to Kosambī, where she was made 
Udena’s chief consort. DhA.i.191-6,198f.</p>
