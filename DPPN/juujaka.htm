<p>A brahmin of 
<a href="dunnivittha.htm" title="d/dunnivittha.htm">Dunnivittha</a> in <a href="kaalinga.htm" title="ka/kaalinga.htm">Kālinga</a>. He 
was given a young maiden in repayment of a debt, but because she was praised for 
her virtues, the other wives in the village grew jealous of her and mocked her 
as an old man’s darling. Thereafter she refused to go to the village well, and 
suggested that Jūjaka should obtain as slaves the children of 
<a href="vessantara.htm" title="vy/vessantara.htm">Vessantara</a>, then 
living as an ascetic in <a href="vankagiri.htm" title="va/vankagiri.htm">Vankagiri</a>.  </p>
<p>After many adventures Jūjaka found Vessantara, 
was allowed to have the two children, Jāli and Kanhajinā, and having tied their 
hands together, took them away. After he had travelled sixty leagues, the gods 
led him to Jetuttara, where the children’s grandfather reigned as king. The king 
bought the children back from Jūjaka at a very great price and gave him choice 
foods to eat. Jūjaka, having over-eaten and being unable to digest the food, 
died on the spot (J.vi.521-81). He is identified with 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> (J.vi.593).</p>
<p>The wife of the brahmin who went for 
alms to <a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a> was a descendant of Jūjaka. His descendants were still living in 
<a href="dunnivittha.htm" title="d/dunnivittha.htm">Dunnivittha</a>, even in the Buddha’s day (AA.i.183).</p>
