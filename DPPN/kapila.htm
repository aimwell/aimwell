<p><b>1. Kapila</b>.-Father of Pippali-mānava, who 
is better known as <a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā-Kassapa</a>. ThagA.ii.142; but see ThagA., p.73, verses 56, 
57.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="2">2</a>. Kapila</b>.-A brahmin, the Bodhisatta 
born as the chaplain of Upacara, king of Cetiya. The king had promised the post 
of chaplain to his friend Korakalamba, Kapila’s younger brother, and when 
reminded of his promise, undertook to recover it from Kapila’s son who had been 
given the appointment at Kapila’s request. The king, in spite of Kapila’s 
warning, attempted to fulfil his promise by lying, and, as a result, he was 
swallowed up in <a href="aviici.htm" title="ay/aviici.htm">Avīci</a>. The king’s five sons thereupon sought Kapila’s 
protection, and at his advice they left Ceti and founded five cities: 
<a href="h.htm#Hatthipura" title="h/h.htm#Hatthipura">Hatthipura</a>, 
<a href="assapura.htm" title="ay/assapura.htm">Assapura</a>, <a href="siihapura.htm" title="s/siihapura.htm">Sīhapura</a>, 
<a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a>, and 
<a href="daddara.htm" title="d/daddara.htm">Daddarapura</a> (J.iii.454ff).</p>
<p>Kapila is sometimes called Kapilatāpasa 
(J.v.273) and Kapila-isi (J.v.267). His encounter with the Cetiya king is 
evidently a famous legend, and is often referred to. E.g., in the 
<a href="sankicca_jat_530.htm" title="sa/sankicca_jat_530.htm">Sankicca 
Jātaka</a> (J.v.267).</p>

<p><b>3. Kapila</b>.-A brahmin, the Bodhisatta. 
When the sons of Okkāka went into voluntary exile and were looking for a spot on 
which to found a city, they came upon Kapila in his hermitage in Himavā by the 
side of a lake. He was versed in the science of Bhūmicāla, and was, therefore, 
acquainted with the qualities associated with various sites. He knew that any 
city built on the site of his hermitage would become the capital of Jambudīpa 
and that its inhabitants would be invincible. He therefore advised them to found 
a settlement there. They followed his advice and named the settlement 
Kapilavatthu after him (q.v.). A hermitage was built near it for the use of 
Kapila. DA.i.259f; MT.132f; SnA.ii.353; see also Mtu.i.348ff</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="4">4</a>. Kapila</b>.-A monk. He was the younger 
brother of Sodhana, his mother being Sādhinī and his sister Tāpanā. The whole 
family entered the Order of Kassapa Buddha; Sodhana learnt meditation and became 
an arahant. Kapila learnt the three Pitakas and, intoxicated with his learning, 
disagreed with everybody, right or wrong. He would heed no admonition, and 
followed a life of evil conduct in which he was followed by his mother and 
sister. One day, when Kapila was reciting the Pātimokkha, none of the other 
monks gave the responses, and in anger he declared that there was neither Dhamma 
nor Vinaya. Thus he put obstacles in the way of religion, and was reborn in 
Avīci.  </p>
<p>Later he was born in <a href="aciravatii.htm" title="am/aciravatii.htm">Aciravatī</a> as a fish, Kapilamaccha. Some fishermen, 
having caught him, took him to the king of Kosala. At the fish was of golden 
hue, the king took him to the Buddha, desiring an explanation of his colour. 
When the fish opened his mouth the whole of Jetavana stank. The Buddha 
questioned the fish and made him confess his sins. Struck with remorse, the fish 
died and was reborn once more in hell. DhA.iv.37ff; SnA.ii.305f; SA.ii.152; see 
also UdA.179f; ThagA.i.356.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Kapila</b>.-A sinful monk who lived in a 
village near Kosambī. He was the friend of Pandaka (q.v.). Vin.iii.67.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="6">6</a>. Kapila</b>.-The Majjhima Commentary 
(i.75) has a reference to a monk named Kapila, who, because of his greed for 
possessions, is described as having been reborn with a flaming sanghāti-robe (sanghātī 
pi ādittā hoti). This probably refers to a monk mentioned in the Pārājikā 
(Vin.iii.107), who was reborn as a peta and who could be seen going through the 
air with his robe aflame.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Kapila</b>.-A city, called Kapilanagara, 
capital of Pañcālarattha. This city once had Cūlani-Brahmadatta as its king 
(PvA.161; Netti.142). Perhaps it is this city that is mentioned in the Dīpavamsa 
(iii.17; MT.127) as having been the capital of Abhītatta (v.l. Ajitajina) and 
his eighty-four thousand descendants.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="8">8</a>. Kapila</b>.-A brahmin of Sāgala, in the 
Madda Country, father of Bhaddā-kapilānī. Kapila’s wife was Sucīmatī (ThagA.73; 
Ap.ii.583). The word Kapilāni is probably derived from his name.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Kapila</b>.-A great physician, mentioned 
in a list of eminent physicians of old. Mil.272.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Kapila</b>.-A minister of King Vohārika-Tissa. 
He was appointed by the king to suppress the Vetulya doctrine and hold the 
heretics in check. Mhv.xxxvi.41; Dpv.xxii.44.</p>
<hr>

<p><b>11. Kapila</b>.-An ancient teacher of 
philosophy, mentioned together with Kanāda as having taught that the soul was 
limitless (na antavā) (UdA.339; see also Svetasvatara Upanisad v.2, and Rāmāyana 
i.40). He is probably identical with the founder of the Sānkhya system.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Kapila</b>.-An ancient seer, probably of 
Ceylon, in whose honour Parakkamabāhu I. built the Kapila-vihāra near 
Pulatthipura, with many-storied buildings, frescoes, and other ornamentations.
