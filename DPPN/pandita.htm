<h4>2. Pandita</h4>
<p>One of the four novices invited by the brahmin whose house 
came later to be known as the <a href="pancachiddageha.htm" title="pa/pancachiddageha.htm">Pañcachiddageha</a> (DhA.iv.176ff). In the time 
of Kassapa Buddha he was known as <a href="mahaduggata.htm" title="maha/mahaduggata.htm">Mahāduggata</a>. In his last birth his 
mother was the daughter of a rich merchant of Sāvatthi. During her pregnancy, 
she had a longing to give to five hundred monks, headed by Sāriputta, the 
choicest portions of red fish, to don yellow robes, to sit in the outer circle 
of the monks' seats, and to partake of the food left over by the monks. This 
longing was satisfied, and seven times she held similar festivities. When the 
child was born he was called Pandita because, from the day of his conception, 
various people of the household who had been stupid or deaf or dumb recovered 
their faculties. When seven years old, he was filled with the desire to become a 
monk, and was ordained by Sāriputta, a constant visitor to the house. For seven 
days his parents held a festival in honour of his ordination. On the eighth day 
he went, with Sāriputta, into the village for alms; on the way, certain things 
which he saw&nbsp;-&nbsp; a ditch, arrow makers, carpenters — made him wish to 
strive for arahantship. Thereupon, with the leave of Sāriputta, he returned to 
the monastery requesting the Elder to bring him some red fish on his return from 
the alms round. In the monastery, Sakka stilled all noises and held back the sun 
and the moon, lest Pandita should be disturbed. The Buddha, seeing this, 
detained Sāriputta back on his way to the monastery, and engaged him in 
conversation until Pandita should have succeeded in his effort. After a while, 
Pandita became an arahant and the whole world rejoiced. Ibid., ii.139ff.</p>
