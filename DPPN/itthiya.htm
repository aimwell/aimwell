<p>One of the monks who accompanied Mahinda 
on his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xii.7; Dpv.xii.12; Sp.i.71; Mbv.116; DhsA.32).
</p>
<p>King Sirimeghavanna had an image of 
Itthiya made and placed beside that of Mahinda and his companions in the vihāra 
which he built in the south-eastern corner of his palace. He inaugurated a 
year’s festival in honour of these images (Cv.xxxvii.vv.87ff) (v.l. Ittiya, 
Iddhiya).</p>
