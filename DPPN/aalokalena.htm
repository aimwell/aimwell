<p>A cave in the cleft of a mighty primeval 
landslide, not far from the modern Matale in Ceylon. According to tradition it 
was here that the Buddhist scriptures were first reduced to writing in Ceylon 
under the patronage of a chieftain of King Vattagāmani. The Burmese believe that 
Buddhaghosa’s Atthakathās were also written in this spot (Mhv.xxiii.100f. See 
PLC.43f). In the eighteenth century King Vijayarājasīha built images of the 
Buddha in the rock cave. Cv.xcviii.65.</p>
