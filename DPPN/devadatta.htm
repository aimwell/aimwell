  <h2>Devadatta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Son of the Sākiyan Suppabuddha (maternal 
uncle of the Buddha) and his wife Amitā. He had a sister Bhaddakaccānā, who 
married Prince Siddhattha. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mhv.ii.22; MT.136; DhA.iii.44. The 
  Dulva (Rockhill, p.13) calls him the son of Amitodana and brother of Ānanda. 
  This is supported by Mtu. (ii.69), which says that after the Buddha’s 
  renunciation, Devadatta tried to tempt Bhaddakaccānā. In one passage in the 
  Vinaya (ii.189), Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta. Does this mean that his 
  mother’s name was Godhī? The Sanskrit books (e.g., Mtu) give several stories 
  of his youth which show his malice. When Siddhattha was about to show his 
  skill in the arts, a white elephant was being brought for him, and Devadatta, 
  out of envy, killed it. The carcase blocked the city gates till Siddhattha 
  threw it outside. The Pāli Commentaries (e.g., SA.i.62) say that Devadatta had 
  the strength of five elephants. On another occasion he quarrelled with 
  Siddhattha, who protested against his shooting a goose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu 
after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted 
together with his friends Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their 
barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiyā and entered the Order 
(Vin.ii.182). During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the 
power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world (puthujja-nika-iddhi) 
(Vin.ii.183; for particulars see Rockhill, p.85). For some time he seems to have 
enjoyed great honour in the Order, and in one passage he is mentioned in a list 
of eleven of the chief Elders of all of whom the Buddha speaks in praise. 
(Ud.i.5. Again in Vin.ii.189 Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about 
Rājagaha singing Devadatta’s praises; see also DhA.i.64f). Devadatta was later 
suspected of evil wishes (E.g., S.ii.156). About eight years before the Buddha’s 
death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha’s fame, 
attempted to win over Ajātasattu. </p>
<p>The following account is summarised from 
various passages in the books, chiefly Vin.ii.184ff; iii.171f; 174f; iv.71; 
DhA.i.112ff; iii.154; A.iii.123, 402; ii.73; iv.160; J.i.113, 142, 185, 490; 
iv.37, 158; v.333ff; vi.129f., etc.</p>
<p>He assumed the form of a child having a 
girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu’s lap, frightening him. He 
then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour 
and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and 
sent him daily five hundred dishes of food. (According to J.i.186, 508, 
Ajātasattu built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and sent him, daily, five 
hundred pots of three-year-flavoured rice and the choicest dishes. These meals 
were so tempting that some of the Buddha’s followers would go there to eat them 
and return stealthily). </p>
<p>This encouraged Devadatta in his 
schemes, and he conceived the idea of taking the Buddha’s place as leader of the 
Sangha. As soon as this thought occurred to him, his iddhi-power disappeared.</p>
<p>The Koliyan Kakudha, follower of 
Moggallāna, reborn as a manomaya-kāyikadeva, divined Devadatta’s plan and 
informed Moggallāna. The latter repeated the matter to the Buddha, but the 
Buddha said it was unnecessary to discuss it as Devadatta would ultimately 
betray himself.</p>
<p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the 
Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to 
him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the 
suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the 
Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” 
(Vin.ii.188. This incident is referred to in the Abhayarājakumāra Sutta, 
M.i.393). Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at 
the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Sangha that in 
anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, 
none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Devadatta 
incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to 
kill the Buddha. (The Ap.ii.300f explains that all these plans of Devadatta to 
harm the Buddha were the result of the Buddha’s previous evil deeds).</p>
<p>Ajātasattu agreed, and provided 
Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different 
paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan 
was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the 
Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and 
his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing 
away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to 
him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other 
groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after 
the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and 
he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta 
saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.</p>
<p>Devadatta then decided to kill the 
Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūta, 
he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby 
arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing 
the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from 
there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the 
monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was 
impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.</p>
<p>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s 
life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri 
(or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. 
The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As 
the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.</p>
<p>This outrage made Devadatta very 
unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to 
withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. 
(Sp.iv.811. At this time, Kokālika was very useful to Devadatta, J. ii.438). 
Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, 
Katamoraka-tissa, Khandadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in 
the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the 
imposition of five rules on all members of the Sangha: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(1) that monks should dwell all their 
  lives in the forest, </li>
  <li>
  <p>(2) that they should accept no 
  invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(3) that they should wear only robes 
  made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, </li>
  <li>
  <p>(4) that they should dwell at the foot 
  of a tree and not under a roof, </li>
  <li>
  <p>(5) that they should abstain 
  completely from fish and flesh. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha’s reply was that those who 
felt so inclined could follow these rules — except that of sleeping under a tree 
during the rainy season — but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This 
refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the 
Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in 
spite of the Buddha’s warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the 
Order, Devadatta informed Ānanda  of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting 
without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from 
Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa. On this occasion he tried to 
imitate the Buddha, keeping two chief disciples beside him (DhA.i.122). Three 
suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.</p>
<p>Among the followers of Devadatta were 
also some nuns, chief of whom was Thullanandā, who never tired of singing his 
praises (Vin.iv.66, 335). The mother of Kumārakassapa (q.v.), also, first 
entered the Order under Devadatta, but when he denounced her, following the 
discovery of her pregnancy, she sought refuge with the Buddha. Some of the 
Sākiyans, too, seem to have preferred Devadatta to the Buddha — e.g., Dandapāni 
(MA.i.298). </p>
<p>The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna 
to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had 
come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika’s warning, welcomed them. 
That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked 
Sāriputta to address the assembly. Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such 
effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokālika 
kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When 
Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for 
nine months he lay grievously ill. (The Vinaya account omits the kicking, but it 
is mentioned in DhA.i.143 and in J.i.491). </p>
<p>As his end drew near, he wished to see 
the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this 
life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching 
Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to 
wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci, where, after suffering 
for one hundred thousand kappas, he would be reborn as a Pacceka Buddha called 
Atthissara. (The Saddharmapundarika (chap.xi.) says he will be a Buddha named 
Devarāja). It is said (DhA.i.147; see also Mil.108) that at the moment of being 
swallowed by the earth, Devadatta uttered a stanza in which he declared that he 
had no refuge other than the Buddha. It is this last act of Devadatta’s which 
the Buddha had in view when he agreed to ordain Devadatta. (He was one of five 
people who were swallowed by the earth in the Buddha’s time. Mil.101). 
</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary contains a 
graphic account of the tortures of Devadatta in Avīci. (DhA.i.147; also PSA.79. 
His body in bell is one hundred leagues long). In previous births, also, he had 
been swallowed by the earth, as King Kalābu and as Mahāpatāpa. When the people 
heard of Devadatta’s death, they held a great festival, as they had done of yore 
at the death of Pingala, who was an incarnation of Devadatta (DhA.i.126f).</p>
<p>The Jātaka Commentary contains numerous 
stories showing that Devadatta’s enmity towards the Buddha was not confined to 
this life. It had existed during many kappas, and though sometimes he was foiled 
in his attempts to harm the Bodhisatta, in many cases he succeeded in working 
his will. The beginning of this enmity, which increased with time, is described 
in the <a href="serivanija_jat_003.htm" title="s/serivanija_jat_003.htm">Serivānija Jātaka</a>.</p>
<p>One of the Milinda dilemmas (200ff) is 
as follows: “Why should Devadatta, who was so wicked, have been, time after 
time, superior in power to the Bodhisatta?” A list of such instances is given. 
Nāgasena’s reply is that Devadatta did several good deeds, such as protecting 
the poor, building bridges, etc.</p>
<p>Devadatta’s wickedness and his hatred of 
the Bodhisatta are illustrated in various Jātakas besides those already 
mentioned — e.g., </p>

<p>In the <a href="dhamma_jat_457.htm" title="d/dhamma_jat_457.htm">Dhamma Jātaka</a>, Devadatta is 
spoken of as having been the very incarnation of unrighteousness, Adhamma. In 
several stories his craftiness is emphasised — e.g., </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>as the jackal in the 
  <a href="sigala_jat_113_142_8.htm" title="s/sigala_jat_113_142_8.htm">Sigālā Jātaka</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>as the drunken sot in the Sigāla 
  (No.2) and also in the Manoja. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the Kālabāhu Jātaka he is represented 
as very envious, and his falsehood and duplicity are emphasised in </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>the Cetiya, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Kakkāra and </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Somanassa Jātakas. </li>
</ul>
<p>His ingratitude is illustrated in such 
stories as those of </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>the Anta, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Amba, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Asampadāna, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Upāhana, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Guttila, </li>

  <p>the Javasakuna, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Dūbhiya-makkata, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Nigrodha, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Mahākapi, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Ruru and </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Sīlavanāga Jātakas,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;while others, such as </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>the Apannaka, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Ubhatobhattha, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Kandagalaka, </li>

  <p>the Sabbadātha, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Sammuddavānija, </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Sammodamāna Jātakas, speak of his 
  folly and inefficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is stated (E.g., Mil.410) that in 
spite of the great hatred shown by Devadatta towards him, the Buddha did not 
harbour, on his part, one single feeling of ill-will.</p>
<p>Only once is mention made (A.iv.402f ) 
of the text of a sermon by Devadatta. Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, 
who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.</p>
