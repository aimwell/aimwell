<p>A candāla maiden of Uttara Madhurā. She 
was very beautiful, and was so called because she had a golden mole between her 
breasts. When the king heard that she wanted to marry a man of high lineage he 
challenged her to win Uddāla of Pañcamadhurā who hated women. She accepted the 
challenge and went with her father. On the way seven kings offered to marry her, 
but she refused them. Uddāla fell in love with her at sight and lived with her 
for four months, neglecting all his duties. His pupils were enraged and killed 
Suvannatilakā. He thereupon jumped into her pyre.</p>
<p>In her last life Suvannatilakā had been 
born in Anurādhapura. One day she went with her mother to Abhayuttaracetiya, 
and, when her mother went to fetch water to wash the altar, Suvannatilakā 
offered the flowers without waiting. The mother was angry and called her “candālī.” 
Suvannatilakā retorted, saying, “You are the candālī, not I.” This was why she 
became a candālī. Ras.i.74f.</p>
