<p>King of Dantapura in Kālinga. </p>
<p>Once, a holy ascetic came with five hundred others and 
took up his abode in the royal park. Nālikira visited the ascetic and was 
displeased with the questions he was asked as to whether he ruled his people 
righteously. He therefore invited the ascetics to his palace, filled their bowls 
with filth, and had them beaten and attacked by dogs. The earth opened and 
swallowed the king. He was born in the Sunakha niraya, where he had to undergo 
various kinds of tortures. His kingdom was destroyed and became a waste 
(J.v.119, 143, 144f.; MA.ii.602ff.; Mtu.iii.361, 368, 369). The story was 
evidently widely current in India.</p>
