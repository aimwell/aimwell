<p>In the past, when the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were 
already forgotten, there ruled a king named Usīnara. Monks and nuns lived in 
wickedness, and men followed evil paths, being born, after death, in the Niraya. 
Sakka, finding no one entering the deva worlds from among men, decided to scare 
the men into virtue. Assuming the guise of a forester and leading Mātali 
disguised as a black fierce looking dog called Mahākanha, Sakka came to the city 
gates and cried aloud that the world was doomed to destruction. The people fled 
in terror into the city and the gates were shut. But the forester leapt over the 
city wall with his dog, the latter scaring everyone he saw. The king shut 
himself up in his palace, but the dog put his forefeet on the palace window and 
set up a roar, which was heard from the hells to the highest heavens. The 
forester said the dog was hungry, and the king ordered food to be given him. But 
he ate it all in one mouthful and roared for more. Usīnara then asked the 
forester what kind of dog it was, and was told that the animal ate up all those 
who walked in unrighteousness, and described who the unrighteous were. Then 
having terrified everyone, Sakka revealed himself and returned to his heaven. 
The king and his people became virtuous, and Kassapa’s religion lasted for one 
thousand years more.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a conversation among 
the monks to the effect that the Buddha was always working for the good of 
others, never resting, never tiring, his compassion extended towards all beings. 
Mātali is identified with Ānanda (J.iv.180 6).</p>
<p>The barking of Mahākanha was among the four sounds heard 
throughout Jambudīpa. SNA.i.223; see J.iv.182, where only three are mentioned.</p>
