<p>An arahant. Ninety-one kappas ago she 
was the wife of King Bandhumā, of Bandhumatī. Wishing to do some good deed to 
ensure for herself a happy rebirth, she asked the king for his sanction, and fed 
a nun and gave her various gifts. Later she was born thirty times in Tāvatimsa 
as queen of the gods. She was the wife of twenty kings among men (Ap.ii.515f).
</p>
<p>She is probably identical with Mettā 
Therī (ThigA.36f).</p>
