<p>One of the sixteen Mahājanapadas which, 
with Gandhāra, belonged, not to the Majjhimadesa but, evidently, to the 
Uttarāpatha (A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260). It is often mentioned as the famous 
birthplace of horses (assānam āyatanam) (E.g., DA.i.124; AA.i.399; Vsm.332; also 
J.iv.464). In the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.445) we are told that the Kambojas caught 
their horses by means of moss (jalajāta), and the scholiast (J.v.446) explains 
at length how this was done. They sprinkled the moss with honey and left it in 
the horses' drinking place; from there, by means of honey sprinkled on the 
grass, the horses were led to an enclosure.</p>
<p>In the Assalāyana Sutta (M.ii.149) it is 
stated that in Yona and in Kamboja, and also in the neighbouring countries, 
there were, in the Buddha’s time, only two classes of people, masters and 
slaves, and that a master could become a slave or vice versa. The Commentary 
(MA.ii.784) explains that a brahmin would go there with his wife for purposes of 
trade and would die there. His wife would then be compelled to work for her 
living and her children would become slaves.</p>
<p>The Jātakas (E.g., J.vi.208, 210; see 
also Manu.x.44) would lead us to believe that the people of Kamboja had lost 
their original customs and had become barbarous. Elsewhere' Kamboja is mentioned 
as a place not visited by women of other countries. A.ii.82; on the reading of 
this passage, however, see GS.ii.92, n.2. The Commentary (AA.ii.523) distinctly 
supports the reading Kamboja.</p>
<p>The country was evidently on one of the 
great caravan routes, and there was a road direct from Dvāraka to Kamboja 
(Pv.p.23).</p>
<p>According to Asoka’s Rock Edict, No. 
XIII. (Shābhāzgarhi Text), Kamboja was among the countries visited by Asoka’s 
missionaries. The country referred to is probably on the banks of the Kabul 
river (Mookerji: Asoka, 168, n.1).</p>
<p>In later literature (E.g., Cv.lxxvi.21, 
55) Kamboja is the name given to Western Siam. </p>
