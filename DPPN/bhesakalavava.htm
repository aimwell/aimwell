<p>A grove in the <a href="bhagga.htm" title="b/bhagga.htm">Bhagga</a> country. It contained a Deer Park 
wherein the  <span lang="en-us"><a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> </span>stayed, on
<a href="sumsumaaragiri.htm" title="s/sumsumaaragiri.htm">Sumsumāragiri</a>. Near by was the house in which 
lived <a href="nakulapita.htm" title="n/nakulapita.htm">Nakulapitā</a> and Nakhulamātā (A.ii.61; iii.295; S.iii.1; iv.116).  </p>
<p>Once, when 
the Buddha was at Bhesakalāvana, he saw, with his divine eye, 
<a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> dwelling 
in the <a href="pacinavamsamigadaya.htm" title="pa/pacinavamsamigadaya.htm">Pācīnavamsadāya</a> in the Ceti country, and appeared before him to encourage 
him in his meditations (A.iv.228ff.; J.iii.157).  </p>
<p>The palace <a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanada</a>, built for 
Prince <a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhi</a>, was in the neighbourhood of the grove (Vin.ii.127; DhA.iii.134, 
etc.).</p>
<p>It was while staying in this grove that 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Mahā Moggallāna</a> 
was molested by <a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> and he preached the
<a href="maaratajjaniiya_s.htm" title="ma/maaratajjaniiya_s.htm">Māratajjaniya Sutta</a> (M.i.332). </p>
<p>Singālapitā is said to have retired to Bhesakalāvana for his meditations 
(ThagA.i.70).</p>
<p>The grove received its name from the fact that its 
presiding spirit was a Yakkhinī called Bhesākalā (SA.ii.181).</p>
<p>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.3), the 
Buddha spent the eight vassa at Bhesakalāvana.  </p>
<p>The Divyāvadāna calls it 
Bhīsanikāvana. Dvy.182.</p>
