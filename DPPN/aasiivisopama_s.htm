<p>Probably refers to Āsīvisa Sutta (1), 
but may be (2). </p>

to the Nāga-king Aravāla and the people of Kasmīra and Gandhāra. </p>
<p>Eighty thousand of the listeners 
accepted the new religion and one hundred thousand were ordained after the 
sermon (Sp.i.66; Mhv.xii.26). </p>
<p>It was also preached by Mahinda in 
Ceylon in the Nandanavana at Anurādhapura on the third day after his entry into 
the city. Thirty thousand people were converted. Ibid., xv.178-9; Sp.i.80; 
Mbv.133.</p>
