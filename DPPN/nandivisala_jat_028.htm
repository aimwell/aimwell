  <h2>Nandivisāla Jataka (No. 28)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as a bull in Gandhāra and was 
named Nandivisāla. When quite young, he was given to a Brahmin, who fed him on 
delicacies and looked after him. When Nandi grew up, in order to show his 
gratitude to the Brahmin, he suggested that he should draw one hundred carts for 
a wager. The Brahmin boasted to his friends and had a wager with them. On the 
appointed day he loaded one hundred carts, lashed them together, and having tied 
Nandivisala to the first, took his seat on the pole and, flourishing his goad, 
shouted, “Now, you rascal, pull.” The bull, very offended, would not stir, and 
the Brahmin lost his money. As he lay groaning in bed, Nandivisala went to him 
and said that he should not have abused him. He then asked him to wager two 
thousand, and said that this time he would win. This the Brahmin did, and the 
next day, having tied one hundred carts together, he yoked Nandivisala to the 
frat and stroked his back saying, “Now then, my fine fellow, pull.” With one 
heave, Nandivisala pulled the carts, and the last stood where the first had 
been. Nandivisala’s master received many presents in addition to the wager.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the taunts uttered 
by the Chabbaggiyas against the virtuous monks.</p>
<p>Ānanda was the brahmin of the story (J.i.191ff.; the story 
is also given at Vin.iv.5). It was also related in connection with the 
Yamakapātihāriya. DhA.iii.213.</p>
