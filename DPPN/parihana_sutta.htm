<h4>1. Parihāna Sutta</h4>
<p>Sāriputta tells the monks of the qualities which lead to 
their deterioration&nbsp;&nbsp; not listening to the Dhamma, not having clear 
ideas about it, not practising it, and not obtaining fresh knowledge thereof. He 
who wishes to progress should train himself to know both his own mind and the 
minds of others; he should practise introspection. A.v.102 ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Parihāna Sutta</h4>
<p>On eight conditions which lead to the degeneration of a 
learner, and their opposites. A.iv.331f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Parihāna Sutta</h4>
<p>On the six stations of mastery (cha abhibhāyatanāni) which 
prevent a monk from falling away. Seeing an object with the eye, he does not 
allow evil and unprofitable states to arise in his mind, memories and hopes akin 
to fetters that bind. Likewise with the other senses. S.iv.76f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Parihāna Sutta</h4>
<p>A conversation between Ānanda and Bhadda at the 
Kukkutārāma in Pātaliputta, regarding decay and non decay. 
S.v.173.</p>
