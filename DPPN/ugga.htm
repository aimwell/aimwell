<p><b>1. Ugga.</b>-A banker in the time of Konāgamana Buddha; he was one of the Buddha’s chief lay-supporters and built for 
him a residence, half a league in extent, on the site of the later Jetavana. 
J.i.94; Bu.xxiv.24.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ugga.</b>-The chief minister of Pasenadi, 
king of Kosala (AA.ii.697). He once visited the Buddha and told him how he 
rivalled in power and wealth the setthi Migāra, grandson of Rohana. He was worth 
one hundred thousand in gold alone, to say nothing of silver. The Buddha tells 
him that all this wealth could easily be lost in various ways, not so the seven 
kinds of Ariyan wealth (saddhā, sīla, etc.). A.iv.6-7.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ugga.</b>-One of those that formed the 
retinue of the rājā Eleyya. He was a follower of Uddaka-Rāmaputta, whom the king 
too held in veneration. A.ii.180.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="4">4</a>. Ugga (-Gahapati).-</b>A householder of 
<a href="hatthigama.htm" title="h/hatthigama.htm">Hatthigāma(ka)</a> 
of the Vajji country. Among householders he was declared by the Buddha to be the 
best of those who waited on the Order (sanghupatthākānam) (A.i.26). On his 
father’s death he was appointed to the post of setthi. Once when the Buddha went 
to Hatthigāma during a tour and was staying in the Nāgavanuyyāna there, Ugga 
came to the pleasance, with dancers, at the conclusion of a drinking-feast of 
seven days' duration. At the sight of the Buddha he was seized with great shame 
and his intoxication vanished. The Buddha preached to him and he became an 
anāgāmī. Thereupon he dismissed his dancers and devoted himself to looking after 
members of the Sangha. Devas visited him at night and told him of the 
attainments of various monks, suggesting that he should choose only the eminent 
ones as the recipients of his gifts. But what he gave, he gave to all with equal 
delight (AA.i.214-5).</p>
<p>The Buddha once stated that Ugga was 
possessed of eight special and wonderful qualities. One of the monks, hearing 
the Buddha’s statement, went to Ugga and asked him what these qualities were. 
Ugga replied that he was not aware of what the Buddha had in mind and proceeded 
to explain eight wonderful things that had happened to him, viz.:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) As soon as 
he saw the Buddha, his state of drunkenness vanished and he made obeisance to 
the Buddha, who talked to him on various topics, such as dāna, sīla, etc. </li>
  <li>(2) 
When the Buddha saw that Ugga’s mind was ready, he preached to him the Four 
Truths, which he understood and realised. </li>
  <li>(3) He had had four young and 
beautiful wives; when he took the vow of celibacy, he made ample provision for 
them; for one of them he obtained the husband of her choice, because she so 
desired, and this he did with no tinge of jealousy. </li>
  <li>(4) All his immense wealth 
he shared with men of good and lovely conduct. </li>
  <li>(5) On whatever monk he waited, 
he did it with whole-heartedness; to the monk’s preaching he listened earnestly; 
if the monk did not preach, Ugga himself taught him the doctrine. </li>
  <li>(6) Devas told him of the different attainments of various monks, but he 
  gave to all alike, without distinction. </li>
  <li>(7) He felt no pride that he should hold converse with devas. </li>
  <li>(8) He did not worry about death because the Buddha had assured him that 
  he would never more return to this world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The monk reports this conversation to 
the Buddha and the Buddha tells him that these were the very qualities he had in 
mind when praising Ugga (A.iv.212-6).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (Vajjī Sutta<b>, </b>S.iv.109f) records 
a visit paid to the Buddha by Ugga, at Hatthigāmaka. He asked the Buddha why it 
was that some beings attained full freedom in this very life, while others did 
not. Because of grasping, says the Buddha.</p>
<p>Ugga had been a householder in the time 
of Padumuttara Buddha. He once heard the Buddha preach and declare, at the end 
of his sermon, one of his lay disciples to be the best of those who waited on 
the Order. He wished for himself a similar attainment and did many good deeds 
towards that end (AA.i.214). v.l. Uggata.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Ugga.</b>-A householder of Vesāli, 
declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who gave agreeable gifts (manāpadāyakānam). 
(A.i.26; in SA.iii.26 he is wrongly described as aggo panītadāyakānam — the 
title of Mahānāma).</p>
<p>His original name is not known. He came 
to be called Ugga-setthi, because he was tall in body, lofty in morals and of 
striking personality. The very first time he saw the Buddha, he became a 
sotāpanna and later an anāgāmī. When he was old, the thought came to him one 
day, while he was alone, “I will give to the Buddha whatever I consider most 
attractive to myself and I have heard from him that such a giver obtains his 
wishes. I wish the Buddha would come to my house now.” The Buddha, reading his 
thoughts, appeared before his door with a following of monks. He received them 
with great respect and, having given them a meal, announced to the Buddha his 
intention of providing him and the monks with whatever they found agreeable 
(AA.i.213-4).</p>
<p>While staying at the Kūtāgārasālā in 
Vesāli, the Buddha once declared to the monks that Ugga was possessed of eight 
marvellous qualities. The rest of the story is very similar to that of Ugga of 
Hatthigāmaka, given above. This Ugga states as the first wonderful thing which 
happened to him, the faith he found in the Buddha at their very first meeting; 
three and four are the same; the fifth is that whatever monk he waits on, he 
does it whole-heartedly; the sixth, that if the monk preaches he would listen 
with attention, if the monk does not preach, Ugga would teach to him the 
doctrine; the seventh is the same; the eighth that he has got rid of all the 
orambhāgiya-samyojanas mentioned by the Buddha. The conversation is reported to 
the Buddha who agrees that Ugga does possess the qualities mentioned 
(A.iv.208-12).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.109f) repeats 
under Ugga of Vesāli the same discussion with the Buddha as was given in 
connection with Ugga of Hatthigāma, regarding the reason why some beings do not 
attain complete freedom in this very life. This is perhaps due to uncertainty on 
the part of the compilers as to which Ugga took part in the original discussion.</p>
<p>A sutta in the Anguttara Nikāya 
(A.iii.49-51) gives a list of things of which Ugga himself was fond. We are told 
that he offered these things to the Buddha. The list includes rice-cakes made in 
the shape of Sāla-blossoms, the flesh of sucking pig and Kāsi robes. These and 
other things were given not only to the Buddha, but, according to the Commentary 
(AA.ii.602), also to five hundred monks. The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died 
soon after and was born among the Manomayadevā. He visited the Buddha from the 
deva-world and stated that he had achieved his goal (of reaching arahantship).</p>
<p>He is included in a list of householders 
who possessed six special qualities: unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the 
Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan conduct, insight and liberation (A.iv.451).</p>
<p>His desire to become chief of those who 
give agreeable things was first conceived in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, 
when he was a householder in Hamsavatī; he heard the Buddha describe one of his 
disciples as being a giver of such gifts (AA.i.213).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Ugga.</b>-A thera. He was the son of a 
banker in Ugga, in the Kosala country. When the Buddha was staying in the 
Bhaddārāma there, Ugga heard him preach and entered the Order. Soon afterwards 
he became an arahant (Thag.v.80; ThagA.i.174-5).</p>
<p>He had been a householder in the time of 
Sikhī Buddha and offered him a ketaka-flower. As a result, he was born twelve 
times as king. He is probably to be identified with Sudassana Thera of the 
Apadāna (i.164-5).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Ugga. </b>A banker of the city of Ugga; 
he was a friend of Anāthapindika and, according to some accounts, his son 
married Anāthapindika’s daughter, Cūla Subhaddā. He and his family had been 
followers of the Niganthas, but they later became followers of the Buddha 
through the intervention of Subhaddā. For the story see Cūla Subhaddā. See also 
Kālaka (1).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Ugga.</b>-A township (nigama) in Koala. 
The Buddha stayed there at the Bhaddārāma (ThagA.i.74). The town was the 
residence of the banker Ugga, and was once a stronghold of the Niganthas; after 
the conversion of Ugga’s family, through Cūla Subhaddā’s intervention, the 
people became faithful followers of the Buddha and for some time Anuruddha lived 
there, at the Buddha’s special bidding, to preach to the new converts (DhA.iii.465-9; according to 
ThagA.i.65 Mahā Subhaddā also lived in Ugga, in a family of unbelievers). 
Probably the Uggārāma, mentioned in the story of Anganika Bhāradvāja 
(ThagA.i.339; Brethren, 157, n.4), was also in Ugga, in which case it was near 
the village of Kundiya of the Kuru country.</p>
