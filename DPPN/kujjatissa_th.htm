<p>An arahant. He lived in Mangana in 
Ceylon, and was mentioned by the Sangha to King Saddhātissa as being worthy of 
his special worship. The king travelled five leagues to see him, but the thera, 
lest the king should invite him to the palace, lay down on a bed at the time of 
the king’s arrival and started scratching letters on the floor. The king decided 
that the thera was not an arahant and went away. When he was blamed for having 
displeased so pious a king, the thera undertook to make amends. He requested 
that, after his death, he should be placed in a covered palanquin containing 
also a second bed. This was done and the palanquin travelled by air to 
Anurādhapura, performing many miracles, applauded by the people. In Anurādhapura 
it circled round the Thūpārāma and the Silācetiya and, when it reached the 
Lohapāsāda, the thera Mahāvyaggha entered the palanquin, lay down on the spare 
bed and entered Nibbāna. The king made offerings of flowers and perfumes to the 
palanquin and it descended to earth, for such had been Kujjatissa’s desire. The 
bodies were burnt and thūpas were erected over the relics. AA.i.384f.
