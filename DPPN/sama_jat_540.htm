<p>Once two hunters, chiefs of villages, made a pact that if 
their children happened to be of different sexes, they should marry each other. 
One had a boy called Dukūlaka, because he was born in a wrapping of fine cloth; 
the other had a daughter called Pārikā, because she was born beyond the river. 
When they grew up the parents married them, but, because they had both come from 
the Brahma world, they agreed not to consummate the marriage. With their 
parents' consent they became ascetics, and lived in a hermitage provided for 
them by Sakka on the banks of the Migasammatā. Sakka waited on them, and 
perceiving great danger in store for them, persuaded them to have a son. The 
conception took place by Dukūlaka touching Pārikā’s navel at the proper time. 
When the son was born they called him Sāma, and, because he was of golden 
colour, he came to be called Suvannasāma. He was the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>One day, after Sāma was grown up, his parents, returning 
from collecting roots and fruits in the forest, took shelter under a tree on an 
anthill. The water which dripped from their bodies angered a snake living in the 
anthill, and his venomous breath blinded them both. When it grew late Sāma went 
in search of them and brought them home. From then onwards he looked after them.</p>
<p>Piliyakkha, king of Benares, while out hunting one day, 
leaving his mother in charge of the kingdom, saw Sāma drawing water, and, lest 
he should escape, shot at him with his arrow. The king took him for some 
supernatural being, seeing that the deer, quite fearless, drank of the water 
while Sāma was filling his jar.</p>
<p>When Piliyakkha heard who Sāma was and of how he was the 
mainstay of his parents, he was filled with grief. Sāma fell down fainting from 
the poisoned arrow, and the king thought him dead. A goddess, Bahusodarī, who 
had been Sāma’s mother seven births earlier, lived in Gandhamādana and kept 
constant watch over him. This day she had gone to an assembly of the gods and 
had forgotten him for a while, but she suddenly became aware of the danger into 
which he had fallen. She stood in the air near Piliyakkha, unseen by him, and 
ordered him to go and warn Sāma’s parents. He did as he was commanded, and, 
having revealed his identity, gradually informed them of Sāma’s fate and his own 
part in it. But neither Dukūlaka nor Pārikā spoke to him one word of resentment. 
They merely asked to be taken to where Sāma’s body lay. Arrived there, Pārikā 
made a solemn Act of Truth (saccakiriyā), and the poison left Sāma’s body, 
making him well.</p>
<p>Bahusodarī did likewise in Gandhamādana, and Sāma’s 
parents regained their sight. Then Sāma preached to the marvelling king, telling 
him how even the gods took care of those who cherished their parents.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a young man of 
Sāvatthi. Having heard the Buddha preach, he obtained his parents' leave with 
great difficulty and joined the Order. Five years he lived in the monastery, 
and, failing to attain insight, he returned to the forest and strove for twelve 
years more. His parents grew old, and as there was no one to look after them, 
their retainers robbed them of their goods. Their son, hearing of this from a 
monk who visited him in the forest, at once left his hermitage and returned to 
Sāvatthi. There he tended his parents, giving them food and clothing which he 
acquired by begging, often starving himself that they might eat. Other monks 
blamed him for supporting lay folk, and the matter was reported to the Buddha. 
But the Buddha, hearing his story, praised him and preached to him the 
Mātuposaka Sutta (q.v.).</p>
<p>Dukūlaka is identified with Kassapa, Pārikā with Bhaddā 
Kāpilānī, Piliyakkha with Ānanda, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Bahusodarī with 
Uppalavannā (J.vi.68 95; the story is referred to at Mil.198f.; J.iv.90, etc.; 
see also Mtu.ii.212 ff).</p>
<p>The <a href="salikedara_jat484.htm" title="sa/salikedara_jat484.htm">Sālikedāra Jātaka</a> was preached in reference to 
the same monk.</p>
