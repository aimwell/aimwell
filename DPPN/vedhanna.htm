<p>A family of Sākiyans. <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (DA.iii.905) they 
were skilled in archery (hence their name the “Archers”). They learnt their 
craft in a technical college (sippuggahanapāsāda) built in a mango grove. </p>
<p>It was 
there that the <a href="pasadika_sutta.htm" title="pa/pasadika_sutta.htm">Pāsādika Sutta</a> was preached (D.iii.17). </p>
<p>From the <a href="samagama.htm" title="sa/samagama.htm">Sāmagāma Sutta</a> (M.ii.244) it would appear that 
these Sākiyans lived in Sāmagāma.</p>
