  <h2>Kalyānī</h2>

<p>The name of a river and of the district 
near its mouth in Ceylon. The Buddha visited the Kalyāni country in the eighth 
year after the Enlightenment, in company with five hundred monks, on the second 
day after the full-moon of Vesākha and, seated on the spot where the 
Kalyāni-Cetiya was later built, he preached to the Nāgas and their king 
Maniakkhika, at whose invitation he had come (Sp.i.89; Mhv.i.63, 75ff; 
Dpv.ii.42, 53; J.ii.128).  </p>
<p>Once a king reigned in Kalyānī named Kalyani-Tissa, 
who had a daughter <a href="vihaaradevii.htm" title="vy/vihaaradevii.htm">Vihāramahādevī</a>. According to the legends connected 
with her, Kalyānī was at one time much further from the sea than it is now. The 
sea swallowed up several leagues of land (Mhv.xxii.12ff). King Yatthāla-Tissa 
built a five-storied pāsāda in the town, which was later restored by 
Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxv.64).</p>
<p>The Kalyāni district formed the fighting 
base of several campaigns. E.g., Cv.lxi.35, 39; lxxii.151.</p>
