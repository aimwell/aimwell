<p>The name given to the Nandanavana in 
Anurādhapura after Mahinda had preached there, converting a large number of 
people (Sp.i.82: Mhv.xv.202). It was situated immediately before the south gate 
of the city (Ibid., 1, 7, 8). It was included in the boundaries of the 
Mahāvihāra and, later, Mahāsena built the Jetavana-vihāra in Jotivana 
(Mhv.xxxvii.33).</p>
<p>It is said (DA.i.131; see also 
Cv.xxxvii.65; lii.59) that when Mahinda preached at Jotivana there was an 
earthquake.</p>
