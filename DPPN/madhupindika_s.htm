  <h2>Madhupindika Sutta</h2>

<p>Dandapāni meets the Buddha at the Mahāvana near 
Kapilavatthu and questions him as to his tenets. The Buddha explains that his 
tenets are such that they avoid all strife and make a man dwell above all 
pleasures of sense, etc. Dandapāni shakes his head and walks on, without 
comment.</p>
<p>Later in the evening the Buddha visits the Nigrodhārāma 
and tells the monks there briefly how to get rid of all obsessions, so that all 
evil and wrong states of mind are quelled and pass away entirely. After the 
Buddha’s departure the monks seek Mahā Kaccāna and ask him to expound in detail 
what the Buddha has told them in brief. Kaccāna explains that where there is eye 
and visible form, visual consciousness arises, this begets contact, contact 
conditions feeling, what a man feels he perceives, what he perceives he reasons 
about, and this leads to obsession. It is the same with the other senses. The 
monks report this explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it and praises 
Kaccāna’s earning and insight. Ānanda praises the discourse, comparing it to a 
honeyed pill of delicious savour, and the Buddha suggests that the sutta should 
be remembered by that name (Madhupindika) (M.i.108-14).</p>
<p>Nāgita was; among those present when the sutta was 
preached. He was thereby persuaded to enter the Order, and soon after became an 
arahant. ThagA.i.183.</p>
