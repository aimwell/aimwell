<p>He belonged to a wealthy family of Kosala. Having listened 
to a sermon on impermanence, after coming of age, he joined the Order and 
attained arahantship.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago, in the time of Sikhī Buddha, he was 
a cowherd. After the death of the Buddha he heard a monk preach on his virtues, 
and, acquiring discernment of impermanence, he paid great honour to the Buddha’s 
bodhi tree. In his last life he recalled this act with great joy, as having 
helped him to win the goal. Thag.vs.217f.; ThagA.i.337f.</p>
