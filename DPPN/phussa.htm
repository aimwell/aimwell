<h4>1. Phussa</h4>
<p>The eighteenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in 
the Sirimāuyyāna in Kāsi, his father being the khattiya Jayasena and his mother 
Sirimā. AA. (i. 144) says that his father was Mahinda and that he had three 
stepbrothers. One of them was Uruvela Kassapa (i. 165) in this birth.</p>
<p>He lived for six thousand years in three palaces: Garula, 
Hamsa and Suvannabhara. His wife was Kisāgotamī and his son Ānanda (or Anūpama). 
His body was fifty eight cubits high. He left the world riding an elephant, and 
practised austerities for six months. A setthi’s daughter, Sirivaddhā, gave him 
milk rice, while an ascetic, named Sirivaddha, gave him grass for his seat, 
under an āmanda (or āmalaka )tree. His chief disciples were Sukhita (or 
Surakkhita) and Dhammasena among men and Cālā (or Sālā) and Upacālā (Upasālā) 
among women. His personal attendant was Sambhiya. Dhanañjaya and Visākha among 
men, and Padumā and Nāgā among women, were his chief lay patrons. The Bodhisatta 
was a khattiya named Vijitāvī of Arimanda. The Buddha lived for ninety thousand 
years and died at the Sonārāma (Setārāma) in Kusinārā. His relies were scattered 
(Bu.xix.1ff.; BuA.192f.; PvA.19f). Ambapālī was his sister. Ap.ii. 613.</p>

<h4>2. Phussa Thera</h4>
<p>He was the son of a ruler of a province and was trained in 
all accomplishments. Having heard a great Thera preach, he left the world and 
joined the Order. He practised jhāna and became an arahant. One day an ascetic 
named Pandarassagotta heard him preach and questioned him on the future progress 
of Bhikkhus. Phussa’s reply is contained in the Theragāthā, vs. 949 80; 
ThagA.ii.82f.</p>
