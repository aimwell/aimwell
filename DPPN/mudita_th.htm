  <h2>Mudita Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a commoner’s family in Kosala, and when, 
for some reason, his clan fell into disfavour with the king, Mudita ran away 
into the forest and came across the dwelling of an arahant. The latter, noting 
Mudita’s terror, comforted and ordained him at his request. Mudita practiced 
insight, and refused to leave his cell till he had attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder and 
gave the Buddha a bed (Thag.311 14; ThagA.i.401f). He is identified with 
Mañcadāyaka (wrongly called Sajjhadāyaka) of the Apadāna. Ap.i.284f.</p>
