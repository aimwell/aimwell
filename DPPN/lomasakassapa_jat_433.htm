  <h2>Lomasakassapa Jātaka (No. 433)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Kassapa, son of the 
chaplain to the king of Benares. He and the king’s son shared a teacher and 
became friends. When the prince became king, Kassapa, having no desire for 
power, left him and became an ascetic. Because of the thick hair on his body, 
men called him Lomasakassapa. Sakka grew frightened of Kassapa’s power and, 
wishing to destroy it, appeared before the king at midnight and suggested to him 
that if he could persuade Kassapa to offer a sacrifice of slain beasts, he 
should be king over all India. The king, therefore, sent his minister Sayha, to 
fetch Kassapa to him. When Kassapa heard of the proposal he refused to go, but 
Sakka appeared again before the king and said that if the king’s daughter, 
Candavadī, were offered as reward, Kassapa would come. This proposal was agreed 
to, and Kassapa, tempted by the princess’s beauty, agreed to come. The people 
gathered at the place of sacrifice and tried to dissuade Kassapa from slaying 
the animals, but he refused to listen. Many beasts were slain, and as he raised 
his sword to cut off the head of the royal elephant the latter raised a cry in 
which all the animals joined. Roused by this uproar, Kassapa remembered his 
asceticism and was filled with remorse. He admonished the king, and, sitting 
cross-legged in the air, developed transcendental power, which enabled him to 
fly through the air.</p>
<p>The story was related to a passion tossed monk. Sayha ifs 
identified with Sāriputta. J.iii.514ff.; the story forms one of the dilemmas of 
the Milinda-Pañha, p. 219. There Kassapa is stated to have performed the 
Vājapeyya sacrifice.</p>
