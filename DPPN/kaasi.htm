<p><b>1. Kāsi (Kāsika).</b>-One of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (A.i.213, etc.), its capital being 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Bārānasī</a>.  </p>
<p>At the time of 
the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was 
king of both countries (D.i.288; M.ii.111). The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.28l), however, 
mentions a Kāsika-rājā (king of Kāsi?) who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Buddhaghosa 
(see Vinaya Texts ii.195, n.2) says that this was a brother of Pasenadi and son 
of the same father. He was probably a sub-king of Pasenadi. Pasenadi’s father, 
Mahākosala, on giving his daughter in marriage to Bimbisāra, allotted her a 
village of Kāsi (Kāsigāma, q.v.) as bath money (J.iv.342; J.ii.403; 
SA.i.110,120f, etc.). Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an 
independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very 
frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled 
by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhatarattha, was its king in the time of Renu 
(D.ii.235f). There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi 
and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, 
Dīghāti (q.v.), the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s 
son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom (Vin.i.334; J.iii.487; DhA.i.46). In another 
war the Kāsi king, Mahāsīlava, was taken captive by the ruler of Kosala, but his 
kingdom was later restored to him (J.i.262, etc.; see also i.409; UdA.123).</p>
<p>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi 
from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta (q.v.), and references to kings 
of that name abound in the Jātakas. Sometimes the king is referred to merely as 
Kāsi-rājā. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned are Kikī (M.ii.49) and Kalābu 
(J.iii.39). The extent of the Kāsi kingdom is given as three hundred leagues 
(J.v.41; also iii.304, 391).</p>
<p>The capital of Kāsi is generally given 
as Bārānasī, but it is said that when Asoka was king of Kāsi his capital was in 
Potali (J.iii.155), and another king, Udaya-bhadda, had his seat of government 
in Surundha (J.iv.104ff). It is possible that these cities did not form part of 
the regular kingdom of Kāsi, but became annexed to it during the reigns of some 
of the more powerful kings.</p>
<p>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of 
trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of 
caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to 
Rājagaha (Vin.i.212) and another to Sāvatthi (Vin.ii.10; Mhv.v.114). Kāsi was 
famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts, each 
robe being valued at one hundred thousand. (See, e.g., J.vi.151, 450; see also 
Addhakāsi). Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi (Kāsi-vilepana 
(J.i.355) and Kāsi-candana (A.iii.391; UdA.332)).</p>
<p>Besides those already referred to, other 
names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, 
Macchikāsanda (the kammantagāma of Anāthapindika), Kītāgiri and Dhammapālagāma 
(q.v.). Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. (E.g., A.v.59).</p>

<p><b>2. Kāsi, or Kāsika.</b>-A city, the 
birthplace of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.14; J.i.41). There he preached the 
Buddhavamsa (BuA.193). The city is probably to be identified with Benares, which 
is sometimes referred to as Kāsipura (E.g., DhA.i.71; J.v.54; vi.165; M.i.171; 
DhsA.35; Cv.xli.37). It is also called Kāsipurī (PvA.19).</p>
