<p>1. Kāma Sutta-The first of the 
Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. The Buddha, seeing a brahmin felling trees on 
the banks of the Aciravatī and preparing a field for corn, spoke to him. He 
spoke again to the brahmin on several other occasions, when the latter was 
engaged in various operations in the field. The brahmin, pleased by the Buddha’s 
courtesy, resolved to invite him to a meal when the harvest should be gathered. 
But the day before the reaping of the corn heavy rains fell, the river was 
flooded and the corn all washed away. The Buddha had foreseen that this would 
happen and visited the brahmin to console him. It was on this last occasion that 
this sutta was preached. At the end of the sermon the brahmin became a sotāpanna 
(Sn.vv.766-71; SnA.ii.511ff; J.iv.167f; cp. DhA.iii.284f; see also MNid.i.1ff). 
In the Kāmanīta Jātaka he is referred to as Kāmanīta-brāhmana. J.ii.212.</p>
<p>2. Kāma Sutta.-Contains questions asked 
by a deva and the Buddha’s answers thereto. A man should not become a slave or 
surrender himself as prey to others and speech should always be gentle. S.i.44.</p>
<p>3. Kāma or Kāmaguna Sutta.-On the five 
kinds of pleasures of the senses. A.iv.458; S.v.60.</p>
