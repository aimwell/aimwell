<p>An arahant. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a brahmin 
ascetic on Kukkurapabbata with a large number of disciples. Hearing of the 
Buddha’s appearance in the world, he wished to visit him, but fell ill on the 
way. He thereupon erected a thūpa of flowers in the Buddha’s name and died soon 
after. </p>
<p>Forty four kappas ago he was king sixteen times under the 
name of Aggisama, and thirty-eight times under that of Ghatāsana. Ap.i.155f.</p>
