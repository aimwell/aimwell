<p>A park in the <a href="cetiya.htm" title="c/cetiya.htm">Cetiya</a> kingdom (A.iv.228f). The 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> 
visited it during his tours, and once, while staying there with
<a href="meghiya.htm" title="me_mu/meghiya.htm">Meghīya</a>, the 
latter stopped in a mango grove in the village of <a href="jantugaama.htm" title="j/jantugaama.htm">Jantugāma</a>, refusing to go any 
farther (Ibid.,163). </p>
<p>The park lay between <a href="balakalonakarama.htm" title="b/balakalonakarama.htm">Bālakalonakāragāma</a> and the 
<a href="parileyya.htm" title="pa/parileyya.htm">Pārileyyakavana</a> (DhA.i.47). </p>
<p>Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila were living there during 
the time of the quarrel of the monks at Kosambī, and the Buddha visited them on 
his way to Pārileyyaka (Vin.i.350f.; cp. M.i.205ff). It was there that Anuruddha 
became an arahant (A.iv.228f.; AA.i.108). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (Ibid., ii.765) that the park was so 
called because it was to the east of where the Buddha lived (?) and it was 
covered with green bamboos.</p>
