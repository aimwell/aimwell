<p>A seaport. Thither came a man, saved 
from a wreck, without any clothes, who set up as a naked ascetic and became 
known by the name of Karambiya (v.l. Karamhiya). Among his followers was a 
Nāga-king, Pandara, and also a Garuda-king. At the latter’s request, he 
persuaded Pandara to tell him how the Nāgas escaped destruction by the Garudas, 
and later he divulged the secret to the Garuda-king. The ascetic’s treachery was 
discovered, and when he swore his innocence his head split in seven and he was 
dragged to Avīci. </p>
<p>The story is given in the Pandara Jātaka 
(J.v.75ff), and is referred to in the Milindapañha (p.201).</p>
