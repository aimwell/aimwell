<p>Mention is made in the books of the Magadhakhetta, 
probably an extensive rice field which at once caught the eye on account of its 
terraces. It could be seen from the Indasāla guhā (ThagA.i.333). The contour of 
the field struck the Buddha’s imagination and he asked Ānanda to design a robe 
of the same pattern. Ānanda did this very successfully, and this pattern has 
been adopted for the robes of members of the Order ever since (Vin.i.287).

<p>The Suvannnakakkata Jātaka (J.iii.293; also iv.277) 
mentions a field of one thousand karīsas (about eight thousand acres) in a 
brahmin village called SāIindiya to the east of Rājagaha. Magadhakhetta may 
sometimes have been used as another name for Magadha. See, e.g., AA.i.126, where 
NāIakagāma is mentioned as having been in Magadhakhetta.</p>
