<p><b>1. Vacchagotta. </b>A Paribbājaka, who later became an 
arahant Thera. Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the 
books. For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā 
Vacchagotta-, Vaccha- and Vacchagotta-Suttas. Some of these suttas are quoted in 
the Kathāvatthu (E.g., p. 267, 505). The Samyutta Nikāya contains a whole 
section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such 
mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the 
existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc. S.iii.257ff.; see also 
S.iv.391ff., for several discussions of Vacchagotta with Moggallāna, Ānanda and 
Sabhiya Kaccāna on similar topics. The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima 
Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta’s conversion, in due order: at 
the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta (No. 72) it is merely stated that “the 
Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.” At the end 
of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha 
as his teacher. In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the 
Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of 
four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has 
attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant’s understanding and asks 
for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the 
study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā may be acquired. Vacchagotta 
profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news 
of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has 
already heard the news from the devas (M.i.493 97).</p>
<p>This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the 
Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā 
(vs. 112). According to the Commentary (ThagA.i.221), he belonged to a rich 
brahmin family of the Vaccha clan (Vacchagotta). His personal name is not given. 
He became an expert in brahmin learning, but failing to find therein what he 
sought, he became a Paribbājaka, joining the Buddha’s Order later.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder of 
Bandhumatī, and one day, when the Buddha and his monks were invited to the 
king’s palace, he swept the street along which the Buddha passed and set up a 
Rag as decoration. As a result he was born, four kappas ago, as a rājā, Sudhaja 
by name. He is probably identical with Vīthisammajjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.177.</p>

<p><b>2. Vacchagotta.</b> A Paribbājaka. He is mentioned in 
the Anguttara Nikāva (A.i.180f ) as visiting the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he 
was at the head of the brahmins. He is possibly to be identified with 
Vacchagotta (1). In this context, however, he is called Venāgapurika. 
Vacchagotta (1) (q.v.) was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled 
widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli (M.i.481), at Sāvatthi 
(M.i.483; S.iii.257), and at Ñātikā (S.iv. 401), in addition to his visits to 
Rājagaha (M.i.489). The Commentary (AA.i.410), moreover, explains Venāgapuraka 
by “Venāgapuravāsī,” which may mean that he merely lived at Venāgapura and was 
not necessarily a native of that place. Vacchagotta’s question was as to how the 
Buddha looked so shining and his colour so clear? Was it because he slept on a 
luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable, 
but from quite a different point of view. At the end of the discourse, 
Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha.</p>
