<p>An arahant. He was a householder named 
Datta of Sāvatthi. On discovering that he had, though unwittingly, committed 
incest with both his mother and sister, he was overcome with anguish and left 
the world. He adopted a course of austerity, dwelling in a hut of palm leaves on 
the bank of the Ganges, hence his name. For a whole year he kept silence; in the 
second year he spoke but once to a woman who, in filling his bowl, spilt the 
milk, wishing to discover if he were dumb. In the third year he became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a householder, and supplied drinks to monks (Thag.v.127-8; ThagA.i.248f).</p>
<p>It is said (ThagA.195f.; Thig.224f) that 
after Gangātiriya’s conception his mother was driven out of her house in the 
absence of her husband, her mother-in-law suspecting her of infidelity. The 
child was born in a travellers' rest-house in Rājagaha, whither she had gone in 
search of her husband, and was taken away by a caravan leader who happened to 
see it when its mother was away bathing. Later the woman was carried away by a 
robber chief, by whom she had a daughter. One day, in a quarrel with her 
husband, she threw her daughter on the bed, wounding her on the head, and 
fearing her husband’s wrath she fled to Rājagaha, where she became a courtesan 
and later mistress of Gangātiriya, who was unaware of his relationship to her. 
Some time afterwards he took to wife the robber’s daughter as well. One day, 
while looking at the young wife’s head, the older one saw the wound, and as a 
result of her questions learnt the truth. Filled with dismay, both mother and 
daughter became nuns, and Gangātiriya left the world as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Gangātiriya is perhaps to be identified 
with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna. (Ap.ii.437; but the verses are also ascribed to 
Mahāgavaccha, ThagA.i.57).</p>
