<p>A <a href="niraya.htm" title="n/niraya.htm">Niraya</a>. Beings born there suffer from excessive heat 
(SNA.i.59; J.iii.22; v. 269). The Niraya extends under the whole of the earth 
and is four nahutas and one hundred thousand yojanas in depth. It is like a 
cauldron filled up to the brim with molten metal (SNA.ii.480).</p>
<p>It is said (Mhv.iv.38) that when Kālāsoka attempted to 
extend his patronage to the Vajjiputtaka monks, the devas frightened him with a 
dream that be had been cast into Lohakumbhī. See also the
