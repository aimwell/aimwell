<p><b>1. Seniya.</b> A naked ascetic who practised the 
“Canine vow,” behaving like a dog. After his visit to the Buddha, as recorded in 
the Kukkuravatika Sutta (q.v.), he joined the Order and, in due course, became 
an arahant. M.i.387ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Seniya.</b> The personal name, according to 
Buddhaghosa, of King Bimbisāra (MA.i.292; but see SNA.ii.448, mahatiyā senāya 
samannāgatattā), who is almost always referred to as Seniya Bimbisāra. 
Dhammapāla says (UdA.104), however, that Bimbisāra was called Seniya either 
because he had a large army, or because he belonged to the Seniya-gotta (mahatiyā 
senāya samannāgātatta vā Seniyagottatā vā).</p>
