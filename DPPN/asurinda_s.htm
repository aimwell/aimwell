  <h2>Asurinda (Asurindaka) Sutta</h2>

<p>Recounts an interview between the Buddha 
and Asurinda Bh훮radv훮ja in Veluvana. When Asurinda heard that Bh훮radv훮ja 
(probably the chief of the clan) had entered the Order, he was greatly vexed, 
and going up to the Buddha he abused him. The Buddha remaining silent, Asurinda 
thought that he acknowledged defeat. But the Buddha enlightened him, saying that 
the worse of the two is he who, when reviled, reviles back; he who does not so 
revile wins a twofold victory: he seeks the good both of himself and of the 
other (S.i.163f.; SA.i.178).</p>
