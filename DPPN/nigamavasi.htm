<p>A thera of a market town (nigama) near Sāvatthi. He had 
the reputation of being contented, purged and pure; he went for his alms only in 
the village of his kinsmen. When it was reported to the Buddha that Tissa lived 
in intimate association with his relations, the Buddha questioned him and 
accepted his explanation, praising him, and remarking that Tissa’s good 
qualities were the result of association with himself; he then related the 
Mahāsuka Jātaka. DhA.i.283 6. The introductory story of the Jātaka (q.v.), 
however, gives a different reason for its recital (J.ii.490f.).</p>
