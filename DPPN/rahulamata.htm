  <h2>Rāhulamātā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The name, generally given in the texts, of <a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula’s</a> mother (E.g., 
Vin.i.82) and <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama’s</a> wife.  </p>
<p>She is also called Bhaddakaccā,* and, in later 
texts, Yasodharā (BuA., p.245; Dvy.253), Bimbādevī (J.ii.392f.; DA.ii.422) and, 
probably, Bimbāsundarī (J.vi.478 [12]).  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* E.g., Bu.xxvi.15; Mhv.ii.24 calls her Bhaddakaccānā; but see Thomas, op. 
  cit., 49; she is also called Subhaddakā, this being probably a variant of 
  Bhaddakaccānā.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>The Northern texts seem to favour the 
name of Yasodharā, but they call her the daughter of 
<a href="dandapaanii.htm" title="d/dandapaanii.htm">Dandapānī</a>. (See also Rockhill, op. cit., 
where various other names are given as well). It is probable 
that the name of Gotama’s wife was Bimbā, and that Bhaddakaccā, Subhaddakā, 
Yosadhāri and the others, were descriptive epithets applied to her, which later 
became regarded as, additional names. It is also possible that in Gotama’s court 
there was also a Yasodharā, daughter of Dandapānī, and that there was a later 
confusion of names. The Commentarial explanation (E.g., AA.i.204), that she was 
called Bhaddakaccānā because her body was the colour of burnished gold, is 
probably correct. To suggest (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 49) that the name bears 
any reference to the Kaccānagotta seems to be wrong, because the Kaccāna was a 
brahmin gotta and the Sākiyans were not brahmins.</p>
<p>Rāhulamātā was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA. 106, 
228). She married him (Gotama) at the age of sixteen (the following account is 
taken chiefly from J.i.58ff), and was placed at the head of forty thousand 
women, given to Gotama by the Sākiyans, after he had proved his manly prowess to 
their satisfaction. Gotama left the household life on the day of the birth of 
his son Rāhula (according to one account, referred to in the Jātaka Commentary, 
i.62, Rāhula was seven days old). It is said that just before he left home he 
took a last look at his wife from the door of her room, not daring to go nearer, 
lest he should awake her. When the Buddha paid his first visit to Kapilavatthu 
after the Enlightenment, and on the second day of that visit, he begged in the 
street for alms. This news spread, and Rāhulamātā looked out of her window to 
see if it were true. She saw the Buddha, and was so struck by the glory of his 
personality that she uttered eight verses in its praise. These verses have been 
handed down under the name of <a href="narasihagata.htm" title="n/narasihagata.htm">Narasīhagāthā</a>; on that day, after the 
Buddha had finished his meal in the palace, which he took at the invitation of 
Suddhodana, all the ladies of the court, with the exception of Rāhulamātā, went 
to pay him obeisance. She refused to go, saying that if she had any virtue in 
her the Buddha would come to her. The Buddha went to her with his two chief 
Disciples and gave orders that she should be allowed to greet him as she wished. 
She fell at his feet, and clasping them with her hands, put her head on them. 
Suddhodana related to the Buddha how, from the time he had left home, Rāhulamātā 
had herself abandoned all luxury and had lived in the same manner as she had 
heard that the Buddha lived&nbsp;-&nbsp; wearing yellow robes, eating only once a 
day, etc. And the Buddha then related the
<a href="candakinnara_jat_485.htm" title="c/candakinnara_jat_485.htm">Candakinnara Jātaka</a>, to show 
how, in the past, too, her loyalty had been supreme.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of the Buddha’s visit, when he left the palace at the end 
of his meal, Rāhulamātā sent Rāhula to him saying, “That is your father, go and 
ask him for your inheritance.” Rāhula followed the Buddha, and, at the Buddha’s 
request, was ordained by Sāriputta. The account of this event is given in 
Vin.i.82; this is probably the only passage in the Pitakas where Rāhulamātā, is 
mentioned by name.</p>
<p>Later, when the Buddha allowed women to join the Order, Rāhulamātā became a 
nun under <a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī</a> (AA.i.198).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> identifies (AA.i.204f) Rāhulamātā with Bhaddakaccānā who, in the 
Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.25), is mentioned as chief among nuns in the possession of 
supernormal powers (mahābhiññappattānam). She was one of the four disciples of 
the Buddha who possessed such attainment, the others being 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>,
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> 
and <a href="bakkula.htm" title="b/bakkula.htm">Bakkula</a>. She expressed her desire for this achievement in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha.</p>
<p>In this account Bhaddakaccānā is mentioned as the daughter of the Sākyan 
Suppabuddha and his wife Amitā.* She joined the Order under Pajāpatī Gotamī in 
the company of Janapadakalyānī (Nandā), and in the Order she was known as 
Bhaddakaccānā Therī. Later, she developed insight and became an arahant. She 
could, with one effort, recall one asankheyya and one hundred thousand kappas 
(AA.i.205).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* Cf. Mhv.ii.21f. It is said (DhA.iii.44f) that Suppabuddha did not forgive 
  the Buddha for leaving his daughter; Devadatta was Bhaddakaccanā’s daughter, 
  and it has been suggested that Devadatta’s enmity against the Buddha was for 
  reasons similar to her father’s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Therī Apadāna (Ap.ii.584ff ) an account is found of a Therī, Yasodharā 
by name, who is evidently to be identified with Rāhulamātā, because she speaks 
of herself (vvs. 10, 11) as the Buddha’s pajāpatī before he left the household (agāra), 
and says that she was the chief (pāmokkhā sabbaissarā) of ninety thousand women.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="diipankara.htm" title="d/diipankara.htm">Dīpankara</a> Buddha, when the Bodhisatta was born as 
<a href="sumedha.htm" title="s/sumedha.htm">Sumedha</a>, she 
was a brahmin maiden, Sumittā by name, and gave eight handfuls of lotuses to 
Sumedha, which he, in turn, offered to the Buddha. Dīpankara, in declaring that 
Sumedha would ultimately become the Buddha, added that Sumittā would be his 
companion in several lives. The Apadāna account (vvs. 1ff ) mentions how, just 
before her death, at the age of seventy eight, she took leave of the Buddha and 
performed various miracles. It also states (Ap.ii.592f ) that eighteen thousand 
arahants nuns, companions of Yasodharā, also died on the same day.</p>
<p>The <a href="abbhantara_jat_281.htm" title="am/abbhantara_jat_281.htm">Abbhantara Jātaka</a>* mentions that Bimbādevī (who is called the chief wife 
of Gotama and is therefore evidently identical with Rāhulamātā) was once, after 
becoming a nun, ill from flatulence. When Rāhula, as was his custom, came to 
visit her, he was told that he could not see her, but that, when she had 
suffered from the same trouble at home, she had been cured by mango juice with 
sugar. Rāhula reported the matter to his preceptor, Sāriputta, who obtained the 
mango juice from Pasenadi. When Pasenadi discovered why the mango juice had been 
needed, he arranged that from that day it should be regularly supplied. The 
Jātaka relates how, in a past birth too, Sāriputta had come to Rāhulamātā’s 
rescue.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* J.ii.392f.; cf. the <a href="supatta_jat_292.htm" title="s/supatta_jat_292.htm">Supatta Jātaka</a>, where Sāriputta, at Rāhula’s request, 
  obtained for her from Pasenadi rice with ghee, flavoured with red fish. This 
  was for abdominal pain (J.ii.433).</p>
</blockquote>
