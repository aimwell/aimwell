<p>A heretical sect among the Buddhists, an offshoot or 
Gokulikā (Mhv.v.5; Mbv.p.97). </p>
<p>The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.v.41) calls the adherents of this sect 
Bahusuttakā. According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, p.183) they derived their 
name from their teacher, Bahusrutiya. In addition to the five propositions held 
by the Mahāsanghikas, they considered it as a fundamental doctrine that there is 
no mode of life leading to real salvation, that the truth of suffering is the 
Noble Truth, that to perceive the suffering of the samskāras is to enter perfect 
purity, that there is no way of seeing the misery of suffering and the misery of 
change; the Sangha is but subject to worldly laws and conditions, arahants 
acquire the doctrine of others, there is a rightly preached way and a right 
entry into samāpatti. Ibid., 189.</p>
