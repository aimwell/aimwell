  <h2>Vissakamma, Vissukamma</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A deva, inhabitant of Tāvatimsa. He is the chief 
architect, designer and decorator among the devas, and Sakka asks for his 
services whenever necessary. Thus he was ordered to build the palace called 
Dhamma for Mahāsudassana (D.ii.180) and another for Mahāpanāda (J.iv.323; 
DA.iii.856). </p>
<p>He also built the hermitages for the Bodhisatta in various 
births — e.g., as </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sumedha (J.i.7)</li>
  <li>Kuddālapandita (J.i.314)</li>
  <li>Hatthipāla (J.iv.489)</li>
  <li>Ayoghara (J.iv.499)</li>
  <li>Jotipāla (J.v.132)</li>
  <li>Sutasoma (J.v.190)</li>
  <li>Temiya (J.vi.21, 29) </li>
  <li>Vessantara (J.vi.519f)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vissakamma also built the hermitage for Dukūlaka and 
Pārikā (J.vi.72).</p>
<p>On the day that the Buddha renounced the world, Sakka sent 
Vissakamma in the guise of a shampooer to bathe him and clothe him in his royal 
ornaments (J.i.60; DhA.i.70; BuA.232; he also constructed ponds in which the 
prince might bathe, AA.i.379); he also sent him to adorn Temiya on the day he 
left the kingdom (J.vi.12). </p>
<p>Vissakamma erected the jewelled pavilion, twelve leagues 
in compass, under the Gandamba, where the Buddha performed the Twin Miracle and 
built the three stairways of jewels, silver and gold, used by the Buddha in his 
descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa (J.iv.265f). He built, the pavilions in which 
the Buddha and five hundred arahants travelled to Uggapura, at the invitation of 
Culla Subhaddā. (DhA.iii.470; and again for the journey to Sunāpuranta, 
MA.ii.1017). </p>
<p>When Ajātasattu deposited his share of the Buddha’s relics 
in a thūpa, Sakka ordered Vissakamma to construct around the thūpa a 
vālasanghātayanta (revolving wheel?) to prevent anyone from approaching the 
relics. Later, when Dhammāsoka (Piyadassī) wished to obtain these relics for his 
vihāra, Vissakamma appeared before him in the guise of a village youth and, by 
shooting an arrow at the controlling screw of the machine, stopped its 
revolutions (DA.ii.613, 614). </p>
<p>He constructed the jewelled pavilion in which Sonuttara 
placed the relies he brought from the Nāga world till the time came for them to 
be deposited in the Mahā Thūpa, (Mhv.xxxi.76) and on the day of their 
enshrinement, Vissakamma, acting on Sakka’s orders, decorated the whole of 
Ceylon (Mhv.xxxi.34). He also provided the bricks used in the construction of 
the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.8). Sometimes he would enter into a workman’s body 
and inspire him with ideas — e.g., in designing 
the form of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.11). He was also responsible for the 
construction of the golden vase in which the branch of the Bodhi tree was 
conveyed to Ceylon (Mhv.xviii.24).</p>
<p>As in the case of Mātalī and Sakka, Vissakamma is 
evidently the name of an office and not a personal name. Thus, in the Suruci 
Jātaka (J.iv. 325), Vissakamma is mentioned as a previous birth of Ānanda, 
while, according to the Dhammapada Commentary, the architect who helped Magha 
and his companions in their good works, was reborn as Vissakamma. DhA.i.272. The 
story given regarding Vissakamma in SNA.i.233, evidently refers to the Mahākanha 
Jātaka. The deva who accompanied Sakka in the guise of a dog in that Jātaka was 
Mātali and not Vissakamma.</p>
