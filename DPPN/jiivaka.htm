<p><b>1. JÄ«vaka-KomÄrabhacca.</b>-A celebrated 
physician. He was the son of <a href="salavati.htm" title="sa/salavati.htm">SÄlavatÄ«</a>, a courtesan of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">RÄjagaha</a>. (AA. (i.216) 
says that <a href="abhaya.htm" title="am/abhaya.htm">AbhayarÄjakumÄra</a> was his father). Directly after birth the child was 
placed in a basket and thrown on a dust-heap, from where he was rescued by 
AbhayaràjakumÄra. When questioned by Abhaya, people said â€œhe was aliveâ€ (jÄ«vati), 
and therefore the child was called JÄ«vaka; because he was brought up by the 
prince (kumÄrena posÄpito), he was called KomÄrabhacca. It has been suggested, 
however, that KomÄrabhacca meant master of the KaumÄrabhrtya science (the 
treatment of infants); VT.ii.174; in Dvy. (506-18) he is called KumÄrabhÅ«ta.
</p>
<p>When grown up, he learnt of his 
antecedents, and going to <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">TakkasilÄ</a> without Abhayaâ€™s knowledge, studied medicine 
for seven years. His teacher then gave him a little money and sent him away as 
being fit to practise medicine. His first patient was the setthiâ€™s wife at 
SÄketa, and for curing her he received sixteen thousand kahÄpanas, a manservant, 
a maid-servant and a coach with horses. When he returned to RÄjagaha, Abhaya 
established him in his own residence. There he cured 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">BimbisÄra</a> of a troublesome 
fistula and received as reward all the ornaments of BimbisÄraâ€™s five hundred 
wives. He was appointed physician to the king and the kingâ€™s women and also to 
the fraternity of monks with the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at its head. Other cures of JÄ«vakaâ€™s 
included that of the setthi of RÄjagaha on whom he performed the operation of 
trepanning, and of the son of the setthi of Benares who had suffered from 
chronic intestinal trouble due to misplacement, and for this case JÄ«vaka 
received sixteen thousand kahÄpanas.</p>
<p>When <a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Candappajjota</a>, king of 
<a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>, was 
ill, BimbisÄra lent JÄ«vaka to him. Candappajjota hated ghee, which was, however, 
the only remedy. JÄ«vaka prepared the medicine, prescribed it for the king, then 
rode away on the kingâ€™s elephant BhaddavatikÄ before the king discovered the 
nature of the medicine. Pajjota, in a rage, ordered his capture and sent his 
slave KÄka after him. KÄka discovered JÄ«vaka breakfasting at KosambÄ« and allowed 
himself to be persuaded to eat half a myrobalan, which purged him violently. 
JÄ«vaka explained to KÄka that he wished to delay his return; he told him why he 
had fled from the court and, having returned the elephant, proceeded to 
RÄjagaha. Pajjota was cured and, as a token of his favour, sent JÄ«vaka a suit of 
SÄ«veyyaka cloth, which JÄ«vaka presented to the Buddha (Vin.i.268-81; AA.i.216). 
JÄ«vaka was greatly attracted by the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was ill, JÄ«vaka 
found it necessary to administer a purge, and he had fat rubbed into the 
Buddhaâ€™s body and gave him a handful of lotuses to smell. JÄ«vaka was away when 
the purgative acted, and suddenly remembered that he had omitted to ask the 
Buddha to bathe in warm water to complete the cure. The Buddha read his thoughts 
and bathed as required. Vin.i.279f; DhA. (ii.164f), relates a like occurrence in 
another connection. When the Buddhaâ€™s foot was injured by the splinter from the 
rock hurled by <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>, he had to be carried from
<a href="maddakucci.htm" title="ma/maddakucci.htm">Maddakucchi</a> to JÄ«vakaâ€™s 
Ambavana. There JÄ«vaka applied an astringent, and having bandaged the wound, 
left the city expecting to return in time to remove it. But by the time he did 
return, the city gates were closed and he could not enter. He was greatly 
worried because he knew that if the bandage remained on all night the Buddha 
would suffer intense pain. But the Buddha read his thoughts and removed the 
bandage. See also J.v.333.</p>
<p>After JÄ«vaka became a SotÄpanna, he was 
anxious to visit the Buddha twice a day, and finding 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a> too far away, he 
built a monastery with all its adjuncts in his own Ambavana in RÄjagaha, which 
he gave to the Buddha and his monks (DA.i.133; MA.ii.590). When BimbisÄra died, 
JÄ«vaka continued to serve AjÄtasattu, and was responsible for bringing him to 
the Buddha after his crime of parricide. (For details see the SÄmaÃ±Ã±aphala 
Sutta; also J.i.508f; v.262, etc.).</p>
<p>JÄ«vakaâ€™s fame as a physician brought him 
more work than he could cope with, but he never neglected his duties to the 
Sangha. Many people, afflicted with disease and unable to pay for treatment by 
him, joined the Order in order that they might receive that treatment. On 
discovering that the Order was thus being made a convenience of, he asked the 
Buddha to lay down a rule that men afflicted with certain diseases should be 
refused entry into the Order (Vin.i.71ff). JÄ«vaka was declared by the Buddha 
chief among his lay followers loved by the people (aggam puggalappasannÄnam) 
(A.i.26). He is included in a list of good men who have been assured of the 
realisation of deathlessness (A.iii.451; DhA.i.244, 247; J.i.116f).</p>
<p>At a meal once given by JÄ«vaka, the 
Buddha refused to be served until CÅ«lapanthaka, who had been left out of the 
invitation, had been sent for. (For details see 
<a href="cuula_panthaka_th.htm" title="c/cuula_panthaka_th.htm">CÅ«lapanthaka</a>). It may have been 
the preaching of the <a href="jiivaka_s.htm" title="j/jiivaka_s.htm">JÄ«vaka Sutta</a> which effected JÄ«vakaâ€™s conversion. One 
discussion he had with the Buddha regarding the qualities of a pious lay 
disciple is recorded in the Anguttara NikÄya (A.iv.222f). 
<a href="sirimaa.htm" title="s/sirimaa.htm">SirimÄ</a> was JÄ«vakaâ€™s 
youngest sister (SNA.i.244; DhA.iii.106).</p>
<p>At JÄ«vakaâ€™s request, the Buddha enjoined 
upon monks to take exercise; JÄ«vaka had gone to <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">VesÄli</a> on business and had 
noticed their pale, unhealthy took (Vin.ii.119).</p>
