<p>King of Benares. A son was born to him 
who was named Dutthakumāra, and who, according to the fortune-tellers, would die 
for lack of water. In order to falsify the prophecy, the king guarded his son 
closely, made numerous tanks near the city, and saw that vessels of water were 
placed wherever possible. One day, while returning from the park, the prince saw 
a Pacceka Buddha, and being angry that obeisance should be paid to the Buddha 
instead of to himself, he took the Buddha’s bowl and dashed it on the ground. 
The prince’s body burst into flames, but all the water around having dried up, 
they could not be quenched and he was swallowed up in hell. When Kitavāsa heard 
of this he was greatly grieved, but on reflection he realised that his grief 
sprang from affection, and thenceforth resolved to fix his love on nothing.</p>
<p>Kitavāsa is identified with Chattapāni 
of the Dhammaddhaja Jātaka, Chattapāni himself being a former birth of Sāriputta 
(J.ii.194ff).</p>
<p>The story of Kitavāsa’s son bears close 
resemblance to that of Kitava’s son (see Kundinagariya Thera). Perhaps Kitava 
and Kitavāsa are identical.</p>
