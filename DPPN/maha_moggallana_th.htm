  <h2>MahÄ MoggallÄna Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The second of the Chief Disciples of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. He was 
born in <a href="kolitagaama.htm" title="ku/kolitagaama.htm">KolitagÄma</a> near 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">RÄjagaha</a>, on the same day as 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">SÄriputta</a> (they were both 
older than the Buddha), and was called Kolita after his village. His mother was 
a brahminee called MoggalÄ« (MoggallÄni), and his father was the chief, 
householder of the village. MoggallÄnaâ€™s and SÄriputtaâ€™s families had 
maintained an unbroken friendship for seven generations, and so the children 
were friends from their childhood. SÄriputta had five hundred golden palanquins 
and MoggallÄna five hundred carriages drawn by thoroughbreds. One day the two 
friends went together to see a mime play (giraggasamajjÄ), and there, realizing 
the impermanence of things, decided to renounce the world. They first lived as 
disciples of <a href="sanjaya.htm" title="sa/sanjaya.htm">SaÃ±jaya</a>, and then wandered all over 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">JambudÄ«pa</a>, discussing 
with all learned men, but finding no satisfaction. Then they separated, after 
agreeing that whoever first succeeded in finding what they sought should inform 
the other.</p>
<p>After some time, SÄriputta, wandering about in RÄjagaha, 
met  
<a href="assaji.htm" title="ay/assaji.htm">Assaji</a>, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a  sotÄpanna. He found MoggallÄna and repeated the stanza he had heard from 
<a href="assaji.htm" title="ay/assaji.htm">Assaji</a> 
(ye dhammÄ hetuppabhavÄ, etc.), and MoggallÄna also became a sotÄpanna. The two 
then resolved to visit the Buddha at <a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a>, after an unsuccessful attempt to 
persuade SaÃ±jaya to accompany them. SaÃ±jayaâ€™s disciples, however, five hundred 
in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veluvana. The Buddha preached 
to them, and ordained them by the â€œehi bhikkhu pabbajjÄ.â€ All became arahants 
except SÄriputta and MoggallÄna. MoggallÄna went to the hamlet of KallavÄla (for 
details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called KallavÄlamutta) 
in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness 
overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before 
him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.</p>
<p>On the day that SÄriputta and MoggallÄna were ordained, 
the Buddha announced in the assembly of monks that he had assigned to them the 
place of Chief Disciples and then recited the <a href="patimokkha.htm" title="pa/patimokkha.htm">PÄtimokkha</a>. The monks were 
offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour. But the Buddha told 
them how these two had for a whole asankheyya and one hundred thousand years 
strenuously exerted themselves to win this great eminence under him. They had 
made the first resolve in the time of <a href="anomadassii.htm" title="ay/anomadassii.htm">AnomadassÄ«</a> Buddha. MoggallÄna had been a 
householder, named Sirivaddha, and SÄriputta a householder, called Sarada. 
Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic. The Buddha visited 
him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed 
him great honour. AnomadassÄ«â€™s chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada 
made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha. 
AnomadassÄ« saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.</p>
<p>After the Buddhaâ€™s departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, 
and, announcing the Buddhaâ€™s prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place 
of second disciple. Acting on this advice, Sirivaddha made elaborate 
preparations and entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days. At the end 
of that time, he announced his wish to the Buddha, who declared that it would be 
fulfilled. From that time, the two friends, in that and subsequent births, 
engaged in good deeds. AA.i.84ff.; Ap.ii.31ff.; DhA.i.73f.; SNA.i.326ff.; the 
story of the present is given in brief at Vin.i.39ff.</p>
<p>SÄriputta and MoggallÄna are declared to be the ideal 
disciples, whose example others should try to follow (E.g., S.ii.235; A.i.88). 
In the <a href="saccavibhanga_sutta.htm" title="sa/saccavibhanga_sutta.htm">Saccavibhanga Sutta</a> (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these â€œtwin 
brethrenâ€ from the others: â€œSÄriputta is as she who brings forth and MoggallÄna 
is as the nurse of what is brought forth; SÄriputta trains in the fruits of 
conversion, MoggallÄna trains in the highest good. SÄriputta is able to teach 
and make plain the four Noble Truths; MoggallÄna, on the other hand, teaches by his iddhi-pÄtihÄriya.â€ (BuA.31) MoggallÄnaâ€™s pre eminence lay in his possession 
of iddhi power (A.i.23). He could create a living shape innumerable times and 
could transfer himself into any shape at will. Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as 
saying that he could crush <a href="sineru.htm" title="s/sineru.htm">Sineru</a> like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling 
the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potterâ€™s 
wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand. When 
the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in <a href="veranjaa.htm" title="vy/veranjaa.htm">VeraÃ±jÄ</a>, MoggallÄna offered to 
turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the 
under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from 
<a href="nalerupucimanda.htm" title="n/nalerupucimanda.htm">Nalerupu</a><a href="nalerupucimanda.htm" title="n/nalerupucimanda.htm">-cimanda</a> 
to <a href="uttarakuru.htm" title="u/uttarakuru.htm">Uttarakuru</a>, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was 
refused by the Buddha (Vin.iii.7; Sp.i.182f.; DhA.ii.153). </p>
<p>Several instances are given of this special display of 
iddhi. Once, at the Buddhaâ€™s request, with his great toe he shook the 
<a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">MigÄramÄtupÄsÄda</a>, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in 
the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless 
even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey. See 
<a href="pasadakampana.htm" title="pa/pasadakampana.htm">PasÄdakampana 
Sutta</a>, S.v.269ff.; also the <a href="utthaana_s.htm" title="u/utthaana_s.htm">UtthÄna Sutta</a>, SNA.i.336f.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when MoggallÄna visited 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> to find 
out if he had profited by the Buddhaâ€™s teaching, he found him far too proud and 
obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakkaâ€™s palace, 
Vejayanta, till Sakkaâ€™s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled 
(See <a href="cuula_tanhaasankhaya_s.htm" title="c/cuula_tanhaasankhaya_s.htm">CÅ«latanhÄsankhaya Sutta</a>, M.i.251ff). Again, MoggallÄna is mentioned as 
visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance 
of Baka BrahmÄ. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the SudhammÄ-Hall 
in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views 
were erroneous. Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f. ; other visits of his to 
the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa BrahmÄ 
(A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp. Mtu.i.54ff.). </p>
<p>In the MÄratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how 
MÄra worried MoggallÄna by entering into his belly, but MoggallÄna ordered him 
out and told him how he himself had once been a MÄra named DÅ«sÄ« whose sister 
KÄlÄ« was the mother of the present MÄra. DÅ«sÄ« incited the householders against 
Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p>
<p>But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), 
MoggallÄnaâ€™s greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the NÄga 
NandopÄ€nanda. No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was 
able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jhÄna; which was the reason why the 
Buddha would give permission to no other monk but MoggallÄna to quell the NÄgaâ€™s 
pride. Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the NÄga who lived near the 
hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.). MoggallÄna could see, without 
entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to 
the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; 
where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp. AvadÄnas i.246ff.). He 
would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their 
inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff. regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the 
Buddha used in illustration of his sermons. The VimÄnavatthu (see also 
DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such 
visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that MoggallÄnaâ€™s visits to the deva worlds
-&nbsp; e.g., that to TÄvatimsa&nbsp;&nbsp; were very 
welcome to the devas.</p>
<p>Though MoggallÄnaâ€™s pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet 
in wisdom, too, he was second only to SÄriputta. These two could answer 
questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227). The 
Buddha paid a compliment to MoggallÄnaâ€™s powers of preaching, when, having 
preached himself to the SÄkyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked 
MoggallÄna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was 
weary. And MoggallÄna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of 
them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff). 
Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on 
the jhÄnas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of 
visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear 
him preach. Other devas also went to hear him â€” 
e.g., Candana, SuyÄma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv. 269 80). He was 
also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa 
(A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. When the 
Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in TÄvatimsa, it was to MoggallÄna that he 
entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return. 
MoggallÄna, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while 
AnÄthapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219). When the time drew 
near for the Buddhaâ€™s return, MoggallÄna, at the request of the people, went to 
TÄvatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, 
in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be 
kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp. Dvy.375). No task, which he might be told 
by the Buddha to perform, seemed to MoggallÄna too insignificant. Thus we find 
him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him 
that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62). He was also sent to Sakkhara, 
to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., 
i.369f.; J.i.347); and to SÄ«lavÄ, whom AjÄtasattu was plotting to kill 
(ThagA.i.536). When VisakhÄ was building the MigÄramÄtupÄsÄda and the Buddha was 
away on one of his journeys, MoggallÄna, because of his iddhi power, and five 
hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without 
difficulty (DhA.i.414f). The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief 
disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance 
recorded of MoggallÄna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the 
door (A.iv.204ff.). Once, when a monk charged SÄriputta with having offended him 
as he was about to start on a journey, MoggallÄna and Ä€nanda went from lodging 
to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear SÄriputta vindicate himself 
(Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374). </p>
<p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we 
find Tudu BrahmÄ singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the KokÄlika 
monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them â€” 
e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p. 231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff). When Devadatta created a schism 
among the monks and took five hundred of them to GayÄsÄ«sa, the Buddha sent 
SÄriputta and MoggallÄna to bring them back. They were successful in this 
mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish 
the AssajipunabbasukÄ). Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of MoggallÄna and 
later born in a huge manomayakÄya, had warned MoggallÄna of Devadattaâ€™s 
intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to 
him by MoggallÄna (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff). When RÄhula, the Buddhaâ€™s son, was 
ordained, SÄriputta was his preceptor and MoggallÄna his teacher (J.i.161; see 
SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different. There MoggallÄna is spoken 
of as RÄhulaâ€™s kammavÄcÄriya.). MoggallÄna seems to have carried out diligently 
the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among 
the verses, attributed to him in the TheragÄthÄ, are several containing 
exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f 
); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name â€” 
e.g., Tissa, VaddhamÄna and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f). Elsewhere 
(S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at KÄlasilÄ, with a company of five 
hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. 
VangÄ«sa witnessed this and praised MoggallÄna in verse before the Buddha.</p>
<p>The love existing between MoggallÄna and SÄriputta was 
mutual, as was the admiration. SÄriputtaâ€™s verses in praise of MoggallÄna 
(Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of MoggallÄna in praise of 
SÄriputta (Thag.vss.1176). Their strongest bond was the love of each for the 
Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been 
conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. E.g., 
S.ii.275ff.; MoggallÄna elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a 
conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For 
another discussion between SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, see A.ii.154f. </p>
<p>In the MahÄgosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in 
the GosingasÄlavana in the company of MahÄ Kassapa, Ä€nanda, Revata and 
Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the 
Buddha for his opinion. SÄriputta, MoggallÄna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned 
(S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the KetakÄ«vana in SÄketa. Among discussions 
between Anuruddha and MoggallÄna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of 
the value of cultivating the four satipatthÄnas (S.v.294f). It seems to have 
been usual for SÄriputta and MoggallÄna, in their journeys, to travel together 
at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were 
anxious to include them in their invitations. Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri 
(A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in MacchikÄsanda (DhA.ii.74f.).</p>
<p>MoggallÄna died before the Buddha, SÄriputta dying before 
either. The TheragÄthÄ contains several verses attributed to MoggallÄna 
regarding SÄriputtaâ€™s death (vs.1158 61). SÄriputta died on the full moon day of 
Kattika and MoggallÄna two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181). 
 
</p>
<p>According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the 
Niganthas. MoggallÄna used to visit various worlds and return with his report 
that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddhaâ€™s teaching reached 
happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful 
conditions. These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they 
bribed brigands to kill MoggallÄna. They surrounded the Elderâ€™s cell in KÄlasilÄ, 
but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole. On six 
successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, 
crushing his bones and leaving him for dead. Having recovered consciousness, 
with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take 
his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds. This sad death 
is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth. 
Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a 
forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them 
to death. For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his 
last birth lost his life by violence.</p>
<p>The account in DhA.iii.65ff. differs in several details. 
The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the 
story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to 
the supposed thieves to spare their son. MoggallÄna, very touched by this, did 
not kill them. Before passing into NibbÄna, he preached to the Buddha, at his 
request, and performed many miracles, returning to KÄlasilÄ to die. According to 
the JÄtaka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha 
had the relics collected and a ThÅ«pa erected in Veluvana.</p>
<p>MoggallÄnaâ€™s body was of the colour of the blue lotus or 
the rain cloud (Bu.i.58). There exists in Ceylon an oral tradition that this 
colour is due to his having suffered in hell in the recent past!</p>
