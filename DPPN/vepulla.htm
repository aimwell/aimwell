  <h2>Vepulla, Vipula</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The highest of the five mountains surrounding <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> (S.i.67).  </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, the mountain was called Pācīnavamsa</li>
  <li>in the time of Konāgamana, Vankaka</li>
  <li>while in that of Kassapa Buddha, it was Supassa</li>
</ul>
<p>The people living near it were called, respectively, Tivaras, 
Rohitassas and Suppiyas. The mountain has diminished in size, for the Tivaras, 
who lived for forty thousand years, took four days to climb it and four to 
descend; the Rohitassas lived for thirty thousand years and took three days each 
way; while the Suppiyas, with a life span of twenty thousand years, did the 
journey there and back in four days. In the present age, the Magadhans, who 
lived for about one hundred years, could both climb and descend the mountain in 
very little time (S.ii.190f).</p>
<p>Vepulla was the abode of the Yakkha Kumbhīra and his one 
hundred thousand followers (D.ii.257).  </p>
<p>According to the <a href="dummedha_jat_50_122.htm" title="d/dummedha_jat_50_122.htm">Dummedha Jātaka</a> 
(J.i.445) it was possible for an elephant to climb to the top of Vepulla. From 
Vepulla, the <a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a> gets his 
<a href="cakkaratana.htm" title="c/cakkaratana.htm">cakka ratana</a> (KhpA.p.173; J.iv.232), and it was 
this gem which Punnaka obtained from the mountain to be offered as stake in his 
game of dice with <a href="dhananjaya.htm" title="d/dhananjaya.htm">Dhanañjaya Koravya</a>. J.vi.271, 272, 326.</p>
