<p>A river to the south of Anurādhapura. On 
its banks, King Cūlabhaya built the Cūlagallaka-Vihāra (Mhv.xxxv.13), and 
Vankanāsika-Tissa, the Mahāmangala-Vihāra (Mhv.v.113). Once, when Dhātusena was 
fleeing from his enemies with a thera, his uncle, the river was found to be in 
flood, but a nāga king took them across (Cv.xxxviii.24). Later, when building 
the Kālavāpi, Dhātusena dammed up the river. Cv.v.42. </p>
<p>It is identified with the modern 
Kalā-oya (Cv. Trs.i.30, n.3).3.</p>
