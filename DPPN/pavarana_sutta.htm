<p>The Buddha was once staying at the Migāramātupāsāda, and 
on the day of the pavārana he summoned the five hundred arahants who were with 
him and asked if they had any fault to find with him.  </p>
<p>Sāriputta, speaking for 
them, uttered the Buddha’s praises, and the Buddha, in his turn, spoke of 
Sāriputta’s greatness and of the blamelessness of the arahants. Thereupon
<a href="vangiisa_thera.htm" title="va/vangiisa_thera.htm">Vangīsa</a>, also present, extolled the Buddha in verse. S.i.190f.; also 
Thag.vs.1234ff.</p>
