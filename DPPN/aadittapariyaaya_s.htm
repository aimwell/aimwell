  <h2>Ādittapariyāya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the discourse preached 
by the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at <a href="gayaasiisa.htm" title="g/gayaasiisa.htm">Gayāsīsa</a> in 
<a href="gayaa.htm" title="g/gayaa.htm">Gayā</a>, after his conversion of the 
<a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Tebhātikajatilā</a> 
(Uruvela Kassapa, Nadī Kassapa and Gayā Kassapa).</p>
<p>Everything is burning: the eye, the 
eye-consciousness (cakkhuviññāna), and the contact of the eye with objects (cakkhu-samphassa), 
and the sensations that arise there form. It is the same with the other senses: 
they are aflame with lust, anger, ignorance and the anxieties of birth, decay, 
death, etc.; knowing this, the follower of the Noble Eightfold Path feels 
revulsion towards them and divests himself of passion for them and ultimately 
attains supreme freedom.</p>
<p>At the end of the discourse the thousand 
monks, erstwhile jatilas, who had been listening, became arahants (Vin.i.34-5; 
J.i.82; iv.180).</p>
<p>It is said that the Adittapariyāya was 
preached on the Pitthipāsāna at <a href="gayaasiisa.htm" title="g/gayaasiisa.htm">Gayāsīsa</a> (AA.i.166; ThagA.i.435). This is the 
third recorded address of the Buddha. </p>
<p>It is also called the Āditta Sutta. (See 
<a href="aaditta_sutta.htm" title="aa/aaditta_sutta.htm">Āditta Sutta 3</a>).</p>
