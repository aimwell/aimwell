  <h2>Veluka Jātaka (No. 43)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once at the head of five hundred 
hermits, one of whom had a pet viper which was called Veluka, because it was 
kept in a bamboo. The Bodhisatta warned the ascetic against the snake, but his 
warning was unheeded. The hermit thus came to be called Velukapitā. One day the 
hermits went into the forest and were away for a few days, and when Velukapitā 
touched the viper on his return, the animal, hungry and angry, bit him, and he 
fell down dead. The story was told in reference to a headstrong monk who is 
identified with Velukapitā. J.i.245f.</p>
