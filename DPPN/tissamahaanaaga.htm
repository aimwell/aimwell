<h2>Tissamahānāga Thera</h2>
<p>A monk of Kutumbiya Vihāra. Having heard 
the Satipatthāna Sutta from Tissa Thera of Ambalena, he was on his way back when 
he met a wild elephant. By his virtue the elephant was subdued and Tissamahānāga 
took shelter from a storm under the elephant’s body. There he developed 
arahantship. He then went to Viyolaka-Vihāra with the elephant, and for thirty 
years the animal waited on him. </p>
<p>After death the monk’s remains were 
cremated at Kutumbiya Vihāra, and the elephant participated in the celebrations.
