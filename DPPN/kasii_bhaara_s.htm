  <h2>Kasī Bhāradvāja Sutta</h2>

<p>The Buddhist Parable of the Sower, 
forming the fourth sutta of the Uraga Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta. (Pp.12ff; also 
found in the Samyutta i.171ff under the name of Kasī-Sutta and included in the 
Paritta). It contains the story of the Buddha’s visit to Kasī-Bhāradvāja given 
above. The Buddha tells him that in his work as a Teacher are to be found all 
the elements of a farmer’s duties: faith is the seed, insight the plough, 
mindfulness the ploughshare and goad, energy the burden-bearing team. The 
harvest produced by the sowing is nibbāna and the food ambrosia, free from 
suffering and sorrow.</p>
