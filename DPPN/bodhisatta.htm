  <h2>Bodhisatta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a being who aspires to Bodhi or 
Enlightenment. The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.427) define the word thus: 
Bodhisatto ti panditasatto bujjhanakasatto; bodhisankhÄtesu vÄ catusu maggesu 
Äsatto laggamÄnaso ti Bodhisatto. See also AA.i.453. For a discussion of the 
meaning of the word see Har Dayal: The Bodhisativa Doctrine, pp.4ff. </p>
<p>The word can therefore be used in reference to all those 
who seek NibbÄna, including Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and the disciples of 
Buddhas (Buddha-paccekabuddha-buddha-sÄvakÄ), but is commonly used only of those 
beings who seek to become Buddhas. The word may have been used originally only 
in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as â€œin the days 
before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisattaâ€. E.g., M.i.17, 
114, 163; so also in the MahÄpadÄna Sutta (D.ii.13) and the 
Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119). </p>
<p>But already in the KathÄvatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the 
previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest 
and speculation.</p>
<p>In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, 
a Bodhisattaâ€™s career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhinÄ«hÄrakarana 
or mÅ«lapanidhÄna) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all 
creatures. In later literature, the abhinÄ«hÄra is preceded by a period during 
which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to 
desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.</p>
<p>For the abhinÄ«hÄra to be effective, eight conditions 
should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f. and SNA.i.48f): the 
aspirant should be </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) a human being, </li>
  <li>(2) a male, </li>
  <li>(3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that 
  very birth, </li>
  <li>(4) a recluse at the time of the declaration, 
  </li>
  <li>(5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha,
  </li>
  <li>(6) should be possessed of attainments such as the 
  jhÄnas, </li>
  <li>(7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and 
  </li>
  <li>(8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and 
  unwavering. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhinÄ«hÄra was made at 
AmaravÄtÄ« in the presence of DÄ«pankara Buddha. His name at that time was Sumedha 
(q.v.). The Buddha, before whom the abhinÄ«hÄra is made, looks into the future 
and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the 
particulars of such fulfilment. This declaration is called vyÄkarana, and is 
made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his 
career. Having received his first vyÄkarana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to 
investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of 
Buddhahood (buddhakÄrakadhammÄ), in accordance with the custom of previous 
Bodhisattas. These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasapÄrami):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>dÄna, </li>
  <li>sÄ«la, </li>
  <li>nekkhamma, </li>
  <li>paÃ±Ã±Ä, </li>
  <li>viriya, </li>
  <li>khanti, </li>
  <li>sacca, </li>
  <li>aditthÄna, </li>
  <li>mettÄ and </li>
  <li>upekhÄ. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bu.ii.116ff. Sometimes thirty pÄramÄ« are spoken of, each 
of the ten being divided into three, varying in kind and degree. Thus, in the 
case of </p>
<ul>
  <li>dÄna, the dÄnapÄrami consists in giving oneâ€™s limbs,
  </li>
  <li>dÄna upapÄrami in giving away oneâ€™s external 
  possessions and </li>
  <li>dÄnapÄramatthapÄramÄ« in giving oneâ€™s life, this last 
  being the most excellent. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of Gotama Buddha, examples of births in which 
the ten pÄrami were practised to the highest degree are as follows: the EkarÄja, 
KhantivÄdÄ«, CÅ«lla-SankhapÄla, MahÄjanaka, MahÄsutasoma, MÅ«gapakkha, Lomahamsa, 
Sattubhattaka, Sasa, and Sutasoma JÄtakas (BuA. 50; 
J.i.44f). </p>
<p>He also develops the four BuddhabhÅ«mi (catasso 
buddhabhÅ«miyo) â€” </p>
<ul>
  <li>ussÄha, </li>
  <li>ummagga, </li>
  <li>avatthÄna and </li>
  <li>hitacariyÄ â€” 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>explained respectively as zealousness (viriya), wisdom 
(paÃ±Ã±Ä), resolution (adhitthÄna) and compassion (mettÄbhÄvanÄ). </p>
<p>He cultivates the six ajjhÄsayas which conduce to the 
maturing of Enlightenment (bodhiparipÄkiyÄ samvattanti), these six being: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>nekkhammajjhÄsaya, </li>
  <li>pavivekajjhÄsaya, </li>
  <li>alobhajjhÄsaya, </li>
  <li>adosajjhÄsaya, </li>
  <li>amohajjhÄsaya and </li>
  <li>nissaravajjhÄsaya. SNA.i.50</li>
</ul>
<p>A Bodhisatta, during his career, escapes from being born 
in eighteen inauspicious states (atthÄrasa abhabbatthÄnÄni). He is never born 
blind, deaf, insane, slobbery (elamÅ«ga) or crippled, or among savages (milakkkesu), 
in the womb of a slave, or as a heretic. He never changes his sex, is never 
guilty of any of the five Änantarikakammas, and never becomes a leper. If born 
as an animal, he never becomes less than a quail or more than an elephant. He is 
never born either among various classes of petas nor among the KÄlakaÃ±jakas, 
neither in AvÄ«ci nor in the lokantaraka nirayas, neither as MÄra, nor in worlds 
where there is no perception (asaÃ±Ã±ibhava), nor in the SuddhÄvÄsas, nor in the 
ArÅ«pa worlds, nor ever in another CakkavÄla. SNA.i.50 f.</p>
<p>Besides practising the (thirty) pÄrami, all Bodhisattas 
must make the five great sacrifices (mahÄpariccÄgÄ) â€” 
giving up </p>
<ul>
  <li>wife, </li>
  <li>children, </li>
  <li>kingdom, </li>
  <li>life and </li>
  <li>limb (J.vi.552)&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>and must fulfil the three kinds of conduct (cariyÄ) 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ã±ÄtatthacariyÄ, </li>
  <li>lokatthacariyÄ and </li>
  <li>buddhiatthacariyÄ&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>and the seven mahÄdanas as practised by Vessantara, which 
caused the earth to quake seven times. DA.ii.427; DhA.iii.441; the BuA. (116 f.) 
gives a story about Mangala Buddha which corresponds to that of Vessantara in 
regard to Gotama Buddha. See KharadÄthika.</p>
<p>The length of a Bodhisattaâ€™s career varies; some practice 
the pÄramÄ« for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others 
for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others 
for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas. The first of these 
periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel 
in wisdom (paÃ±Ã±Ä). The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddhÄ); and the 
last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) 
(SNA.i.47 f).</p>
<p>In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in 
Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million 
years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span. 
VipassÄ«, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).</p>
<p>As the time for the announcement of their last birth 
approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten 
thousand world systems. The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and 
request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the 
Buddha. The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great 
Investigations (paÃ±camahÄvilokanÄ) regarding time, continent, place of birth, 
his mother and the life span left to her. Buddhas do not appear in the world 
when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one 
hundred. They are born only in JambudÄ«pa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a 
khattiya or brahmin clan. The Bodhisattaâ€™s mother in his last birth must not be 
passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the pÄrami for one 
hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should 
not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception 
of the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the 
Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he 
announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while 
playing. On the day of his conception, the Bodhisattaâ€™s mother takes the vows of 
fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has 
retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, 
bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a 
golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury. As she lies there the 
Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right 
side. The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with 
radiance. Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child. 
Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the 
mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed 
legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436). At the end of 
the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never 
indoors. SuddhÄvÄsa brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in 
a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin 
and present him to his mother. Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous 
otherwise present at birth, two showers of water â€” 
one hot, the other cold â€” fall from the sky and 
bathe mother and child. The child then takes seven strides to the north, 
standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to 
equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this 
is his last birth. (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, 
spoke, in three different births, as soon as born â€” 
as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, 
J.i.53). </p>
<p>Seven days after birth his mother dies. She dies because 
she must bear no other being. The Bodhisattaâ€™s time of conception is so 
calculated that the motherâ€™s destined life span completes itself seven days 
after his birth. From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would 
appear that the age of the Bodhisattaâ€™s mother at the time of his birth is 
between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotthÄsÄ atikkamma 
tatiyekotthÄse).</p>
<p>The Bodhisattaâ€™s last birth is attended by various 
miracles. The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the 
Bodhisattaâ€™s last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be 
associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff. 
</p>
<p>Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the childâ€™s body the 
thirty two marks of a Great Man (mahÄpurisa), (for details of these see 
D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f. The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) 
and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha. His 
father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha, 
brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the 
world. But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of 
the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to 
be found in the life of a Recluse. In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., 
VipassÄ«) these four signs (nimittÄni as they are called) are seen by them at 
different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).</p>
<p>Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in 
the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of 
his sonâ€™s birth. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant 
  (e.g., DÄ«pankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, SikhÄ« and KonÄgamana), 
  </li>
  <li>some on a chariot (e.g., KondaÃ±Ã±a, Revata, Paduma, 
  PiyadassÄ«, and Kakusandha), </li>
  <li>some on a horse (e.g., Mangala, SujÄta, AtthadassÄ«, 
  Tissa, Gotama), and </li>
  <li>some in a palanquin (e.g., AnomadassÄ«, Siddhattha and 
  VessabhÅ«). </li>
  <li>Some, like NÄrada, go on foot, </li>
  <li>while Sobhita, DhammadassÄ« and Kassapa travelled in the 
  palaces of their lay life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the 
austerities, the period of such practices varying. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case of DÄ«pankara, KondaÃ±Ã±a, Sumana, AnomadassÄ«, 
  SujÄta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; </li>
  <li>for Mangala, Sumedha, Tissa and SikhÄ« it was eight;
  </li>
  <li>for Revata seven; </li>
  <li>for PiyadassÄ«, Phussa, VessabhÅ« and KonÄgamana six;
  </li>
  <li>for Sobhita four; </li>
  <li>for Paduma, AtthadassÄ« and VipassÄ« two weeks; 
  </li>
  <li>for NÄrada, Padumuttara, DhammadassÄ« and Kassapa one 
  week; </li>
  <li>and for Gotama six years (for the reason for this great 
  length in the last case, see Gotama). </li>
</ul>
<p>On the day the Bodhisatta attains to Buddhahood, he 
receives a meal of milk rice (pÄyÄsa) from a woman and a gift of kusagrass, 
generally from an Ä€jÄ«vÄ«ka, which he spreads under the Bodhi-tree (the Bodhi tree 
is different for each Bodhisatta) for his seat. The size of this seat varies;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the seats of DÄ«pankara, Revata, PiyadassÄ«, AtthadassÄ«, 
  DhammadassÄ« and VipassÄ« were fifty-three hands in 
  length; </li>
  <li>those of KondaÃ±Ã±a, Mangala, NÄrada and Sumedha fifty 
  seven hands; </li>
  <li>that of Sumana sixty hands; </li>
  <li>those of Sobhita, AnomadassÄ«, Paduma, Padumuttara and 
  Phussa thirty eight; </li>
  <li>of SujÄta thirty two; </li>
  <li>of Kakusandha twenty six; </li>
  <li>of KonÄgamana twenty; </li>
  <li>of Kassapa fifteen; </li>
  <li>of Gotama fourteen (BuA. 247). </li>
</ul>
<p>Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great 
dreams: </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) that the world is his couch with the HimÄlaya as 
  his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the 
  western, and his feet on the southern; </li>
  <li>(2) that a blade of tiriyÄ(kusa) grass growing from his 
  navel touches the clouds; </li>
  <li>(3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his 
  feet, covering his knees; </li>
  <li>(4) that four birds of varied hues from the four 
  quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; </li>
  <li>(5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by 
  which he remains unsoiled. </li>
</ul>
<p>For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.; 
these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.</p>
<p>The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat 
facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal. The gods 
of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but MÄra (q.v.) comes with his 
mighty hosts and the gods flee. All day, the fight continues between MÄra and 
the Bodhisatta; the pÄrami alone are present to lend their aid to the 
Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to 
his great sacrifices, while MÄra and his armies retire discomfited at the hour 
of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory. Meanwhile the 
Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he 
requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine 
eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samuppÄda 
doctrine. Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation 
and twelve times the earth trembles. With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and 
he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his udÄnÄ of victory, while 
the whole world rejoices with him. </p>
<p>For the Paticca-Samuppada see 
D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is 
given. DA.ii.462ff gives similar details regarding VipassÄ«; BuA.248 says it is 
the same for all Bodhisattas.</p>
<p>The above is a brief account, as given in the books, of 
certain features common to all Bodhisattas. In addition to these, particulars of 
the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in 
the Buddhavamsa and the JÄtakatthakathÄ. It has already been stated that each 
Bodhisatta receives the vyÄkarana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama 
was no exception. </p>
<ul>
  <li>He received his first vyÄkarana as the ascetic Sumedha, 
  from DÄ«pankara; </li>
  <li>and then, as a cakkavatti, from KondaÃ±Ã±a; </li>
  <li>as the brahmin Suruci, from Mangala; </li>
  <li>as the NÄga king Atula, from Sumana; </li>
  <li>as the brahmin Atideva, from Revata; </li>
  <li>as the brahmin Ajita, from Sobhita; </li>
  <li>as a yakkha chief, from AnomadassÄ«; </li>
  <li>as a lion, from Paduma; </li>
  <li>as an ascetic (isi) from NÄrada; </li>
  <li>as a governor (MahÄratthiya) Jatila, from Padumuttara;
  </li>
  <li>as the youth Uttara, from Sumedha; </li>
  <li>as a Cakkavatti, from SujÄta; </li>
  <li>as the youth Kassapa, from PiyadassÄ«; </li>
  <li>as the ascetic SusÄ«ma, from AtthadassÄ«; </li>
  <li>as Sakka, from DhammadassÄ«; </li>
  <li>as the ascetic Mangala, from Siddhattha; </li>
  <li>as SujÄta, from Tissa; </li>
  <li>as King VijitÄvÄ«, from Phussa; </li>
  <li>as the NÄga king Atula, from VipassÄ«; </li>
  <li>as King Arindama, from SikhÄ«; </li>
  <li>as King Sudassana, from VessabhÅ«; </li>
  <li>as King Khema, from Kakusandha; </li>
  <li>as King Pabbata, from KonÄgamana; </li>
  <li>and as the youth JotipÄla, from Kassapa.</li>
</ul>

the Bodhisatta (to the births given below and taken from the JÄtakatthakathÄ

<p>The Bodhisatta was born several times in the purgatories 
(Ap.i.299 ff). The wishes of Bodhisattas are generally fulfilled (J.iii.283; 
v.282, 291; vi. 401, 405, etc.), chiefly because of their great wisdom 
(J.iii.282) and zeal (J.iii.425). The wisdom of a Bodhistatta is greater than 
that of a Pacceka Buddha (J.iv.341). </p>
