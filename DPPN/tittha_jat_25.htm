<p>The Bodhisatta was once adviser to the 
king of Benares. One day, another horse was washed in the place reserved for the 
king’s state charger, who, when taken there to bathe, refused to enter. The 
Bodhisatta, divining the reason, directed that the horse should be taken 
elsewhere, and not always bathed in the same spot, adding that a man will tire 
even of the daintiest food, if it never be changed. The Bodhisatta was amply 
rewarded for his skill in reading the horse’s thoughts. </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk, a disciple of Sāriputta. He had been a goldsmith and the meditation on 
impurity, prescribed for him by Sāriputta, proved impossible for him. He was 
taken to see the Buddha, who asked him to gaze at a lotus in a pond near by. The 
monk saw the lotus fade and, developing insight, became an arahant. He marvelled 
at the Buddha’s power of reading the thoughts and temperaments of others.</p>
<p>The monk is identified with the state 
charger and Ānanda with the king. J.i.182ff</p>
