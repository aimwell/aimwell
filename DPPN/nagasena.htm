<h4>1. Nāgasena Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant, celebrated for his discussions with King 
<a href="milinda.htm" title="me_mu/milinda.htm">Milinda</a>. He was the son of the Brahmin Sonuttara, in the village of Kajangala in 
the Himālaya.  </p>
<p>He was well versed in the Vedas, and entered the Order under 
<a href="rohana.htm" title="r/rohana.htm">Rohana</a> to learn the Buddha’s teaching. Later he went to Assagutta of the 
Vattaniya senāsana and studied under him. There, one day, at the conclusion of a 
meal, while giving thanks to a lay woman who had looked after Assagutta for more 
than thirty years, Nāgasena became a Sotāpanna. Then he was sent to Pātaliputta, 
where he studied under Dhammarakkhita, and there he attained arahantship. 
Subsequently he went to the Sankheyya parivena in <a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sagala</a>, where he met Milinda. 
 
</p>
<p>It is said that in his previous birth he was a deva, named Mahāsena, living in 
Tāvatimsa, in a palace called Ketumatī, and that he consented to be born among 
men at the insistent request of Sakka and the arahants led by Assagutta.  </p>
<p>In an 
earlier life he had made an aspiration to be able to defeat Milinda in 
discussion.  </p>
