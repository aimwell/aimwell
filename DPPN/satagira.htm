<p>A Yakkha. He and his friend, <a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a>, were two of the 
twenty eight leaders of the Yakkhas. They had both been monks in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha, but had been guilty of deciding wrongly in the dispute which 
arose between <a href="dhammavaadi.htm" title="d/dhammavaadi.htm">Dhammavādī</a> and 
<a href="adhammavaadi.htm" title="am/adhammavaadi.htm">Adhammavādī</a>, hence their birth as Yakkhas, Sātāgira in Sātapabbata, and Hemavata in Himavā. They recognized each other at 
the Yakkha assembly in the Bhagalavatī pabbata, and promised to inform each 
other if, in their lives, they came across anything of interest.</p>
<p>When the Buddha was born and when he preached his first 
sermon, Sātāgira was present in the assembly, but, because he was constantly 
looking about to see if Hemavata was there, he could not concentrate his mind on 
the Buddha’s teaching. When the sun set and the Buddha was still preaching, he 
went with five hundred of his followers to fetch Hemavata. At Rājagaha they met 
Hemavata, who was on the way to invite Sātāgira to Himavā, which was covered 
with such flowers as had never before been seen. Sātāgira explains that the 
reason for this miracle is the appearance of the Buddha in the world, and, in 
answer to Hemavata’s questions, declares the greatness of the Buddha.  </p>
<p>Their 
conversation is found in the introductory gāthā of the Hemavata Sutta (q.v.). 
Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.199) that, according to some, this meeting took place, 
not on the occasion of the first sermon, but later, when the Buddha was living 
in the Gotāmaka cetiya. <a href="kaalii.htm" title="ka/kaalii.htm">Kāli Kuraragharikā</a>, as she sat by her window 
cooling herself, heard the conversation of the two Yakkhas, and her mind being 
filed with devotion to the Buddha, as she heard his wonderful qualities being 
enumerated she attained sotāpatti.</p>
<p>When Hemavata is satisfied, from Sātāgira’s description, 
that the Buddha is really the Awakened One, he decides to go to him with 
Sātagira. Together they go with their followers to Isipatana in the middle watch 
of the night, and Hemavata questions the Buddha about his teaching. Hemavata is, 
by nature, powerful and wise and filled with respect for the good, and the 
Buddha’s marvellous exposition of the dhamma fills him with great joy. He sings 
the Buddha’s praises in five stanzas, and, after taking leave of him and of 
Sātāgira, returns home with the promise that he will wander from place to place 
carrying the joyful news of the Buddha and his Dhamma among all beings. This 
story is given in the Commentary to the Hemavata Sutta; SNA.i.194 216; cf. 
AA.i.134f.</p>
<p>Later, when journeying through the air in various 
conveyances, on their way to the Yakkha assembly, Sātāgira and Hemavata and 
their followers were about to pass over <a href="aalavaka.htm" title="aa/aalavaka.htm">Alavaka’s</a> hermitage; but because the 
Buddha was then inside, the Yakkhas found that their conveyances remained 
stationary as no one could pass over the head of the Buddha. When they thus 
discovered his presence, they alighted and made obeisance to the Buddha, and 
congratulated Alavaka on his extreme good fortune in having an opportunity of 
meeting and listening to the Buddha. AA.i.221; a similar story is related 
(UdA.64) about them when they passed the abode of the Yakkha Ajakalāpaka.</p>
<p>Sātāgira is mentioned in the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.204) 
as one of the Yakkhas to be invoked in time of need by the Buddha’s followers. 
He is identified with the Yakkha of the Bhisa Jātaka. J.iv.314.</p>
