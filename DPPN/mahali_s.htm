<h2>Mahāli Sutta</h2>
<p><b>1. Mahāli Sutta. </b>The Licchavi Otthaddha (Mahāli) 
visits the Buddha at the Kutāgārasālā and reports to him a conversation he had 
had with Sunakkhatta, who claimed to be able to see heavenly forms but not to 
hear heavenly sounds. Mahāli inquires how such a faculty can be acquired, and 
the Buddha tells him, but explains that it is not for the sake of acquiring 
these powers that people join the Order. Asking what then is their object, he 
gradually leads the conversation on to the question of arahantship, along the 
Eightfold Path. The Buddha then raises a quite different question, as to whether 
the soul and the body are identical. The discourse on this again leads to the 
question of arahantship (cp. Jāliya Sutta), but it is significant that the 
Buddha leaves this last question unanswered (D.i.150 8).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.316) that the Buddha raised the 
point of body and soul, because he knew that Mahāli harboured the heretical 
belief that a soul exists and that it has form.</p>

<p><b>2. Mahāli Sutta. </b>The Licchavi Mahāli visits the 
Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and questions him regarding the doctrine of Pūrana 
Kassapa that there is no cause or condition for the impurity of beings. The 
Buddha contradicts this view, and explains that it is because beings take 
delight in the body, etc., that they become impure. When they feel revulsion 
towards the body, etc., they become pure. S.iii.68f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahāli Sutta. </b>The Buddha, in answer to a 
question of Mahāli, says that greed, ill will, dullness cause the continuance of 
evil action, and right reflection and a well poised mind cause the continuance 
of good. The existence of these two different sets of qualities cause the good 
and evil in the world. A.v.86f.</p>
