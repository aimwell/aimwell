<p>A co-resident of Sāriputta. He evidently 
understood medicine, and one day he administered medical treatment for a sick 
person, in return for which he received a portion of choice food. As he went out 
he met an Elder on the road to whom he offered it, telling him the circumstances 
in which it was obtained and offering to bring him in the future the food so 
obtained. The Elder listened, then walked away without a word. When the Buddha 
heard of this, he declared that a shameless man can, in a manner of speaking, 
live happily, like a crow. Dh A.iii.351f.</p>
