  <h2>Kuru</h2>

</ul>
<p>A country, one of the sixteen 
Mahājanapadas (D.ii.200; A.i.213 etc.). Frequent references to it are found in 
the Pāli Canon. It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (rājakumārā) 
of the country and that their territory was later named after them. Buddhaghosa 
records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandhātā 
returned to Jambudīpa from his sojourn in the four Mahādīpas and in the 
devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru. 
They settled down in Jambudīpa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha. It 
had many towns and villages.</p>
<p>The country seems to have had very 
little political influence in the Buddha’s time, though, in the past, Pañcāla, 
Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., 
J.ii.214). According to the Jātakas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; 
ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its 
capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference. The ruling dynasty at 
Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361). Among the kings 
of the past, Dhanañjaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; 
iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya 
(J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the Bodhisatta Sutasoma. During the Buddha’s 
time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with 
the Elder Ratthapāla, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, 
is recounted in the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65ff). Perhaps at one time the Kuru 
kingdom extended as far as Uttarapañcāla, for in the Somanassa Jātaka 
(J.iv.444), Uttarapañcāla is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as 
its king.</p>
<p>Koravya had a park called Migācīra where 
Ratthapāla took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725). The 
people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this 
reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed 
to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma Jātaka) as the reason for the Buddha having 
delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the 
Mahānidāna, and the Mahāsatipatthāna Suttas. Among other discourses delivered in 
the Kuru country are the Māgandiya Sutta, the Anañjasappāya Sutta, the Sammosa 
Sutta and the Ariyavasā Sutta. All these were preached at Kammāssadhamma, which 
is described as a nigama of the Kurūs, where the Buddha resided from time to 
time. Another town of the Kurūs, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the 
birthplace of Ratthapāla, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; 
ThagA.ii.30). Udena’s queen, Māgandiyā, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and 
Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and 
Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms 
(DhA.iii.242).</p>
<p>The Kuru country is generally identified 
as the district around Thānesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern 
Delhi (CAGI.379f). See also Uttarakuru.</p>
