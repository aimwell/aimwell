<p>An arahant, mother of Vaddha Thera.  </p>
<p>After the birth of <a href="vaddha.htm" title="va/vaddha.htm">Vaddha</a> she heard a monk preach, joined the Order, and became an arahant. 
She rebuked Vaddha when he visited her alone and without his cloak, and, later, 
when he asked for her advice, gave it to him and encouraged him. Then Vaddha 
developed insight and became an arahant. ThigA.171f.; her conversation with 
Vaddha and his declaration to her after becoming an arahant are included in the 
Thig.vs.204-12.</p>
