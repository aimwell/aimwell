  <h2>Sāketa-pañha</h2>

<p>The Atthasālinī (DhSA.267) mentions that once the Elder 
Tipitaka Mahādhammarakkhita, in talking of consciousness, referred to the 
Saketapañha.  </p>
<p>It is said that in Sāketa the monks raised the query, “When by one 
volition kamma is put forth, is there one conception only, or different 
conceptions?” Unable to decide, they consulted the Abhidhamma Elders, who 
declared that just as from one mango only one sprout puts forth, so by one 
volition there is only one conception, and for different volitions, different 
conceptions.</p>
