<p>On the five controlling faculties (indriyāni) 
- of discomfort, of unhappiness, of ease, of happiness and of indifference — and 
on how they are conditioned and how they cease to be (S.v.213f). According to 
the Commentary (SA.iii.192), the title of this sutta should be Uppatipātika 
Sutta (the sutta which deals with reference to what has gone before).</p>
