<p>The name given to <a href="vijaya.htm" title="vy/vijaya.htm">Vijaya</a> and his companions, founders of 
the Sinhalese race in Ceylon. </p>
<p>It is said (Mhv.vii.42; cf. Dpv.ix.1) that Sīhala was the 
name given to Sīhabāhu because he had killed the lion (sīham adinnavā iti), and 
because of their connection with him, Vijaya and his companions were also called 
Sīhalā. </p>
<p>The word, thereafter, became the name of the inhabitants 
of Ceylon, as opposed to the <a href="damila.htm" title="d/damila.htm">Damilas</a> and others.</p>
<p>The Sīhalā had a vīnā with very fine strings. KhA.47.</p>
