<p>An eminent lay disciple, declared by the Buddha foremost 
among his followers in unwavering loyalty (agggam aveccappasannānam) (A.i.26; 
cf.iii.451). He resolved to acquire this eminence during his birth in the time 
of Padumuttara Buddha. He was born, in this Buddha age, in a banker’s family in 
Sāvatthi and became a follower of the heretics. One day the Buddha, seeing 
Sūra’s fitness for conversion, went to his door for alms. Out of respect for the 
Buddha, Sūra invited him in, and, giving him a comfortable seat, entertained him 
to a meal. At the end of the meal, when the Buddha returned thanks, Sūra became 
a sotāpanna. Some time after the Buddha had left, Māra, disguised as the Buddha, 
visited Sūra and, in reply to Sūra’s questioning, said that he had returned to 
contradict a wrong statement which he had made earlier. He had said that all the 
sankhāras were impermanent, etc., but, on further reflection, he had come to the 
conclusion that only some sankhāras were of that nature. Sūra recognized Māra 
and drove him away. AA.i.215; cf. DA.iii.864.</p>
