<p>The name <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> bore in a previous birth when he was born 
as a man in Macalagāma in Magadha. </p>
<p>The usual form of the name is a derivative&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
e.g., J.vi.212; he is often called Maghavā Sujampati <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
e.g., J.iii.146; iv.403; v.137, 139; vi.102, 481, 573; or Maghavā Sakko 
<span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; e.g., J.v.141; see also 
Mtu.i.165, 167 (sahasranetro Maghavān va sobhase) and Mtu.iii.366 (Sakro āha: 
Maghavān ti me āhu syaloke).</p>
<p>His story is given in the 
<a href="kulaavaka_jat_31.htm" title="ku/kulaavaka_jat_31.htm">Kulāvaka Jātaka</a>. For a 
slightly different version see DhA.i.264ff. Because of his birth as Magha, Sakka 
came to be known as Maghavā. Maghavā was, perhaps, not the personal name of any 
particular Sakka, but a title of all Sakkas, because the Sakka who was the real 
Magha is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.i.207), while the Buddha says 
(S.i.231; DhA.i.264) that the Sakka, who visited him, and whose conversation is 
recorded in the <a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a>, was also known as Maghavā. The title probably 
originated from the time when Magha became Sakka.</p>
<p>The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.267; this is supported by 
the story as given in DA.iii.710 ff. and DhA.i.264ff., where no mention is made 
of the Bodhisatta), however, says that Magha was not the Bodhistatta, but that 
his life was like that of a Bodhisatta (Bodhisattacariyā viyassa cariyā ahosi); 
in which case the name Maghavā belongs only to the present Sakka. Magha took 
upon himself seven vows (vatapadāni), which brought him birth as Sakka: to 
maintain his parents, to revere his elders, to use gentle language, to utter no 
slander, to be free from avarice, to practise generosity and open handed 
liberality and kindness, to speak the truth, to be free from anger (S.i.227f.; 
SA.i.267).</p>
