<p><b>1. Brāhmana Sutta.</b> Ānanda sees, on his begging 
round, Jānussoni’s white chariot, drawn by four white mares, the people crowding 
round it and declaring it the best and most beautiful of chariots. He goes to 
the Buddha and asks him if such a description could be used of the Buddha. The 
Buddha says that the Noble Eightfold Way can be so described. S.v.4f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Brāhmana Sutta.</b> A brahmin visits the Buddha at 
Jetavana and asks why it is that the Buddha’s Doctrine will disappear soon after 
his death. The Buddha says it is because of the failure of men to realize the 
four satipatthānas. S.v.174.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Brāhmana Sutta.</b> The brahmin Unnābha visits 
Ānanda at the Ghositārāma and questions him. Ānanda tells him that the life of a 
recluse has for its object the abandonment of desire and that this is brought 
about by the cultivation of the four iddhi<span lang="en-us">-pādas. 
That would be a task without end, says Unnābha; but Ānanda proves to him that 
once the purpose is accomplished, there remains nothing more to do. Unnābha 
accepts Ānanda  as his teacher. S.v.271f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Brāhmana Sutta</b>. The Buddha explains to the monks 
how the teachings of the brahmins differ from his on the practice leading to 
prosperity. S.v.361.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Brāhmana Sutta</b>. The Buddha explains, in answer 
to the question of a brahmin, how the Dhamma can be described as sanditthika. 
A.i.156.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Brāhmana Sutta. </b>Two 
brahmins, skilled in lokāyata, visit the Buddha and say that, according to 
Pūrana Kassapa, the world is finite, while, according to Nigantha Nātaputta, it 
is infinite, and that both teachers claim omniscience. How can one know which 
teaching is true? The Buddha dismisses their question and teaches them that it 
is not by trying to walk to the end of the world that the end of the world can 
be reached, but by understanding the five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguna). 
This can be accomplished by the cultivation of the jhānas. A.iv.428f.</p>
