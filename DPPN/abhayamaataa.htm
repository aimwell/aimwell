<p>A Therī. She was a courtesan named 
Padumavatī, the belle of Ujjenī. King Bimbisāra, having heard of her beauty, 
expressed to his purohita a wish to see her. The purohita, by the power of his 
spells, enlisted the assistance of a Yakkha, Kumbhīra, who took the king to 
Ujjeni. </p>
<p>She bore to the king a son, 
Abhayarājakumāra, who later joined the Order and became an arahant. It was on 
his account that Padumavatī came to be called Abhayamātā. She heard 
Abhayarājakumāra preach and leaving the world herself became an arahant 
(ThigA.31-2). </p>
<p>Two verses attributed to her are found 
in the Therigatha (33,34). </p>
<p>In the time of the Buddha Tissa, seeing 
him going round for alms, with glad heart she gave him a spoonful of food. As a 
result, she was thirty-six times queen among the gods and was chief queen of 
fifty cakkavattis (ThigA.32). </p>
<p>She is evidently identical with 
Katacchubhikkhadāyikā of the Apadāna (ii.516-7).</p>
