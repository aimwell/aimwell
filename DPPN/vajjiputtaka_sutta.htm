<p>A Vajjian monk visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in 
Vesāli, and complains that he has to recite over two hundred and fifty rules 
twice a month. “I cannot stand such training,” he says. The Buddha then asks him 
if he can train himself in three particulars. The monk agrees to do this and is 
told to develop higher morality, the higher thought and higher insight (adhisīla, 
adhicitta, adhipaññā). The monk develops these, and, as a result, gets rid of 
lust, malice, and delusion. A.i.230f.</p>
