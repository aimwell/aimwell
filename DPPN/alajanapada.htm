<p>A district which the thera Isidatta visited on his return journey from a pilgrimage to the 
  Mahā-Vihāra. </p>
<p>The children of Alajanapada collected some fruit-rinds, which had 
  been left behind by the fruit-gatherers, and gave them to Isidatta and his 
  companion, Mahāsona. </p>
<p>It is said that this was the only meal they had for a week. VibhA.447.</p>
