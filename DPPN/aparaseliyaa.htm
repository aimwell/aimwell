<p>A sub-sect of the Andhakā. Their beliefs 
seem to have been similar to those of the Pubbaseliyā. KvuA. quoted in Points of 
Controversy, pp. 5 and 104. See also Dpv.v.54; Mhv.v.12; Mbv.97. For their 
beliefs see de la Vallee Poussin: J.R.A.S., April, 1910, pp.413ff. </p>
<p>Their centre was Dhanakataka, in the 
Andhaka country, somewhere near Kañcipura and Amarāvati on the S.E. coast of 
India (Points of Controversy, xliii; see also Watters: On Yuan Chwang, 
ii.214ff). </p>
<p>According to one tradition they were 
connected with the Cetiyavādins. For a discussion of this see Points of 
Controversy, xliii-iv.</p>
