<p>A goddess (devadhītā). </p>
<p>She had a palace in the Cātummahārājika world which Nimi 
saw on his visit to heaven when he learnt her story from Mātali. In the time of 
Kassapa Buddha she had been a slave in a brahmin’s house. The brahmin, whose 
name was Asoka, invited eight monks to feed daily at his house and asked his 
wife to arrange to feed them at a cost of one kahāpana each. This she refused to 
do as did also his daughters; but their slave agreed to carry out this work, and 
she did it most conscientiously and with great devotion. As a result she was 
reborn in heaven (J.vi.117f). Her palace was twelve leagues in height and one in 
extent; it possessed nine storeys and one thousand rooms. When Dutthagāmanī 
wished to erect the Lohapāsāda, he asked the monks for a plan, and eight 
arahants went to the deva world and returned with a plan of Bīranī’s palace.
