<p>So called because he was always sweeping. One day he saw 
Revata in his cell and thought him an idler. Revata read his thoughts, and, 
wishing to admonish him, asked him to return after a bath. When Sammuñjanī did 
so, Revata preached to him on the duties of a monk. Sammuñjanī became an 
arahant, and all the rooms remained unswept. The monks, reported this to the 
Buddha, who, however, declared him free from blame, since there was no need for 
him to continue sweeping. DhA.iii.168 f.</p>
