  <h2>Girimānanda Thera</h2>

<p>He was the son of King Bimbisāra’s 
chaplain and, having seen the might of the Buddha when the Buddha entered 
Rājagaha, joined the Order. He lived in a village studying, but one day, when he 
came to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha, the king asked him to remain, promising to 
look after him. The king, however, forgot his promise, and Girimānanda had to 
live in the open. The gods, fearing to wet him, stopped rain from falling. The 
king, observing the drought and discovering the reason for it, built him a 
hermitage wherein the Thera put forth effort and became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a 
householder, and when his wife and children died he fled into the forest in 
grief. There the Buddha consoled him, and he offered flowers to the Buddha and 
sang his praises (Thag.vv.325-9; ThagA.i.409ff; Ap.i.330f).</p>
<p>The Giri Sutta was preached in reference 
to Girimānanda, when he lay grievously ill. A.v.108ff.</p>
