<p>A country in which was the port of Suppāraka, birthplace 
of Punna Thera. From there he went with a caravan to Sāvatthi, and, after 
hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. Later, obtaining the Buddha’s 
permission, he returned to Sunāparanta (ThagA.i.158). There he attained 
arahantship, and five hundred men and five hundred women became lay followers of 
the religion. Under his direction they built a Gandhakuti, called Candanasālā, 
and Punna, wishing the Buddha to be present at the dedication festival, sent a 
flower through the air to the Buddha at Sāvatthi as invitation.</p>
<p>The Buddha accepted this invitation and went to 
Sunāparanta with four hundred and ninety nine arahants, including Kundadhāna and 
Ānanda, all in pinnacled palanquins, provided by Vissakamma, acting under orders 
from Sakka. On the way the Buddha stopped at Saccabaddhapabbata, where he 
converted the tāpasa of the mountain, who became an arahant and travelled on 
with the party in the five hundredth palanquin. The Buddha spent the day in 
Sunāparanta, and, on his way back, stopped on the banks of the river Nammadā. 
There the Nāgarājā paid him homage, and the Buddha left his footprint in the 
Nāga’s abode for him to worship. MA.ii.101f.; SA.iii.176; according to the 
latter account the Buddha spent seven days in Sunāparanta, at the Mankulārāma.</p>
<p>The people of Sunāparanta were reported as being fierce 
and violent (M.iii.268; S.iv.61f).</p>
<p>Sunāparanta was also the birthplace of Culla-Punna and 
Isidinna (Isidatta) (q.v.).</p>
<p>Sunāparanta is probably identical with Aparanta; the 
Burmese, however, identify it with the country on the right bank of the 
Irrawaddy River, near Pagan. Sās. Introd., p.ix.</p>
