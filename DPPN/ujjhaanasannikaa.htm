<p>The name given to a group of devas who 
once visited the Buddha at Jetavana late at night. They charged the Buddha with 
inconsistency, but later, begging his forgiveness, they were pardoned by him 
(S.i.23-5). Buddhaghosa (SA.i.50f ) says that they did not belong to any 
separate deva-world but were given this name by the Theras of the Council on 
account of their captious remarks. They had heard the Buddha praise his monks 
for self-denying practices while he himself wore raiment of silk, fine cloth or 
linen, ate food worthy of a rājā, dwelt in a Fragrant Cell like unto a 
deva-mansion and used good medicines.</p>
