<p><b>1. Jotipāla.</b>-The Bodhisatta born as the 
son of the chaplain of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was a great archer and 
became an ascetic. He is also referred to as Sarabhanga (J.v.127ff).  </p>
<p>For his 
story see the <a href="sarabhanga_jat_522.htm" title="sa/sarabhanga_jat_522.htm">Sarabhanga Jātaka</a>. He is evidently identical with Jotipāla of the 
<a href="indriya_jat_423.htm" title="i_/indriya_jat_423.htm">Indriya Jātaka</a>. He belonged to the Kondaññagotta. J.v.140, 141, 142.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Jotipāla.</b>-The Bodhisatta born as a brahmin of Vehalinga in the time of <a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddha.
<a href="ghatiikaara.htm" title="g/ghatiikaara.htm">Ghatīkāra</a> was his friend and 
invited Jotipāla to accompany him to the Buddha, but Jotipāla refused to go, 
saying that a “shaveling recluse” could be of no use to him. But Ghatīkāra was 
very insistent, and one day, after they had bathed together in the river, seized 
Jotipāla by the hair and made a final appeal. This boldness on the part of an 
inferior (Ghatīkāra was a potter) caused Jotipāla to realise his extreme 
earnestness and he agreed to go. After hearing the Buddha preach, Jotipāla 
became a monk (M.ii.46ff; J.i.43; Bu.xxv.10; see also S.i.34f; Mil.221; 
Mtu.i.319ff).</p>
<p>This insulting remark made by Jotipāla 
regarding Kassapa Buddha led to Gotama, in his last life, having to practise 
austerities for a longer period than did the other Buddhas (Ap.i.301; UdA.265; 
ApA.i.95). The memory of what he did as Jotipāla was one of the things that made 
the Buddha smile. DhsA.294, 496.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Jotipāla.</b>-A brahmin, son of Govinda, 
chaplain of Disampati. Jotipāla was a friend of Disampati’s son, Renu, who had 
six other nobles as companions. On the death of Govinda, Jotipāla became 
chaplain to Disampati. He inspired Renu’s six companions to wait on Renu and 
make him promise to share the kingdom with them when he should come to the 
throne. This promise Renu kept when he succeeded his father and appointed 
Jotipāla to carry out the division of the kingdom, which the latter duly did. 
All the kings wished Jotipāla to be their chaplain, and he instructed them in 
the art of government, teaching the mantras also to seven eminent brahmins and 
to seven hundred young graduates. Jotipāla himself came to be known as Mahā 
Govinda.</p>
<p>After some time, Jotipāla took leave of 
the seven kings, his disciples and his wives, and spent the four months of the 
rainy season in a retired spot outside the city, developing jhāna in order to 
see Brahmā face to face. At the end of the four months, Brahmā Sanankumāra 
appeared before him and gave him a boon. Jotipāla asked to be taught the way to 
reach the Brahma-world, and, having listened to Sanankumāra’s exposition, 
decided to leave the world. The kings and all the others did their best to make 
him desist from this course, but finding their efforts of no avail they went 
with him into the homeless life, where all of them profited thereby.</p>
<p>Jotipāla was the Bodhisatta 
(D.ii.232-51; Mtu.i.197ff). He is twice mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya 
(A.iii.372; iv.135; AA.ii.679) in a list of ancient teachers with very large 
followings.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Jotipāla.</b>-A monk at whose request 
Buddhaghosa wrote the Sāratthappakāsinī and the Manoratthapūranī. He seems to 
have been a colleague of Buddhaghosa and lived with him in several places, 
including Kañcīpura. Gv.68; SA.iii.235; AA.ii.874.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Jotipāla.</b>-A thera of Ceylon. He 
defeated in debate the adherents of the Vetulla school, and one of their angry 
followers, Dāthāpabhuti, raised his hand to strike the Thera. An ulcer 
immediately appeared on Dāthāpabhuti’s hand. Aggabodhi I. gave the Elder a 
dwelling in the vihāra (Abhayagiri?) — where the discussion took place — and 
charged his nephew with his care. The king also built for the Elder the 
Nīlagehapariccheda. Later the Kālinga king came with his family to Ceylon and 
was ordained under Jotipāla. Aggabodhi II. repaired the Thūpārāma at Jotipāla’s 
suggestion and deposited therein a relic of the Buddha from the Lohapāsāda 
(Cv.xlii.35, 45, 51, 60).</p>
