<p><b>1. Ālavaka.</b>-The king of Ālavi. He was in 
the habit of holding a hunt once in seven days to keep his army in trim. One day 
when he was hunting, the quarry escaped from where the king lay in wait and, 
according to custom, it became the king’s duty to capture it. He, therefore, 
followed the animal for three leagues, killed it and, having cut it in half, 
carried it in a pingo. On his way back he happened to pass under the banyan tree 
which was the abode of the Yakkha Ālavaka. The Yakkha had been granted a boon by 
the Yakkha-king, which allowed him to eat anybody who came within the shadow of 
the tree. Accordingly, he seized the king, but later released him on obtaining 
his promise that he would provide him at regular intervals with a human being 
and a bowl of food (SnA.i.217ff).  </p>
<p>For the rest of the story see Ālavaka Yakkha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ālavaka.</b>-The <b>Yakkha</b> referred to 
above.  </p>
<p>King Ālavaka, with the help of the Mayor of the town (Nagaraguttika) and 
his ministers, was able to keep his promise for some time, by sending criminals 
to the Yakkha. The Yakkha’s power was such that at the sight of him men’s bodies 
became as soft as butter. Soon there were no criminals left, and each household 
was forced to contribute one child for sacrifice to the Yakkha.  </p>
<p>Then women, 
about to bring forth children, began to leave the king’s capital. Twelve years 
passed in this manner and the only child left was the king’s own son, Ālavaka 
Kumāra. When the king learnt this, he ordered the child to be dressed in all 
splendour and taken to the Yakkha. The Buddha, with his Eye of Compassion, saw 
what was going to happen and went to the Yakkha’s abode.</p>
<p>Ālavaka was away at a meeting of the 
Yakkhas in Himavā. His doorkeeper Gadrabha admitted the Buddha, after warning 
him of the Yakkha’s unmannerly nature. The Buddha went in and sat down on 
Ālavaka’s throne while Gadrabha went to Himavā to announce to his master the 
Buddha’s arrival. While the Buddha was there, preaching to Ālavaka’s women-folk, 
the Yakkhas <a href="satagira.htm" title="sa/satagira.htm">Sātāgira</a> and 
<a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a>, passing through the air on their way to the 
assembly in Himavā, being made aware of the Buddha’s presence by their inability 
to fly over him, descended to Ālavaka’s palace and made obeisance to the Buddha 
before resuming their journey.</p>
<p>When Ālavaka heard from Gadrabha and 
from Sātāgira and Hemavata of the Buddha’s visit, he was greatly incensed and 
uttering aloud his name, he hurried to his abode. There with all the various 
supernatural powers he could command he tried to dislodge the Buddha from his 
seat, but without success even his special weapon, the Dussāvudha being of no 
avail against the Buddha. Then, approaching the Buddha, Ālavaka asked him to 
leave his house, which the Buddha did. He then summoned the Buddha back and he 
came. Three times this happened and three times the Buddha obeyed, judging 
compliance to be the best way of softening his wrath, but the fourth time the 
Buddha refused to return. Thereupon Ālavaka expressed his desire to ask 
questions of the Buddha, hoping thereby to fatigue him. The Buddha agreed, and 
when he had answered all the questions to Ālavaka’s satisfaction, the latter 
became a Sotāpanna (SnA.i.239).</p>
<p>At dawn of day, King Ālavaka’s men 
brought the young prince, Ālavaka-Kumara to the Yakkha, as sacrifice. Hearing 
the Yakkha’s shouts of joy at the close of the Buddha’s sermon, they greatly 
marvelled. When they announced to Ālavaka that they had brought their offering, 
and handed him the child, he was much ashamed because of the Buddha’s presence. 
Ālavaka gave the child to the Buddha, who blessed him and gave him back to the 
king’s messengers. The boy, having passed from the Yakkha’s hands to those of 
the Buddha, and from there to the king’s men, thereafter became known as 
Hatthaka Ālavaka (SnA.i.239-40).</p>
<p>When the king and the citizens heard 
that the Yakkha had become a follower of the Buddha, they built for him a 
special abode near that of Vessavana and provided him with endless gifts of 
flowers, perfumes, etc., for his use. The story of Ālavaka, of which the above 
is a summary, is given in full in SnA.i.217-40 and in SA.i.244-59. It is also 
given in brief in AA.i.211-12 and with some difference in detail. </p>
<p>Ālavaka’s abode was thirty leagues from 
Sāvatthi, and the Buddha covered the whole journey in one day (SnA.i.220). The 
abode was near a banyan tree and on the ground (bhummattham,) well protected 
with walls, etc., and covered on the top by a metal net, it was like a cart 
enclosed on all sides. It was three leagues in extent, and over it lay the road 
to Himavā by air (SnA.i.222). Ascetics, having seen the glittering palace, often 
called to find out what it was. Ālavaka would ask them questions regarding their 
faith, and when they could not answer he would assume a subtle form and, 
entering their hearts, would drive them mad (SnA.i.228).</p>
<p>Ālavaka shouted his name before starting 
from Himavā to vanquish the Buddha. He stood with his left foot on Manosilātala 
and his right on Kelāsakūta. His shout was heard throughout 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a> and was 
one of the four shouts, mentioned in tradition, as having travelled so far 
(SnA.i.223; for the others see <a href="punnaka.htm" title="pu/punnaka.htm">Punnaka</a>, 
<a href="vissakamma.htm" title="vy/vissakamma.htm">Vissakamma</a> and <a href="kusa.htm" title="ku/kusa.htm">Kusā</a>). Ālavaka had a 
special weapon, the Dussāvudha, comparable to Sakka’s Vajirāvudha, Vessavana’s 
Gadāvudha and Yama’s Nayanāvudha. It had the power, if it were thrown into the 
sky, of stopping rain for twelve years and if cast on the earth of destroying 
all trees and crops for a like period. If hurled into the sea it would dry up 
all the water, and it could shatter Sineru into pieces. It was made of cloth and 
is described as a vatthāvudha, and it was worn as a part of the Yakkha’s upper 
garment (uttariya).</p>
<p>There are three salient features in the 
story of Ālavaka which link it closely to the large circle of stories grouped by 
Professor Watanabe (J.P.T.S.1909-10, pp.240ff) under the title of Kalmāsapāda 
stories: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>(1) The man-eating Yakkha; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>(2) the captured king saving himself by 
a promise to provide the Yakkha with offerings, and the sanctity of that 
promise; and </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>(3) the conversion of the Yakkha.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The conversion of Ālavaka is considered 
one of the chief incidents of the Buddha’s life (E.g., J.iv.180; vi.329; 
Mhv.xxx.84).</p>
<p>Ālavaka’s name appears in the Atānātiya 
Sutta, among the Yakkhas to whom followers of the Buddha should appeal for 
protection in time of need (D.iii.205). (See also Ālavaka Sutta.)</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Ālavaka Sutta.</b>-Records the eight 
questions asked of the Buddha by Ālavaka Yakkha and the answers given by the 
Buddha. It is said (SnA.i.228) that Ālavaka’s parents had learnt the questions 
and their answers from Kassapa Buddha and had taught them to Ālavaka in his 
youth; but he could not remember them and, in order that they might be 
preserved, he had them written on a gold leaf with red paint, and this he stored 
away in his palace. When the Buddha answered the questions he found that the 
answers were exactly the same as those given by Kassapa (SnA.i.231). </p>
<p>The sutta appears both in Sutta Nipāta 
(pp.31-3) and in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.213ff). The Ālavaka Sutta is also 
included in the collection of Parittas.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ālavaka Sutta.</b>-A conversation between 
the Buddha and Hatthaka Ālavaka in which the Buddha states that he is among 
those who enjoy real happiness. A.i.136f.</p>
