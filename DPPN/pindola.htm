<h4><b>Pindola</b></h4>
<p>A Pacceka Buddha, given in a nominal list. M.iii.69; 
ApA.i.106.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pindola Sutta</h4>
<p>The Buddha explains to some monks at the Ghositārāma that 
Pindola Bhāradvāja had realized truth through having cultivated three 
controlling faculties: mindfulness, concentration, and insight. These accomplish 
the destruction of birth, old age, and death. S.v.224f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pindola Bhāradvāja</h4>
<p>The son of the chaplain of King <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a> of
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. He 
belonged to the <a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvājagotta</a>. He learnt the Vedas and became a successful 
teacher, but, finding his work distasteful, he went to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. There he saw 
the gifts and favours bestowed on the Buddha’s disciples and joined the Order. 
He was very greedy, and went about with a large bowl made of dried gourd, which 
he kept under his bed at night and which made a scraping sound when touched; but 
the Buddha refused to allow him a bag for it until it should be worn down by 
constant contact. Later he followed the Buddha’s advice, conquered his 
intemperance in diet, and became an arahant. He then announced before the Buddha 
his readiness to answer the questions of any doubting monks, thus uttering his 
“lion’s roar.” The Buddha declared him chief of the “lion roarers.” (A.i.23; 
AA.i.112f.; ThagA.i.245f.; UdA. 252; SA.iii.26). The Udāna (iv.6) contains the 
praise uttered by him of the Buddha, because of his perfected self mastery.</p>
<p>Pindola was in the habit of taking his siesta in Udena’s 
park at Kosambī. (He had been king in a former birth and had spent many days in 
that park.) One day Udena’s women, who had come to the park with him, left him 
asleep and crowded round Pindola to hear him preach. Udena, noticing their 
absence, went in search of them, and, in his anger, ordered a nest of red ants 
to be put on Pindola’s body. But Pindola vanished and returned to 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, 
where the Buddha related the Mahānāga Jātaka* and also the 
<a href="guhatthaka_s.htm" title="g/guhatthaka_s.htm">Guhatthaka Sutta</a> 
(SNA.ii.514f). Later, (S.iv.110f.; SA.iii.26) we find Udena consulting him at 
the same spot and following his advice regarding the control of the senses.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* J.iv.375 ff.; SA.iii.26 says that when the king went 
  to fetch the red ants from an asoka tree, the ants fell on him and started to 
  sting him. The women, under pretence of helping him, picked up the ants that 
  fell from him and replaced them on his body, because they were angry at his 
  rudeness to Pindola.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Vinaya (Vin.ii.110f.; the story is given in greater 
detail at DhA.iii.201ff.; see also J.iv.263) we find the Buddha rebuking 
Pindola for performing a cheap miracle. The setthi of Rājagaha had placed a 
sandal wood bowl on a high pole and challenged any holy person to bring it down. 
Pindola heard of this and, at Moggallāna’s suggestion, rose in the air by magic 
power and brought it down. The Buddha blamed him for using his great gifts for 
an unworthy end. The bowl was given to the monks to be ground into sandal paste.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha, Pindola had been a lion 
in <a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himavā</a>. The Buddha visited the lion in his cave, who waited on him for seven 
days, paying him great honour. Later, the lion died and was reborn in 
<a href="hamsavatii.htm" title="h/hamsavatii.htm">Hamsavatī</a>, 
where he heard the Buddha preach and declare one of his disciples chief of the 
“lion roarers.” Eight kappas ago he was a king named Paduma. AA.i.111f.; 
Ap.i.50f.; ThagA.i.244f.; the last seems to identify him with Piyālaphaladāyaka 
of the Apadāna. (ii.444).</p>
<p>The <a href="theragaathaa.htm" title="t/theragaathaa.htm">Theragāthā</a> contains two verses (vs.123 4) of Pindola, 
uttered by him to a former friend, to convince him that he was no longer greedy 
and self-seeking. The <a href="milindapanha.htm" title="me_mu/milindapanha.htm">Milindapañha</a> (pp. 398, 404) contains two other verses not 
traced elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> says (UdA.252; see also SA.iii.26) that Pindola 
was so called because he entered the Order from love of food (pindam ulamāno 
pariyesamāno pabbajito ti, Pindolo)</p>
