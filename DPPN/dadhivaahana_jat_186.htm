<p>Once four brothers of Kāsi became 
ascetics in the Himālayas. The eldest died and was born as Sakka; he visited the 
others, and gave them, respectively, a magic razor-axe, which could be used as 
razor or axe; a drum, one side of which drove away elephants, while the other 
made friends of them; and a bowl from which a stream of curd flowed at its 
possessor’s will. In a beautiful island far away lived a wild boar who owned a 
gem which enabled its possessor to travel through the air. A shipwrecked sailor 
from Kāsi stole this while the boar slept, and, with it, travelled to the 
Himālaya. There he saw the ascetics, and, in exchange for the gem, obtained from 
them their magic possessions, afterwards returning and killing them, so that he 
regained the gem. He then went to <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and took possession of the throne, 
becoming known as King Dadhivāhana, because he destroyed his enemies by drowning 
them in a river of curds. In his garden grew a mango tree, sprung from a mango 
which had floated down from Lake Kannamunda. He sent fruits from this tree as 
presents to the neighbouring kings, but always pricked the mango stone with a 
thorn so that it should not bear fruit. Once, an offended king sent to 
Dadhivāhana a gardener whom he had bribed to destroy the flavour of the mangoes. 
The king gave him employment, but the gardener, by growing bitter creepers round 
the mango tree, destroyed the flavour of the fruit. The Bodhisatta, who was the 
king’s councillor, discovered the plot and had the creepers uprooted.</p>
<p>The story was related to illustrate the 
effects of evil association (J.ii.101-6).</p>
