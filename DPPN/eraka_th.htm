<p>An arahant. He was the son of an eminent 
family of Sāvatthi. He had many advantages over others, among them beauty and 
charm. His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because it was his last 
life, he sought the Buddha. After hearing the Buddha preach he left the world, 
but for several days he was overcome by evil thoughts. The Buddha thereupon 
admonished him in a verse, and Eraka gained arahantship (Thag.v.93; 
ThagA.i.192f; for the name see Brethren, p.86, n.2).</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was 
a householder. One day he saw the Buddha and, having nothing to give, cleaned 
the road along which the Buddha walked and stood looking at him with clasped 
hands. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Suppabuddha.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Maggadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.173.</p>
