  <h2>Cetiyavāda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A later offshoot of the Mahāsanghika 
school, through the Paññatti and Bāhulika sects of the Gokulikavāda (Mhv.v.7; 
Dpv.v.42; Mbv.96f).</p>
<p>Bhavya, quoted by Rockhill, says that 
the Caityas received their name from their having dwelt in the Caitya Mountain. 
Op. Cit., 183; for an account of the Cetiyavādins see de la Vallée Poussin’s 
“The Five Points of Mahādeva” in J.R.A.S., April, 1910, 413ff. Mahādeva is 
considered as their founder; his points are purely speculative. They are all 
alleged to have been held also by the Pubbaseliyas.</p>
