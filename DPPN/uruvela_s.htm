<p>1. Uruvela Sutta.-Preached at Jetavana. 
The Buddha tells the monks how, when he was at Uruvel훮, under the Ajap훮la tree, 
he realised that there was no one in the world worthy to be his teacher. So he 
decided to obey and serve the Dhamma. Sahampat카 appeared and told him that such 
had been the custom of previous Buddhas also (A.ii.20f).</p>
<p>2. Uruvela Sutta.-The Buddha tells the 
monks how a number of brahmins bad visited him at Uruvel훮 and asked him if it 
were true that he did not reverence old men? He taught them how it was not old 
age which deserved reverence, but the qualities which men possessed, and he set 
forth those qualities (A.ii.22f).</p>
