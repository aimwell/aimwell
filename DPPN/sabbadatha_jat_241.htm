  <h2>Sabbadātha Jātaka (No. 241)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once chaplain to the king of Benares 
and knew a spell called Pathavījaya (subduing the world). One day he retired to 
a lonely place and was reciting the spell. A jackal, hiding in a hole near by, 
overheard it and learned it by heart. When the Bodhisatta had finished his 
recital, the jackal appeared before him, and saying: “Ho, brahmin, I have learnt 
your spell,” ran away. The Bodhisatta chased him, but in vain. As a result of 
learning the spell, the jackal subdued all the creatures of the forest and 
became their king, under the name of Sabbadātha. On the back of two elephants 
stood a lion and on the lion’s back sat Sabbadātha, with his consort.</p>
<p>Filled with pride, the jackal wished to capture Benares, 
and went with his army and besieged the city. The king was alarmed, but the 
Bodhisatta reassured him, and, having learnt from Sabbadātha that he proposed to 
capture the city by making the lions roar, gave orders to the inhabitants to 
stop their ears with flour. Then he mounted the watch tower and challenged 
Sabbadātha to carry out his threat. This Sabbadātha did, and even the lions on 
which he rode joined in the roar. The elephants were so terrified that, in their 
fright, they dropped Babbadātha, who was trampled to death. The carcases of the 
animals which died in the tumult covered twelve leagues.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempts 
to injure the Buddha, which only resulted in working harm upon himself.</p>
<p>The jackal is identified with Devadatta and the king with 
Ānanda (J.ii.242 6).</p>
<p>The story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha (Mil. P. 
202), and there the Bodhisatta’s name is given as Vidhura. </p>
