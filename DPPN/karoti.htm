<p>A class of spirits, associated with the 
Nāgas and forming one of the five defences of the Devas against the Asuras. The 
Jātaka scholiast says that Karoti is a name for the Supannas (a species of 
Garuda), and that they were so called because of their food and drink which were 
called Karoti (tesam karoti nāma pānabhojanam). J.i.204; cp. Karotapānayah, 
given as the name of a class of Yaksas (Mtu.i.30, 394); also Dvy.218.</p>
