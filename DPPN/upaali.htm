<p><b>1. Upāli Thera.</b>-One of the most eminent 
of the Buddha’s immediate disciples. He belonged to a barber’s family in 
Kapilavatthu and entered the service of the Sākiyan princes. When Anuruddha and 
his cousins left the world and sought ordination from the Buddha at Anupiyā 
Grove, Upāli accompanied them. They gave him all their valuable ornaments, but, 
on further consideration, he refused to accept them and wished to become a monk 
with them. The reason given for his refusal is that he knew the Sākyans were 
hot-headed, and feared that the kinsmen of the princes might suspect him of 
having murdered the young men for the sake of their belongings.</p>
<p>At the request of the Sākiyan youths, 
the Buddha ordained Upāli before them all, so that their pride might be humbled. 
(Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.116f; see also Bu.i.61; but see BuA.44; the Tibetan sources 
give a slightly different version, see Rockhill, op. cit., pp. 55-6; according 
to the Mahāvastu iii.179, Upāli was the Buddha’s barber, too). </p>
<p>Upāli’s upajjhāya was Kappitaka 
(Vin.iv.308). When Upāli went to the Buddha for an exercise for meditation, he 
asked that he might be allowed to dwell in the forest. But the Buddha would not 
agree, for if Upāli went into the forest he would learn only meditation, while, 
if he remained amongst men, he would have knowledge both of meditation and of 
the word of the Dhamma. Upāli accepted the Buddha’s advice and, practising 
insight, in due course won arahantship. The Buddha himself taught Upāli the 
whole of the Vinaya Pitaka (ThagA.i.360f, 370; AA.i.172).</p>
<p>In the assembly of the Sangha, the 
Buddha declared him to be the most proficient of those who were learned in the 
Vinaya (vinayadharānam) (A.i.24; see also Vin.iv.142, where the Buddha is 
mentioned as speaking Upāli’s praises). He is often spoken of as having reached 
the pinnacle of the Vinaya, or as being its chief repository (Vinaye 
agganikkhitto), (E.g., Dpv.iv.3, 5; v.7, 9) and three particular cases — those 
of Ajjuka (Vin.iii.66f), the Bhārukacchaka monk (Vin.iii.39) and Kumāra-Kassapa 
(AA.i.158; MA.i.336; J.i.148; DhA.iii.145) — are frequently mentioned in this 
connection as instances where Upāli’s decisions on Vinaya rules earned the 
special commendation of the Buddha. In the Rājagaha Council, Upāli took a 
leading part, deciding all the questions relative to the Vinaya, in the same way 
as Ānanda decided questions regarding the Dhamma (Vin.ii.286f; DA.i.11f; 
Mhv.iii.30).</p>
<p>In accordance with this tradition, 
ascribing to Upāli especial authority regarding the rules of the Order, various 
instances are given of Upāli questioning the Buddha about the Vinaya 
regulations. Thus we find him consulting the Buddha as to the legality or 
otherwise of a complete congregation performing, in the absence of an accused 
monk, an act at which his presence is required (Vin.i.325f). Again, he wishes to 
know if, in a matter which has caused altercations and schisms among members of 
the Order, the Sangha declares re-establishment of concord without thorough 
investigation, could such a declaration be lawful? (Vin.i.358f). When a monk 
intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter that has to be decided, 
under what conditions should he do so? What qualities should a monk possess in 
himself before he takes upon himself to warn others? (Vin.ii.248f). In what case 
can there be an interruption of the probationary period of a monk who has been 
placed on probation? (Vin.ii.33f).</p>
<p>A whole list of questions asked by Upāli 
and answers given by the Buddha on matters pertaining to the Vinaya rules is 
found in the chapter called Upāli-Pañcaka in the Parivāra (Vin.v.180-206; see 
also the Upālivagga of the Anguttara Nikāya v.70ff).</p>
<p>It is not possible to determine which of 
these and other questions were actually asked by Upāli, and which were ascribed 
to him on account of his traditional reputation.</p>
<p>It is said (E.g., Vin.iv.142; Sp.iv.876) 
that even in the Buddha’s lifetime monks considered it a great privilege to 
learn the Vinaya under Upāli. The monks seem to have regarded Upāli as their 
particular friend, to whom they could go in their difficulties. Thus, when 
certain monks had been deprived by thieves of their clothes, it is Upāli’s 
protection that they seek (Vin.iii.212; see also the story of Ramanīyavihārī, 
ThagA.i.116).</p>
<p>The canon contains but few records of 
any discourses connected with Upāli, apart from his questions on the Vinaya. In 
the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iv.143f) he is mentioned as asking the Buddha for a 
brief sermon, the Buddha telling him that if there were anything that did not 
conduce to revulsion and detachment, Upāli could be sure that such things did 
not form part of the Buddha’s teaching. There is a record of another sermon 
(A.v.201ff) which the Buddha is stated to have preached when Upāli expressed the 
desire to retire into the solitude of the forest. The Buddha tells him that 
forest-life is not for the man who has not mastered his mind or attained to 
tranquillity.</p>
<p>For other sermons see Upāli Sutta and 
Ubbāhika Sutta.</p>
<p>Three verses are ascribed to Upāli in 
the Theragāthā (vv. 249-51; but see Gotama the Man, p.215; another verse 
ascribed to Upāli, but so far not traced elsewhere, is found in the Milinda 
p.108) where he admonishes the brethren to seek noble friends of unfaltering 
character, to learn the monks' code of discipline and to dwell in solitude.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara, Upāli was a 
very rich brahmin named Sujāta. When the Buddha came to his father’s city in 
order to preach to him the Dhamma, Sujāta saw him, and in the assembly be 
noticed an ascetic named Sunanda, holding over the Buddha for seven days a 
canopy of flowers. The Buddha declared that Sunanda would, in the time of Gotama 
Buddha, become famous as the Elder Punna Mantānī-putta. Sujāta, too, wished to 
seethe future Buddha Gotama, and having heard Padumuttara praise the monk Pātika 
as chief of the Vinayadharas, he wished to hear, regarding himself, a similar 
declaration from Gotama. With this end in view he did many deeds of merit, chief 
of which was the erection of a monastery named Sobhana, for the Buddha and his 
monks, at an expense of one hundred thousand.</p>
<p>As a result he was born in heaven for 
thirty thousand kappas and was one thousand times king of the devas. One 
thousand times, too, he was cakkavatti.</p>
<p>Two kappas ago there was a Khattiya 
named Añjasa, and Upāli was born as his son Sunanda. One day he went to the park 
riding an elephant named Sirika, and met, on the way, the Pacceka Buddha Devala, 
whom he insulted in various ways. Sunanda was, thereupon, seized with a 
sensation of great heat in his body, and it was not till he went with a large 
following to the Pacceka Buddha and asked his pardon that the sensation left 
him. It is said that if the Buddha had not forgiven him, the whole country would 
have been destroyed. This insult paid to the Pacceka Buddha was the cause of 
Upāli having been born as a barber in his last birth (Ap.i.37ff).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.272, 283) that 
while the Buddha was yet alive Upāli drew up certain instructions according to 
which future Vinayadharas should interpret Vinaya rules, and that, in 
conjunction with others, he compiled explanatory notes on matters connected with 
the Vinaya.</p>
<p>In direct pupillary succession to Upāli 
as head of the Vinayadharas was Dāsaka, whom Upāli had first met at the 
Valikārāma, where Upāli was staying (Mhv.v.10). Upāli taught him the whole of 
the Vinaya.</p>
<p>Upāli’s death was in the sixth year of 
Udāyibhadda’s reign. Dpv.v.7ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Upāli.</b>-A lad of Rājagaha. His 
parents, wishing him to live a life of ease, did not have him instructed in any 
of the usual means of livelihood, lest he should be inconvenienced while 
learning them. After much consideration, they decided to have him ordained. He 
joined the Order with sixteen other companions equally young, and it is said 
that they rose at dawn and started shouting for food. This was the reason for 
the rule that no one under twenty years of age should receive the upasampadā 
ordination. Vin.i.77f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Upāli Thera.</b>-The Apadāna (i.91f) 
contains the story of a thera named Upāli, who is to be distinguished from the 
eminent disciple of that name, though the Apadāna verses obviously point to a 
confusion of the legends of the two. The Apadāna Commentary distinguishes this 
monk as “Bhāgineyya Upāli,” and states that he was a nephew of the Venerable 
Upāli. He was born in Kapilavatthu and was ordained by his uncle, who later 
became an arahant.</p>
<p>Bhāgineyya Upāli had been a householder 
in the time of Padumuttara. Later he left the world and became an ascetic in 
Himavā. There he met the Buddha and the monks, and uttered their praises in 
song. As a result he was eighteen times king of the devas and twenty-five times 
king of men.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Upāli.</b>-Distinguished as <b>Upāli-<a name="Gahapati">Gahapati</a></b>. 
He lived at <a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a> and was a follower of <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a>.  </p>
<p>He was present 
when <a href="diighatapassii.htm" title="d/diighatapassii.htm">Dīgha-Tapassī</a> reported to Nātaputta an account of his visit to the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> in the <a href="pavarika.htm" title="pa/pavarika.htm">Pāvārika</a> Mango-grove. Upāli undertook to go himself to the Buddha and 
refute his views, in spite of the protestations of Dīgha-Tapassī. At the end of 
his discussion with the Buddha, which is recorded in the <a href="upaali_s.htm" title="u/upaali_s.htm">Upāli Sutta</a>, Upāli is 
converted and invites the Buddha to a meal. Although the Buddha enjoins upon 
Upāli that his benefactions to the Niganthas should not cease because of his 
conversion, Upāli gives instructions that no Nigantha be admitted to his 
presence, but that if they need food it shall be given to them. Hearing a rumour 
of his conversion, first Tapassī, and later Nātaputta himself, go to Upāli’s 
house, where they learn the truth. When Nātaputta is finally convinced that 
Upāli has become a follower of the Buddha, hot blood gushes from his mouth 
(M.i.371ff).  </p>
<p>According to <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (MA.ii.621, 830), Nātaputta had to be 
carried on a litter to <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>, where he died shortly after.</p>
<p>Upāli became a  Sotāpanna (MA.ii.620).</p>
<p>He is mentioned, with <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>,
<a href="citta.htm" title="c/citta.htm">Citta-gahapati</a>, <a href="dhammika.htm#6" title="d/dhammika.htm#6">Dhammika-upāsaka</a> and 
<a href="khujjuttaraa.htm" title="ku/khujjuttaraa.htm">Khujjuttarā</a>, as one who had acquired the 
four Patisambhidā while being yet a learner (sekha). Vsm.ii.442; VibhA.388.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Upāli Thera.</b>-Head of the chapter of 
monks sent from Siam, at the request of Kittisirirājasīha, to re-establish the 
Upasampadā ordination in Ceylon. He was held in great esteem by the king of 
Ceylon and often preached to him. Upāli died in Ceylon of an incurable disease 
of the nose, and his funeral obsequies were held with great solemnity. Cv.c.71, 
94, 117, 127, 142.</p>
