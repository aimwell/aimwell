<p>A village in Ceylon. When Pandukābhaya 
was young, he lay there in concealment and escaped various attempts on his life 
(Mhv.x.1; Dpv.x.9). It was near the Cetiyapabbata, and Kundalī, friend of 
Dīghābhaya, lived there (Mhv.xxiii.23). Five hundred young men from this village 
were ordained by Mahinda (Mhv.xvii.59).</p>
