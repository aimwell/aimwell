<p>The fourth (in the present order) of the seven books of 
the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is, however, generally considered to be the earliest 
of the Abhidhamma books. Its subject matter is the puggala (person). The author 
first gives a table of contents of the whole work, and then follows the method 
of the Anguttara Nikāya, grouping human types first under one term, then under 
two, and so on up to ten. Several of the sections are found, almost complete, in 
the corresponding sections of the Anguttara. Others are found in the Sangīti 
Sutta. For details see Morris' edition in the P.T.S. series (Introd. x xi).</p>
