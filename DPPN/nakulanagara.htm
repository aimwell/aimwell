<p>A village in Ceylon, near Guttasāla. When Guttasāla was 
destroyed by bandits, an arahant theri, with a young nun, came to this village, 
and there she was seen by Thera Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, sitting at the 
foot of a tree. The thera offered her food, but she had no bowl, and the thera 
lent her his. We are told that, as a result, he never had trouble in obtaining 
alms. DhSA. 298 f.</p>
