<p>Husband of Dīghatālā. He obtained his 
wife after having worked seven years in a house. One day, when on his way with 
his wife to visit her parents, they came to a stream, and, while they were 
hesitating before crossing, a man named Dīghapitthi came along and offered to 
take them across, because, he said, he was well known to the denizens of the 
river. He took Dīghatālā first, with the sweetmeats intended for her relations, 
and persuaded her to come with him, leaving her husband. When Golakāla realised 
what had happened, he jumped into the stream in desperation, easily crossing it 
- because it was really very shallow — and claimed his wife. In the course of 
the quarrel between the two men they came to where Mahosadha held court, and be, 
having heard their respective stories, decided, with the approval of the 
assembled populace, in favour of Golakāla.</p>
<p>It is said Golakāla was so called 
because he was dwarfish, like a ball (gola), and black (kāla). J.vi.337, 338.</p>
