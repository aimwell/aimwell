  <h2>Kammāsadamma, Kammāsadhamma (v.l. Kammasa°)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A township of the 
<a href="kuru.htm" title="ku/kuru.htm">Kurūs</a>. The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, 
during the course of his wanderings, stayed there several times; the exact place 
of his residence is, however, mentioned only once, namely the fire-hut of a brahmin of the 
<a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja-gotta</a>, where a grass mat was spread for him by the 
brahmin. It was on this occasion, according to the 
<a href="maagandiya_s.htm" title="ma/maagandiya_s.htm">Māgandiya Sutta</a> (M.i.501), 
that, after a long discussion, <a href="maagandiya.htm" title="ma/maagandiya.htm">Māgandiya</a> was converted.  </p>
<p>Several important 
discourses were preached at Kammāsadamma, among them being:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>the <a href="mahanidana_s.htm" title="maha/mahanidana_s.htm">Mahānidāna 
Sutta</a> (D.ii.55; S.ii.92)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the
<a href="mahasatipatthana_s.htm" title="maha/mahasatipatthana_s.htm">Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.290; 
M.i.55)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the 
<a href="aananjasapaaya_s.htm" title="aa/aananjasapaaya_s.htm">Ānañjasappāya Sutta</a> 
(M.ii.26)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.107f) contains a 
discourse on handling experiences by way of casual relations, and the Anguttara 
(A.v.29f ) a discourse on the ten noble states (ariyavāsā), both preached at 
Kammāsadhamma.  </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (SA.ii.89) says that the people there were full of 
wisdom and their food was nutritious; it was therefore a compliment to their 
intellectual calibre that the Buddha should have preached these suttas to them.</p>
<p>Even in Buddhaghosa’s day the name of 
the township had two different spellings, and two etymologies are suggested for 
the names (DA.ii.483). The place was called Kammāsadamma because it was here 
that the man-eating ogre, <a href="kammasapaada.htm" title="ka/kammasapaada.htm">Kammāsapāda</a> was tamed and civilized by the 
Bodhisatta. (Kammāso ettha damito ti, Kammāsadamam-Kammāso ti Kammāsapādo 
porisādo vuccati.)  </p>
<p>The spelling Kammāsadhamma is explained on the ground that 
the people of the <a href="kuru.htm" title="ku/kuru.htm">Kuru</a> country had a code of honour called the Kuruvattadhamma; 
it was here that Kammāsa (already referred to) was converted and made to accept 
this code, hence the name of the township. (Kururatthavāsīnam kira 
kuruvattadhammo, tasmim Kanamāso jāto, tasmā tam thānam “Kammāso ettha dhamme 
jāto” ti Kammāsadhammam ti vuccati.)</p>
<p>According to the Jātakas, there are two 
places of the same name, called Cūlakammāsadamma and Mahākammāsadamma 
respectively, to distinguish one from the other. Mahākammāsadamma, which was 
evidently the original place, was founded on the spot where the porisāda of the 
<a href="mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm" title="maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm">Mahāsutasoma Jātaka</a> was tamed (J.v.411), while Cūlakammāsadamma was the name 
given to the place where <a href="jayaddisa_jat_513.htm" title="j/jayaddisa_jat_513.htm">Jayaddisa</a> showed his prowess by his spiritual victory 
over the ogre in the <a href="jayaddisa_jat_513.htm" title="j/jayaddisa_jat_513.htm">Jayaddisa Jātaka</a> (J.v.35f).</p>
<p>In the Divyāvadāna (pp.515f), the place 
is called Kammāsadamya. It was the residence of the nuns 
<a href="nanduttara.htm" title="n/nanduttara.htm">Nanduttarā</a> and 
<a href="mittakali.htm" title="me_mu/mittakali.htm">Mittākālikā</a> (ThigA.87, 89).</p>
