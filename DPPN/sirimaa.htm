<p><b>1. Sirimā Thera. </b>He was born in the family of a 
householder of Sāvatthi and was called Sirimā on account of the unfailing 
success of his family. His younger brother was Sirivaddha. They were both 
present when the Buddha accepted Jetavana, and, struck by his majesty, they 
entered the Order. Sirivaddha, though possessed of no special attainments, 
received great honour from the laity and recluses, but Sirimā was little 
honoured. Nevertheless, exercising calm and insight, he soon won arahantship. 
Ordinary monks and novices continued to disparage him, and the Thera had to 
blame them for their faulty judgment. Sirivaddha, agitated by this, himself 
became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, before the Buddha’s 
appearance in the world, Sirimā was an ascetic, named Devala, with a large 
following, and, having learnt the power of the Buddha through a study of the 
science of prognostication, he built a sand thūpa, to which he paid homage in 
the name of past Buddhas. The Buddha was born in the world, his birth being 
accompanied by various omens. The ascetic showed these to his pupils, and, 
having made them eager to see the Buddha, died, and was reborn in the Brahma 
world. Later, he appeared before them, inspiring them to greater exertions (Thag.vss. 
159-60; ThagA.i.279f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Pulinuppādaka Thera of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.426.</p>

<p><b>5. Sirimā.</b> Wife of Anomadassī Buddha before his 
renunciation. Bu.viii.19.</p>

Sumedha Buddha. Bu.xii.25.</p>

<p><b>7. Sirimā.</b> One of the chief lay women supporters of

Vessabhū Buddha. Bu.xxii.25.</p>

Buddha in his last lay life. Bu.xx.24.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Sirimā.</b> One of the palaces occupied by Mangala 
Buddha in his last lay life. BuA.116.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Sirimā.</b> A courtesan of Rājagaha and younger 
sister of Jīvaka. She was once employed by Uttarā (Nandamātā) to take her place 
with her husband (Sumana) while Uttarā herself went away in order to indulge in 
acts of piety. During this time Sirimā tried to injure Uttarā, on account of a 
misunderstanding, but on realizing her error, she begged forgiveness both of 
Uttarā, and, at the latter’s suggestion, of the Buddha. (The details of this 
incident are given Uttarā Nandamātā.) At the conclusion of a sermon preached by 
the Buddha in Uttarā’s house, Sirimā became a sotāpanna. From that day onwards 
she gave alms daily to eight monks in her house.</p>
<p>A monk in a monastery, three leagues away, having heard of 
the excellence of Sirimā’s alms and of her extraordinary beauty from a visiting 
monk, decided to go and see her. Having obtained a ticket for alms, he went to 
her house, but Sirimā was ill, and her attendants looked after the monks. When 
the meal had been served she was brought into the dining hall to pay her 
respects to the monks. The lustful monk at once fell in love with her and was 
unable to eat. That same day Sirimā died. The Buddha gave instructions that her 
body should not be burnt, but laid in the charnel ground, protected from birds 
and beasts. When putrefaction had set in, the king proclaimed that all citizens, 
on penalty of a fine, should gaze on Sirimā’s body. The Buddha, too, went with 
the monks, the lustful monk accompanying them. The Buddha made the king 
proclaim, with beating of the drum, that anyone who would pay a thousand could 
have Sirimā’s body. There was no response. The price was gradually lowered to 
one eighth of a penny. Yet no one came forward, even when the body was offered 
for nothing. The Buddha addressed the monks, pointing out how even those who 
would have paid one thousand to spend a single night with Sirimā would not now 
take her as a gift. Such was the passing nature of beauty. The lustful monk 
became a sotāpanna (DhA.iii.104f.; VvA.74ff).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.244f, 253f ) that Sirimā was 
Sālavati’s daughter, and succeeded to her mother’s position as courtezan. After 
death, Sirimā was born in the Yāma world as the wife of Suyāma. When the Buddha 
was speaking to the monks at her cremation, she visited the spot with five 
hundred chariots. Janapadakalyānī Nandā, who at that time was also a nun, was 
present, and when the Buddha preached the Kāyavicchandanika Sutta (q.v.) she 
became an arahant, while Sirimā became an anāgāmī.</p>
<p>The Vimānavatthu (pp.78f., 86) gives the same story, 
adding that Vangīsa was also present at the preaching of the sermon, and, having 
obtained the Buddha’s permission, questioned Sirimā and made her reveal her 
identity. Here Sirimā is said to have been born in the Nimmānarati-world, and no 
mention is made of her becoming an anāgāmī; while the lustful monk is said to 
have become an arahant. Sirimā is mentioned in a list of eminent upāsikās 
(A.iv.347; AA.ii.791). Eighty four thousand persons realized the truth after 
listening to the Buddha’s preaching at the cremation of Sirimā. Mil.350.</p>
