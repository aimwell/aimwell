<p>1. Jānussonī Sutta.-Jānussonī visits the 
Buddha and tells him that if anyone has gifts to distribute he should give them 
to the tevijja brahmins. At the Buddha’s request, he describes these brahmins, 
and the Buddha, in his turn, tells him what is considered the threefold-lore (tevijjā) 
by the Ariyans. A.i.166.</p>
<p>2. Jānussonī Sutta.-Jānussonī visits the 
Buddha, who tells him that it is one extreme to say that everything exists, 
another to say nothing exists — and teaches him the Doctrine of the Middle Way, 
the paticcasamuppāda. S.ii.76.</p>
