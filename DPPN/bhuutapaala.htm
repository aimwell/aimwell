<p><b>1. Bhūtapāla. </b>An example of one who possessed ñānavipphāra iddhi 
(PS.ii.211). He was the child of a poor man of Rājagaha, and went one day with 
his father in a cart to the forest to collect firewood. By the time they 
returned to the town gate, evening had fallen. The cart was halted awhile, and 
the oxen, having got free from the yoke, entered the town. Telling the child to 
sit near the cart, the father set off after the oxen. Before he could return, 
the gate was shut, and the child owed his escape during the night from wild 
beasts and demons to his ñānavipphāra-iddhi.</p>
<p>Although the place where he slept was near to a cemetery, 
no evil spirit could harm the boy as that birth was destined to be his last. He 
later joined the Order and became an arahant, being famed as Bhūtapāla Thera. 
PSA. 493f.; Vsm.379f.</p>

<p><b>2. Bhūtapāla. </b>The Vibhanga Commentary in 
  explaining the term kāsāvapajjota says that it means “resplendent with the 
  colour of orange, completely (ekobhāsinī) like the family of Bhūtapālasetthi” 
  (Bhūtapālasetthikulasadisānī). VibhA.342; see also Bhūtavālika.</p>
