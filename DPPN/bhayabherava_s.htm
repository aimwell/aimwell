  <h2>Bhayabherava Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Jānussoni visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him how 
it is that young men who have left the world under him should be able to live in 
solitude, in the depths of the forest, a joyless life. The Buddha answers that 
while yet a Bodhisatta he was assailed by the same doubts. Fear comes only to 
him whose heart is filled with desire and longing, and who is restless, witless, 
and drivelling. </p>
<p>But the man, who is pure, resolute, and free from 
corruptions of the heart, lives in confidence in the forest and develops the 
jhānas. The Buddha then describes how he passed through these stages of 
development before becoming the Enlightened One (M.i.16ff). </p>
<p>This sutta contains an account of the “threefold lore“
(tisso vijjā) of the Buddha (see Sp.i.116) and praises of the 
Saranā (Refuges) (Sp.i.172).</p>
