<p>1. Kutivihārī Thera.-An arahant. He was 
the son of a nobleman in the Vajji country, and having heard the Buddha preach 
the Ratana Sutta he left the world. One day, while striving after insight, he 
was caught in the rain and sought shelter in a woodman’s hut. As soon as he sat 
down there on a mat he became an arahant. The Buddha, having heard by virtue of 
his divine ear the conversation between the monk and the watchman, uttered 
verses of approbation. The monk was so called because he obtained insight in a 
hut.</p>
<p>In the past he had given cool water to 
Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.56; ThagA.i.129f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Udakapūjaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.142f.</p>
<p>2. Kutivihārī Thera.-An arahant. His 
story is similar to the above. He pursued his meditations in a very old hut and 
had thoughts of building another; but a spirit, seeking his welfare, pointed out 
to him in words which, though simple, carried a profound meaning, that a new hut 
would mean new pain. Thus urged on, Kutivihāri became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the past he gave a fan of split reeds 
to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.57; ThagA.i.130f). He is probably identical with 
Nalamāliya Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.143f.</p>
