<p>A mountain in Rohana on which Kākavanna-Tissa 
built a vihāra (Mhv.xxii.23) and Vasabha ten thūpas (Mhv.xxxv.81). Dāthopatissa 
gave to the vihāra the village of Gonnavitthi (CV.xlv.59). The mountain is 
described as being healthy (utusappāya) (MT.552), and sometimes there lived on 
it as many as twelve thousand monks (VibhA.445; Mhv.xxiv.9). Attached to the 
vihāra was the Ninkaponnapadhānaghara (VibhA.489) and the Kotagerukapāsāda — the 
residence of Bhāgineyya Sangharakkhita (MT.552) — and 
also, probably, a nunnery. (See VibhA.498). The Elders 
Mahānāga and Cūlanāga lived at Cittalapabbata for three years (SA.ii.125). 
The Commentaries” contain several stories connected with the mountain. (E.g., 
VibhA.264, 498; DhsA.351, 399; AA.i.386; MA.i.18, 66, 150, 223, 351, 399). Near 
by (AA.i.386) was the village of Kālumbara and the bathing place of 
Kuruvakatittha (MA.ii.1024). It was evidently a very important monastic centre 
in Ceylon, and is mentioned on a par with Abhayagiri and Cetiyapabbata 
(DA.ii.478). Cittalapabbata is sometimes called Cittalakūta. E.g., Mhv.xxxv.81.</p>
