<p>A rocky fortress in the Malaya district of Ceylon. Now 
Sīgiri, about thirty eight miles south east of Anurādhapura (Cv.Trs.i.42, n.1). 
Perhaps the rock itself resembled the form of a recumbent lion, especially the 
forepart of his body.</p>
<p>When Kassapa I. had slain his father, he took refuge 
there, clearing the land about the rock, surrounding it with a wall, and 
building a staircase to it in the form of a lion. Kassapa and his retinue lived 
in the fortress till he was defeated by his brother Moggallāna, and then killed 
himself (Cv.xxxix.2f). Mention is made of several vihāras on Sīhagiri, among 
them being Dalha and Dāthākondañña, which Moggallāna I. gave to the Dhammaruci 
and Sāgalika schools. Cv.xxxix.41. Perhaps the fortress was originally a centre 
of the Dhammarucikas, and Kassapa may have borrowed from them the idea of making 
use of it.</p>
<p>King Sanghatissa, his son, and his minister, were executed 
on Sīhagiri, at the command of Moggallāna III., (Cv.xliv.32f) and later 
Moggallāna himself was slain there by Silāmeghavanna (Cv.xliv.60). </p>
<p>The rock is now famous for its frescoes, which are very 
similar to those of Ajantā.</p>
