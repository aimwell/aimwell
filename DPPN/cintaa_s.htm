<p>1. Cintā Sutta.-Unprofitable reasoning 
about the world, life, etc., should be abandoned. Thoughts about Ill, etc., 
should be cultivated. S.v.418.</p>
<p>2. Cintā Sutta.-Once a man, having left 
Rājagaha, came to the Sumāgadhā Lotus Pond and started speculating about the 
world. He then saw a whole army entering a lotus-stalk. Thinking himself mad, he 
returned to the town, where he told people what he had seen; they confirmed his 
belief in his madness. But, in fact, said the Buddha, what he saw was real; he 
saw the Asura-host running away from the Devas and escaping through a lotus 
stalk. It is, therefore, unprofitable to speculate about the world. S.v.446f.</p>
