<p><b>1. Vanavāsī (Vanavāsika) Tissa. </b>A monk. In his 
previous birth he was the brahmin Mahāsena (q.v.). During pregnancy his mother 
invited Sāriputta with five hundred monks, to her house, and fed them on milk 
rice. She herself put on yellow robes and ate of the rice left by the monks. On 
the day of his naming, he presented Sāriputta with his blanket. He was called 
Tissa after Sāriputta, whose personal name was Upatissa. At the age of seven 
Tissa joined the Order and his parents held a festival lasting for seven days, 
distributing porridge and honey to the monks. On the eighth day, when Tissa went 
for alms in Sāvatthi, he received one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand 
pieces of cloth, all of which he gave to the monks. This earned for him the name 
of Pindapātadāyaka. One day, in the cold season, he saw monks warming themselves 
before fires and, discovering that they had no blankets, he, accompanied by one 
thousand monks, went into the city. Wherever he went people gave him blankets; 
one shopkeeper had hidden two of his very costly blankets, but on seeing Tissa 
he gave them willingly. Tissa thus got one thousand blankets and was thereafter 
called Kambaladāyaka.</p>
<p>Having discovered that, at Jetavana, his young relations 
came too often to see him, he obtained a formula of meditation and went into the 
forest to a distance of twenty leagues from Sāvatthi. At the request of the 
inhabitants of the village near by, he spent the rainy season in the forest 
hermitage, going into the village for alms. There, at the end of two months, he 
attained arahantship. Because he was so devoted to the forest, he was given the 
name of Vanavāsī. At the end of the vassa, all the Buddha’s chief disciples, 
with a retinue of forty thousand monks, visited Tissa in his hermitage, arriving 
there in the evening. The villagers, recognizing Sāriputta, asked him to preach 
the Dhamma, saying that Tissa, their teacher, knew only two sentences&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“May you be happy, may you obtain release from suffering!“&nbsp;&nbsp; which 
sentences he repeated whenever anyone made him a gift. Thereupon Sāriputta asked 
him to explain the meaning of the two sentences, and the novice preached till 
sunrise, summarizing the whole of the Buddha’s teaching “even as a thunderstorm 
rains incessantly upon the four great continents.”</p>
<p>At the end of the discourse Tissa’s supporters were 
divided into two camps, some were offended that he should not have preached to 
them before, while others marvelled at his saintliness and skill. The Buddha, 
aware of this disagreement, went himself to the village. The villagers gave alms 
to the Buddha and the monks, and, in returning thanks, the Buddha told them how 
fortunate they were that, owing to Tissa, they had been able to see himself and 
his chief disciples. They were then all satisfied.</p>
<p>On the way back to Sāvatthi, Tissa walked beside the 
Buddha and pointed out to him the various beautiful spots. The Buddha preached 
the Upasālhaka Jātaka to show that there was no spot on earth where men had not 
at some time died. In answer to a question of the Buddha, Tissa said that he 
never felt afraid of the animals in the forest, but only a greater love for the 
forest at the sound of their voices. He then recited fifty stanzas in praise of 
life in the wilds. Arrived at the outskirts of the forest, he took leave of the 
Buddha and Sāriputta and returned to live in his forest hermitage. DhA.ii.84-102. 
The visit of Buddha is also reported at DA.i.240 and MA.i.357, though the 
details are the different. There the Buddha is accompanied by Sāriputta and the 
chief disciples and twenty thousand arahants.</p>

<p><b>2. Vanavāsī Thera.</b> The Theragāthā Commentary 
(i.440) mentions a Vanavāsī Thera as the teacher of Tekicchakāni. This is 
probably not a proper name but only a descriptive epithet.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Vanavāsī Nikāya</b>. See Araññavāsī.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Vanavāsī Mahātissa. </b>A monk, probably distinct from 
Vanavāsī Tissa — see Vanavāsī (1). On the day 
that Alindakavāsī Mahā Phussadeva Thera attained arahantship, the devas stood by 
him, illuminating all the forest. Mahātissa saw the light, and the next day 
asked Phussadeva the reason for it, but his question was evaded. SA.iii.154f.</p>
