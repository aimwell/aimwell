<p>A mountain range in Himavā, sixty 
leagues in height. Here Irandatī sang her song, hearing which Punnaka, on his 
way to a meeting of the yakkhas, plighted his troth to her. After Punnaka had 
won Vidhura, he took him to Kālapabbata, and there tried by various means to 
kill him. His attempts failed, and Vidhura, learning the motive for his act, 
preached to him, seated on the top of the mountain, and converted him (J.vi.255, 
264, 302ff, 309, 326). In some places the mountain is called Kālagiri. E.g., 
ibid., 302, 304, 309, 326; see also Mtu.ii.300.</p>
