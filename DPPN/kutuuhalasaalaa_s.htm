<p>Vacchagotta asks the Buddha how his 
teaching on the subject of rebirth differs from that of other teachers; for 
example, of Pūrana Kassapa. The Buddha explains that, according to his own 
teaching, rebirth comes only to a being who has fuel, the fuel being craving 
(S.iv.398f).</p>
<p>The discussion arises out of a 
conversation which, according to Vacchagotta, took place among paribbājakas in 
the Kutūhalasālā.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.369; MA.ii.694) 
that there was no special place of that name; any place where discussions were 
held could be so called. See also D.i.179.</p>
