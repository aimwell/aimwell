<p>A naked ascetic of Vesāli, held in high 
repute by the Vajjians. He had taken seven vows: to wear no garments, to be 
chaste, to maintain himself only by spirituous drinks and flesh, eating no rice 
or gruel, never to go beyond the Udena shrine, the Gotamaka shrine, the Sattamba 
shrine, and the Bahuputta shrine. Sunakkhatta once visited him and asked him 
questions, but Kalāramatthuka would not listen, and showed resentment at being 
interrogated. When Sunakkhatta reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha predicted 
that the ascetic would, before long, wear garments, be married, eat rice and 
gruel, go beyond the limits he had until now observed, and fall in fame. And so 
it came to pass (D.iii.9ff). v.l. Kandaramasuka, Kalāra, Kalāra-matthaka.</p>
