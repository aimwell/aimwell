<p>He belonged to a Sākyan family of Kapilavatthu, and was so 
called because of the completeness of his gifts and fortune. His means allowed 
him to enjoy, at all times, food of one hundred essences. On hearing that the 
Buddha lived on very simple diet, he renounced the world, and entering the 
Order, became an arahant.</p>
<p>He had been a householder in the time of Dhammadassī 
Buddha and had offered various gifts at his shrine. Ninety four kappas ago he 
was king sixteen times under the name of Thūpasikhara (Thag.vs.91; 
ThagA.i.190f). He is probably identical with Thambhāropaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.171.</p>
