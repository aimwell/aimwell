<p>A city of the <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallas</a> which the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> visited during his 
last journey, going there from <a href="bhogagamanagara.htm" title="b/bhogagamanagara.htm">Bhogagāma</a> and stopping at 
<a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Cunda’s</a> mango grove.</p>
<p>Cunda lived in Pāvā and invited the Buddha to a meal, 
which proved to be his last. It was on this occasion that the 
<a href="cunda_s.htm" title="c/cunda_s.htm">Cunda Sutta</a> (1) 
was preached (SNA.i. 159). From Pāvā the Buddha journeyed on to 
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusinārā</a>, 
crossing the Kakkutthā on the way. D.ii.126 ff.; Ud.viii.5; the road from Pāvā 
to Kusināra is mentioned several times in the books&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., 
Vin.ii.284; D.ii.162. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="sangiti_sutta.htm" title="sa/sangiti_sutta.htm">Sangīti Sutta</a>, at the time the Buddha was 
staying at Pāvā, the Mallas had just completed their new Mote hall, 
<a href="ubbhataka.htm" title="u/ubbhataka.htm">Ubbhataka</a>, 
and, at their invitation, the Buddha consecrated it by first occupying it and 
then preaching in it. After the Buddha had finished speaking, 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> recited 
the Sahgīti Sutta to the assembled monks.</p>
<p>Pāvā was also a centre of the Niganthas and, at the time 
mentioned above, <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nāthaputta</a> had just died at Pāvā and his followers 
were divided by bitter wrangles (D.iii.210). Cunda Samanuddesa was spending his 
rainy season at Pāvā, and he reported to the Buddha, who was at 
<a href="samagama.htm" title="sa/samagama.htm">Sāmagāma</a>, news 
of the Niganthas' quarrels (Ibid., 117f.; M.ii.243f).</p>
<p>The distance from Pāvā to Kusināra was three gāvutas. It 
is said (UdA.403) that on the way between these two places, the Buddha had to 
stop at twenty five resting places, so faint and weary was he.</p>
<p>Mention is made in the Udāna (i.7) of the Buddha having 
stayed at the <a href="ajakalaapaka.htm" title="am/ajakalaapaka.htm">Ajakapālaka cetiya</a> in Pāvā. This may have been during a 
previous visit.</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, the Mallas of Pāvā claimed a 
share in his relics. <a href="dona.htm" title="d/dona.htm">Dona</a> satisfied their claim, and a Thūpa was erected in Pāvā 
over their share of the relics (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.3).</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Pāvā are called <a href="paveyyaka.htm" title="pa/paveyyaka.htm">Pāveyyakā</a>.
</p>
<p>Pāvā was the birthplace of <a href="khandasumana_th.htm" title="ku/khandasumana_th.htm">Khandasumana</a>.</p>
