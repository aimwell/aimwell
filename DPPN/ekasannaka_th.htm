<p><b>1. Ekasaññaka Thera.</b>-An arahant. In the 
past he gave a meal to a monk named Khanda, a disciple of Vessabhū Buddha. Forty 
kappas ago he was a king named Varuna (Ap.i.121). The Apadāna Commentary says he 
was given the name Ekasaññaka because in his last life he remembered his gift to 
Khanda.</p>

Thirty-one kappas ago he saw a rag-robe hanging in the forest, and gladdened by
