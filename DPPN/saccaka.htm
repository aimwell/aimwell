<p>A <a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Nigantha</a> who had two interviews with the Buddha, as 
recorded in the <a href="cuula_saccaka_s.htm" title="c/cuula_saccaka_s.htm">Cūla Saccaka Sutta </a>and 
<a href="mahasaccaka_s.htm" title="maha/mahasaccaka_s.htm">Mahā Saccaka Sutta</a>. He is addressed as Aggivessana, that being his gotta name (the Agnivesyāyanas).  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says 
(MA.i.450; cf. J.iii.1, where Sivāvatikā is called Avavādakā) that both his 
parents were Niganthas, skilled debaters, who married at the suggestion of the 
<a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavis</a>, because they were unable to defeat each other in argument. The 
Licchavis provided for their maintenance. Four daughters were born to them:
<a href="saccaa.htm" title="sa/saccaa.htm">Saccā</a>, <a href="lola.htm" title="l/lola.htm">Lolā</a>, 
<a href="patacara.htm" title="pa/patacara.htm">Patācārā</a> and Sivāvatikā. These engaged in a discussion with 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, and were defeated by him. Having then entered the Order, they became 
arahants. Saccaka was their brother and was the youngest of them. He was a 
teacher of the Licchavis and lived at Vesāli.</p>
<p>When Saccaka was defeated by the Buddha as stated in the 
Cūla-Saccaka Sutta, one of the Licchavis, <a href="dummukha.htm" title="d/dummukha.htm">Dummukha</a>, compared him to a crab in a 
pool, its claws being smashed one after the other and unable to return to the 
pool. Saccaka, owned defeat, and begged the Buddha to take a meal at his house. 
The Buddha agreed, and Saccaka became his follower (M.i.234f).</p>
<p>It is said (MA.i.469f) that, in a later birth, long after 
the Buddha’s death, Saccaka was born in Ceylon as the Thera Kāla Buddharakkhita 
and attained arahantship. </p>
<p>Saccaka, is identified with Senaka of the 
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahā 
Ummagga Jātaka</a>. J.vi.478.</p>
