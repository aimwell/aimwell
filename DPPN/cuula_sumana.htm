<p>1. Cūlasumana Thera.-An Elder of Ceylon, 
master of the Tipitaka and a well-known commentator. His explanation, given at 
Lohapāsāda, of the meaning of ubhatobhāgavimutta is regarded as the most 
authoritative interpretation (DA.ii.514). The Visuddhimagga (p.364; see also s.v. 
Cūlasumma) also mentions a Cūlasumana, resident at Ninkaponnakapadhānaghara on 
Cittalapabbata. He had discarded desire, and therefore the thought arose in him 
that he was a saint.</p>
<p>2. Cūlasumana.-A householder of Ceylon 
who fell down dead when Piturājā (q.v.) looked at him and gnashed his teeth in 
anger. Sp.ii.440f.</p>
<p>3. Cūlasumana.-A novice. In a past life 
he was the Sumanasetthi, under whom Annabhārā (q.v.) worked. In this age he was 
born at Munda, near the Viñjhā mountains, as the son of Mahāmunda. When 
Anuruddha became an arahant and looked back into his past lives he saw how 
Sumana had helped him. He therefore visited Mahāmunda and enjoyed his 
hospitality during one rainy season. At the end of his stay he obtained Munda’s 
consent to ordain Cūlasumana, who became an arahant while his head was being 
shaved. Once, when Anuruddha suffered from indigestion, the novice Sumana, 
having discovered that the water from Anotatta would cure him, went there and 
brought the water, in spite of all the efforts of the Nāga-king Pannaka (q.v.) 
to prevent him. Later, Pannaka, realising the novice’s power, asked his pardon 
and became his friend and servitor. When Anuruddha went with Sumana to Sāvatthi 
to visit the Buddha, some of the monks began to play with Sumana, patting his 
head and tweaking his ears. In order to show them Sumana’s power, Anuruddha 
asked Ānanda to summon all the novices in the monastery and ask them to fetch 
water from Anotatta that he might wash his feet. Only Sumana, the youngest of 
them all, was able to do this, and his fame spread beyond all measure 
(DhA.iv.128ff).</p>
