  <h2>Sunīta Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a family of flower scavengers in Rājagaha 
and eked out a miserable existence as road sweeper. One day the Buddha saw that 
Sunīta was destined for arahantship and visited him at dawn, as he was sweeping 
the street and collecting the scraps in his basket. Seeing the Buddha, he was 
filled with awe, and, finding no place to stand, stood stiffly against a wall. 
The Buddha approached him and asked if he would like to be a monk. He expressed 
great joy, and the Buddha ordained him with the “ehi bhikkhu” pabbajjā. Then he 
took Sunīta to the vihāra and taught him a subject of meditation, by which he 
won arahantship. Then many men and gods came to pay homage to him, and Sunīta 
preached to them on his way of attainment.</p>
<p>In the past he had spoken disparagingly of a Pacceka 
Buddha. Thag.vss.620-31; ThagA.i.540f.</p>
