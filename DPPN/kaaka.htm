<p>Slave of King <a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Canda-Pajjota</a>.  </p>
<p>His father 
was non-human, and he himself could travel sixty leagues a day. When Pajjota 
discovered that <a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka</a> had fled, after administering to him some medicine 
containing ghee, he sent Kāka to overtake Jīvaka and bring him back, giving Kāka 
strict injunctions not to eat anything offered by Jīvaka.  </p>
<p>Kāka came upon the 
physician at Kosambī having his breakfast. Jīvaka invited him to eat, but he 
refused. In the end, however, he consented to eat half a myrobalan, which he 
thought would be harmless, but into which Jīvaka had introduced some drug hidden 
in his finger nail. Kāka purged violently and was very alarmed. Jīvaka told him 
that all he desired was for him to be slightly delayed and left him, after 
having handed over to him the elephant Bhaddavatikā, which he had used in his 
flight. Vin.i.277f; DhA.i.196.</p>
