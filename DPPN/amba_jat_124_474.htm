<p><b>1. Amba Jātaka (No. 124).</b>-During a very 
severe drought a hermit, living in the Himālaya at the head of five hundred 
ascetics, provided water for the animals, using the hollowed trunk of a tree as 
trough. In gratitude the animals brought him various fruits, enough for himself 
and his five hundred companions. The story is related regarding a brother who 
was very zealous in his duties, doing everything well and wholeheartedly. 
Because of his great goodness the people fed regularly every day five hundred of 
the Brethren. J.i.449-51.</p>

<p><b>2. Amba Jātaka (No. 474).</b>-The story of a brahmin youth who learnt a charm from a wise Candāla. The charm had the power of 
making lovely and fragrant mangoes grow out of season. The youth exhibited his 
skill before the king, but when asked the name of his teacher he lied and said 
he had been taught in Takkasilā. Immediately the charm escaped his memory and 
all his power deserted him. At the king’s suggestion he went back to the teacher 
to ask his forgiveness and to learn the charm anew, but the teacher would have 
none of him and the youth wandered away into the forest and died there.</p>
<p>The story is told in reference to 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> who had repudiated the Buddha as his teacher and as a result was born 
in Avīci (J.iv.200-7).</p>
<p>The youth was a former birth of 
Devadatta.</p>
