  <h2>Navakammika Bhāradvāja</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the Bhāradvājas (q.v.). Once, when the Buddha was 
staying in a forest in Kosala, Navakammika, who was there seeing about some 
timber work, saw the Buddha at the foot of a tree and asked him what pleasure he 
found in his contemplations. When the Buddha explained to him how he had found 
liberty, the Brahmin was pleased and accepted the Buddha as his teacher 
(S.i.179).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.205) explains that this Brahmin had 
forest trees cut, and out of the timber had the framework for gables, roof 
terraces, etc., fitted, and these were then carried to the town and sold.</p>
