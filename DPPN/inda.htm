<p><b>1. Inda.</b>-Given in the Ātānātiya 
Sutta as the name of the ninety-one sons of Dhatarattha, king of the Gandhabbas. 
They are represented as being of great strength and followers of the Buddha 
(D.iii.197).</p>
<p>The name is also given as that of the 
ninety-one sons of Virūlha, king of the Kumbhandas (D.iii.198); of Virūpakkha, 
king of the Nāgas (p.199); and of Kuvera, king of the Yakkhas (p.202). Further 
on in the same sutta, Inda is mentioned with Soma, Varuna and others as a 
Yakkha, to whom appeal should be made by disciples of the Buddha when needing 
protection (p.204). </p>
<p>In the Mahā Samaya Sutta (D.ii.257f), 
also, Inda is mentioned as the name of the Sons of the Regent Gods of the Four 
Quarters.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Inda</b></p>
<p>The Pāli equivalent of 
the Vedic Indra. He is referred to only very seldom in the Nikāyas. In one such 
passage (D.i.244-5) he is mentioned with <a href="soma.htm" title="s/soma.htm">Soma</a>,
<a href="varuna.htm" title="va/varuna.htm">Varuna</a>, <a href="iisaana.htm" title="i_/iisaana.htm">Isāna</a>, 
<a href="pajapati.htm" title="pa/pajapati.htm">Pajāpati</a>, <a href="brahmaloka.htm" title="b/brahmaloka.htm">Brahmā</a>, Mahiddi and Yāma, as a god whom brahmins invoke and pray to, for union with 
Brahma after death. In another place, he is described as being seated in the 
company of Pajāpati and other gods in the Assembly Hall, named Sudhamma. Two of 
his companions, having listened to the admonition of Gopaka, became disciples of 
the Buddha and, as a result, far surpassed in glory Inda and his other companion 
devas. In the same context, <a href="vaasava.htm" title="va/vaasava.htm">Vāsava</a>, ruler of the gods, identified with 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, is 
addressed by <a href="gopaka.htm" title="g/gopaka.htm">Gopaka</a> as “Indra.” (Ibid., ii.274; in M.i.140; J.v.411 and vi.568, 
he is mentioned with Brahmā and Pajāpati; in J.iv.568, 571 is a list in which 
Inda appears with Brahmā, Pajāpati, Soma, Yama and Vessavana).</p>
<p>By the time of the compilation of the 
Nikāyas, the hold of the Vedic god Indra on the mind of the people seems to have 
become greatly weakened and Indra has been merged in Sakka, although, strictly 
speaking, Indra and Sakka are quite different conceptions. (See Sakka).</p>
<p>In the later literature, however, 
particularly in the <a href="jaatakatthakathaa.htm" title="j/jaatakatthakathaa.htm">Jātakatthakathā</a>, Indra’s name occurs frequently, but always 
as identified or identifiable with Sakka. In one place at least (J.v.115) the 
scholiast says, “Sakko ti Indo.”</p>
<p>In the 
<a href="ayakuuta_jat_347.htm" title="ay/ayakuuta_jat_347.htm">Ayakūta Jātaka</a> (J.iii.146), for 
example, Indra is called king of the gods (devārājā) in one verse, and in the 
next he is identified with Maghavā, husband of Sujā, and described as “devānam 
indo.” Indra is most revered of the gods (Sn.vs.316). He is free from old age 
and death, and is, therefore, the happiest type of king (Sn.vs.515), a condition 
that could be attained by sacrifice (Sn.vs.517). Alone he conquered the 
<a href="asura.htm" title="ay/asura.htm">Asuras</a> 
(J.iv.347; he is therefore called Asurinda and Asurādhipa ; see Asura). He is 
spoken of, as the lord of victors (jayatam pati) (J.v.322), and he is the 
embodiment of the greatest valour (Mhv.xxx.10).</p>
<p>Sometimes he visits the earth in 
disguise (J.v.33). He is also represented as punishing people guilty of heinous 
crimes; with his thunderbolt he smites them (DhA.iv.105).</p>
<p>The scene of his pleasures is in the 
Nandana pleasance (J.v.158), and his is the ideal enjoyment of pleasure, 
surrounded by friends (J.v.506; Sn.v.679) and by adoring wives (J.vi.240). The 
gods of Tāvatimsa are called Inda-purohitā, because, with Inda as their chief, 
they seek to promote the welfare of gods and men (J.vi.127; the Tāvatimsa gods 
are also described as being Sa-Indakā, ibid., 568). </p>
<p>Inda is called Tidivapuravara and 
Suravaratara (D.iii.176). His capital is Masakkasāra (J.vi.271; but see 
Amarāvatī).</p>
<p>In the sacrifice the palāsayatthi (Butea 
shoot), used by the sacrificing priest, is described as Indra’s right hand 
(J.vi.212).</p>
<p>Indra’s gotta, or clan, is the Kosiya 
(J.vi.501) ; he is called Vatrabhū in reference to his victory over Vatra (Skt. 
Vrtra) (J.v.153), and mention is made of his thunderbolt, the Indavajira 
(J.i.354) ; thus he is called Vajirahattha (D.ii.259; DA.ii.689). The sound of 
Indra’s thunderbolt striking its victim, surpasses all other sounds by its 
intensity, its volume and its fearfulness (UdA.67); no obstruction can stop the 
progress of Indra’s Vajira and it never misses its mark; it is avirajjhanaka 
(VibhA.333).</p>
<p>After his victory over the Asuras, 
images of him were made (Indapatimā) and placed round Cittakūta to frighten the 
Asuras away, in case they attempted to retrieve their lost honour (J.vi.125-6; 
see also J.i.203-4; DhA.i.280).</p>
<p>To be born into the company of Indra (Indasahavyatā) 
is considered very fortunate (E.g., J.v.411).</p>
<p>A species of coral red insect (kimi), 
noticeable after rain, are called Indagopakā. The reason for this name is not 
clear. (See Brethren, p.18 n., and N.P.D ).</p>
<p>The Udāna Commentary (p.75, n.12) seems 
to give Vidojā as an epithet of Indra; but this is probably a wrong reading, the 
correct one being, as in some MSS., “Visamucchājapam japanti.”</p>
<p>Inda was a special protector of cows, 
and when men began to kill these creatures he visited his wrath on them. 
Sn.v.310.</p>
