  <h2>Vidūdabha</h2>

</ul>
<p>Son of <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> and
<a href="vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm" title="va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa.htm">Vāsabhakhattiyā</a>. On the birth of 
Vidūdabha, the king, glad at having a son, sent word to his own grandmother asking 
her to choose a name. The minister who delivered the message was deaf, and when 
the grandmother spoke of Vāsabhakhattiyā as being dear to the king, mistook “vallabha” 
for “Vidūdabha,” and, thinking that this was an old family name, bestowed it on 
the prince. When the boy was quite young, Pasenadi conferred on him the rank of 
senāpati, thinking that this would please the Buddha. It was for the same reason 
he married Vāsabhakhattiyā; both in the <a href="piyajatika_sutta.htm" title="pu/piyajatika_sutta.htm">Piyajātika 
Sutta</a> (M.ii.110) and the 
<a href="kannakatthala_s.htm" title="ka/kannakatthala_s.htm">Kannakatthala Suttas</a> (M.ii.127) Vidūdabha is spoken of as senāpati.</p>
<p>When Vidūdabha was seven years old, he wished to visit his 
maternal grandparents, hoping to be given presents, like his companions by 
theirs, but Vāsabhakhattiyā persuaded him against this, telling him that they 
lived too far away. But he continued to express this desire, and when he reached 
the age of sixteen she consented to his going. Thereupon, accompanied by a large 
retinue, he set out for Kapilavatthu. The Sākiyans sent all the younger princes 
away, there being thus none to pay obeisance to him in answer to his salute, the 
remaining ones being older than he. He was shown every hospitality and stayed 
for several days. On the day of his departure, one of his retinue overheard a 
contemptuous remark passed by a slave woman who was washing, with milk and 
water, the seat on which Vidūdabha had sat. This was reported to him, and, 
having discovered the deceit which had been practiced on his father, he vowed 
vengeance on the Sākiyans. Pasenadi cut off all honours from Vāsabhakhattiyā and 
her son, but restored them later, at the Buddha’s suggestion.</p>
<p>After Pasenadi’s death, which was brought about by the 
treachery of Dīghakārāyana in making Vidūdabha king (for details see Pasenadi), 
Vidūdabha remembered his oath, and set out with a large army for Kapilavatthu. 
The Buddha, aware of this, stood under a tree, with scanty shade, just within 
the boundaries of the Sākiyan kingdom. On the boundary was a banyan which gave 
deep shade. Vidūdabha, seeing the Buddha, asked him to sit under the banyan. “Be 
not worried,” said the Buddha, “the shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool.” 
Vidūdabha understood and returned home with his army. This exposure to the sun 
gave the Buddha a headache which lasted through out his life (UdA.265; 
Ap.i.300).</p>
<p>Three times he marched against the Sākiyans and three times 
he saw the Buddha under the same tree and turned back. The fourth time the 
Buddha knew that the fate of the Sākiyans could not be averted and remained away. 
In a previous existence they had conspired and thrown poison into a river.</p>
<p>The Sākiyans went armed into the battle, but not wishing to 
kill, they shot their arrows into Vidūdabha’s ranks without killing anyone. On 
this being brought to Vidūdabha’s notice, he gave orders that all the Sākiyans, 
with the exception of the followers of the Sākiyan Mahānāma, should be slain. The 
Sākiyans stood their ground, some with blades of grass and some with reeds. These 
were spared, and came to be known as Tinasākyā and Nalasākiyā respectively.*
</p>
<p>The others were all killed, even down to the infants. 
Mahānāma was taken prisoner and went back with Vidūdabha, who wished him to 
share his meal. But Mahānāma said he wished to bathe, and plunged into a lake 
with the idea of dying rather than eating with a slave woman’s child. The Nāgas 
of the lake, however, saved him and took him to the Nāga world. That same night 
Vidūdabha pitched his camp on the dry bed of the Aciravatī. Some of his men lay 
on the banks, others on the river bed. Some of those who lay on the river bed 
were not guilty of sin in their past lives, while some who slept on the bank 
were. Ants appeared on the ground where the sinless ones lay, and they changed 
their sleeping places. During the night there was a sudden flood, and Vidūdabha 
and those of his retinue who slept in the river bed were washed into the sea. 
This account is taken from DhA.i.346 9, 357 61; but see also J.i.133 and 
iv.146f., 151f.</p>

<p>* According to Chinese records, Vidūdabha took five 
hundred Sākyan maidens into his harem, but they refused to submit to him and 
abused him and his family. He ordered them to be killed, their hands and feet to 
be cut off, and their bodies thrown into a ditch. The Buddha sent a monk to 
preach to them, and they were reborn after death in heaven. Sakra collected 
their bones and burnt them (Beal, op. cit.ii.11f.). The eleventh Pallava of the 
Avadānakalpalatā has a similar story. Vidūdabha killed seventy seven thousand 
Sākiyans and stole eighty thousand boys and girls. The girls were rude to him, 
and he ordered their death.</p>
