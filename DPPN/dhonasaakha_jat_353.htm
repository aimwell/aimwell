<p>Once a prince of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, named 
<a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>, learned the arts from the 
<a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>, then a teacher at
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>. 
The teacher (Pārāsariya), having observed his character, warned him against 
harshness and counselled him to be gentle. In due course, Brahmadatta became 
king, and on the advice of his chaplain, <a href="pingiya.htm" title="pu/pingiya.htm">Pingiya</a>, went out at the head of a 
large army and captured alive one thousand kings.  </p>
<p>He could not, however, take 
Takkasilā, and Pingiya suggested that a sacrifice be offered, to take the form 
of blinding the captive kinks and letting their blood flow round the rampart. 
This was done; but when Brahmadatta went to bathe, a Yakkha tore out his right 
eye, and, as be lay down, a sharp-pointed bone, dropped by a vulture, blinded 
his left eye. He died in agony and was born in hell.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
<a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhirājakumāra</a> who blinded the architect of his palace 
(<a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanada</a>), lest 
he should build another as grand. </p>
<p><a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhi</a> is identified with Brahmadatta and 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> with Pingiya (J.iii.157.161).</p>
