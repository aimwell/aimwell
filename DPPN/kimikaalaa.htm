<p>A river near Jantugāma. Meghiya Thera 
was attracted by a mango-grove on its banks and asked the Buddha’s permission to 
meditate there. Twice the Buddha refused; the third time he gave his permission. 
Meghiya went, but soon returned, finding that he could not concentrate his mind 
there. The river was evidently in the neighbourhood of Cālikā (A.iv.354f; 
ThagA.i.149; Ud.iv.1). </p>
<p>According to the Udāna Commentary 
(UdA.217), it was so called because it abounded in black worms (kālakimīnam 
bahulatāya).v.l. Kipillikā.</p>
