<p>1. Ghata Jātaka (No.355).-The story of 
Ghatakumāra (q.v.). It was related in reference to a minister of the Kosala 
king. He had been the king’s favourite, but then, influenced by slanderers, the 
king cast him into prison, where he entered the First Path. When he was released 
he visited the Buddha, who told him the Jātaka story.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with King Vanka of 
the Jātaka. J.iii.168ff</p>
<p>2. Ghata Jātaka (No.454).-The story of 
the Andhakavenhudāsa-putta (q.v.) and of the manner in which Ghatapandita (q.v.) 
assuaged the grief of his brother, Vāsudeva. The introductory story resembles 
that of the Matthakundali Jātaka.</p>
<p>Rohineyya is identified with Ānanda and 
Vāsudeva with Sāriputta (J.iv.79ff).</p>
<p>This Jātaka perhaps influenced the story 
of Ummādacittā found in the Mahavamsa (ix.13); for its connection with the 
Harivamsa, see ZDMG.53, 25ff.</p>
