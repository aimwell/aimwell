<hr>
<p><b>1. Jayasena</b>.-Father of Siddhattha Buddha 
(J.i.40; BuA.187). The Buddhavamsa (xvii.13) calls him Udena.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Jayasena</b>.-Father of Phussa Buddha 
(Bu.xix.14; J.i.41). The Buddha preached to him and he became an arahant 
(BuA.193). He was king of Kāsī and his wife was Sirima (PVA.19). See also 
Tirokuddapetavatthu.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="3">3</a>. Jayasena</b>.-King of <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>. His 
son was <a href="siihahanu.htm" title="s/siihahanu.htm">Sīhahanu</a> and his daughter 
<a href="yasodharaa.htm" title="y/yasodharaa.htm">Yasodharā</a>. His grandson was 
<a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a>. 
Mhv.ii.15.ff; Dpv.iii.44; MT.134; but see Mtu.i.352, where he is called Hastikasīrsa.  </p>
<p>The Tibetan sources call him Dhanvadurga. (Rockhill, p.13.)</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Jayasena</b></p>
<p>A prince who once visited 
the novice <a href="aciravata.htm" title="am/aciravata.htm">Aciravata</a> at 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a> in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and asked him to teach the 
Doctrine. Reluctantly the novice did so, but at the end of the exposition Jayasena declared that he was unable to agree with it.  </p>
<p>When this was reported to 
the Buddha he said that Jayasena, being given up to luxury, could not be 
expected to appreciate renunciation (M.iii.128).  </p>
<p>A 
discussion which Jayasena had with his uncle <a href="bhuumija_th.htm" title="b/bhuumija_th.htm">Bhūmiya Thera</a> is recorded in the
<a href="bhumija_s.htm" title="b/bhumija_s.htm">Bhūmiya Sutta</a>. In this case we are told that Jayasena was pleased with the 
discourse and entertained <a href="bhuumija_th.htm" title="b/bhuumija_th.htm">Bhūmiya</a> to his own dish of rice (M.iii.138).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (MA.ii.932) 
says that Jayasena was <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra’s</a> own son (Bimbisārassa putto orasako).</p>

<p><b>5. Jayasena</b>.-A king who built for 
Sobhita Buddha at Sudassana a vihāra one league in extent (Bu.vii.6; BuA.138).

at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa. Dpv.xix.8; MT.527.</p>
