<p>Long ago, many virtuous seers lived in 
huts on the seashore. At that time there was a war between the gods and the 
Asuras. The seers considered the gods righteous but feared harm from the Asuras. 
They went, therefore, to Sambara, lord of the Asuras, and asked him for a pledge 
of safety; he refused, saying that the seers were followers of Sakka. The seers 
thereupon cursed him to suffer everlasting terror. It is said that that same 
night Sambara woke up thrice, seized with fright (S.i.227-8).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (SA.i.266) adds that as a 
result of this curse, Sambara’s mind became deranged and he came to be called 
Vepacitti (crazy-nerve).</p>
