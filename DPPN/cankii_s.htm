  <h2>Cankī Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Cankī, with a large company of brahmins, 
visits the Buddha at Opasāda and finds him conversing with some eminent and aged 
brahmins. A young brahmin, called Kāpathika, frequently interrupts the 
conversation and is rebuked by the Buddha. Cankī tells the Buddha that the youth 
is a very clever scholar and obtains for him a chance of questioning the Buddha. 
The Buddha declares that the brahmin pretensions to possess the sole truth are 
vain, and goes on to explain how a man can come to have faith in truth, then 
gain enlightenment with regard to it, and finally attain the truth itself by 
means of practice and development. At the end of the discourse Kāpathika 
declares himself a follower of the Buddha. M.ii.164ff</p>
