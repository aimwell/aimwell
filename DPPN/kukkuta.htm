<p>1. Kukkuta.-One of three bankers of 
Kosambī, the others being Ghosaka and Pāvāriya. Having heard from some ascetics, 
whom they had entertained, of the appearance of the Buddha, they went with these 
ascetics to Sāvatthi, each carrying offerings in five hundred carts. Having 
heard the Buddha preach, they became sotāpannas. They gave alms to the Buddha 
for a fortnight, and then, with his permission, returned to Kosambī. They built 
monasteries in their gardens for the use of the Buddha and his monks, that built 
by Kukkuta being called the Kukkutārāma. The Buddha stayed one day at a time in 
each monastery, and on that day accepted the hospitality of its founder. 
DA.i.318f; DhA.i.203ff; AA.i.234f; PsA.414.</p>
<p>It is said (MA.i.540f) that the bankers 
built a monastery for each league on the road between Sāvatthi and Kosambī for 
the use of the Buddha during his journeys.</p>
<p>2. Kukkuta.-A frontier town near Himavā; 
the capital of a kingdom three hundred leagues in extent, where Mahā Kappina 
once ruled. There were three rivers to cross on the way from Kukkuta to Sāvatthi 
(ThagA.i.507f; Ap.ii.469). See also Kukkutavatī.</p>
<p>3. Kukkuta.-A rock near Himavā. Seven 
Pacceka Buddhas once lived there. ThagA.i.216; Ap.i.178.</p>
