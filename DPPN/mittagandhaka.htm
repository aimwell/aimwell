<p>The child of a decayed family of Sāvatthi. He sent a 
companion to offer marriage to a young girl of good family and the question was 
asked whether he had any friends. The answer being in the negative, he was asked 
to make some. This advice was taken, and he struck up a friendship with the four 
gate keepers and, through them, with the town warders, astrologers, nobles, 
commander in chief, viceroy, king, various monks and, finally, the Buddha 
himself. He therefore came to be known as Mittagandhaka (“man of many friends”). 
The king showed him great favor and arranged for the celebration of his 
marriage. He received numerous presents from people in the highest circles, and 
on the seventh day the young married pair invited the Buddha and five hundred 
monks to a meal at their house. At the end of the meal the Buddha preached to 
them and they became sotāpannas. (J.iv.288f )</p>
<p>The Mahā Ukkusa Jātaka was preached in reference to them.</p>
