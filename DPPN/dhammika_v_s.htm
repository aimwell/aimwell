<p>Dhammika Vagga.-The fifth chapter of the 
Chakka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya. A.iii.344ff.</p>
<p>1. Dhammika Sutta.-Dhammika Thera is 
driven out by the lay disciples of seven settlements in succession, because he 
insulted and reviled visiting monks. He, thereupon, seeks the Buddha at 
Gijjhakūta and reports the matter to him. The Buddha relates to him a story of 
the past connected with the observance of Rukkha-dhamma, and exhorts him to 
observe the dhamma of a recluse. He also tells Dhammika of various teachers of 
the past whose disciples, by accepting their teaching, were born in happy 
states. A.iii.366ff; the teachers are Sunetta, Mūgapakkha, Aranemi, Kuddālaka 
and Jotipāla. These names occur in the Jātakas; see for details. Perhaps the 
stories were pre-Buddhistic. Compare the list with that at A.iv.135, where the 
name of Araka is added.</p>
<p>2. Dhammika Sutta.-Dhammika Upāsaka, 
with five hundred others, visits the Buddha at Jetavana, singing his praises and 
asking what should be the life of a monk and what that of a householder. The 
Buddha proceeds to lay down the course of conduct to be followed by a monk and 
the virtues to be cultivated by a layman (SN.vv.376-404).</p>
<p>The Commentary adds (SNA.i.367f) that 
these upāsakas were all anāgāmīns who, on the day in question, had taken the 
uposatha vows. During the middle watch the question of the difference between 
the life of a monk and that of a layman occurred to them and they sought the 
Buddha.</p>
