<p>v.l. Dīghajayanta</p>
<p>Chief of Elāra’s generals. He was slain 
by Sūranimila (Mhv.xxv.54, 62f). Bhalluka was his nephew (Mhv.xxv.76). He 
offered a red cloth (rattapata) at the Akasacetiya on Sumanagiri. He was born in 
hell, but the sight of the fires there recalled to him his offering and he was 
immediately born in heaven (MA.ii.955; AA.i.375).</p>
