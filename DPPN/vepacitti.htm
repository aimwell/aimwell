  <h2>Vepacitti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An Asura chieftain, who was present with Namuci (Māra) at 
the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.259). It is said that among the 
Asuras, Vepacitti, Rāhu and Pahārada were the chiefs. E.g., AA.ii.758, Vepacitti 
being the highest (sabbajetthaka, SA.i.263).</p>
<p>Vepacitti was the friend of Rāhu, and when Rāhu seized 
Candimā and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to 
Vepacitti that Rāhu fled for comfort (S.i.50, 51). The Asuras being once 
defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and 
brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhammā hall. There Vepacitti 
reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on 
leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mātalī, 
said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool. S.i.221f.; cf. 
S.iv.201, according to which his bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as 
he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the 
Asuras, he felt himself bound. Vepacitti’s capture is referred to in 
Thag.vs.749.</p>
<p>On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory 
should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech. 
Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a 
verse. Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding. Several verses were spoken by 
each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti’s 
verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka 
belonged to one of concord and harmony (S.i.222f). Once, when Sakka was 
revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, 
Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him. “Stop,” said Sakka, “thou art my 
prisoner”; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free 
(S.i.225).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.266) that Vepacitti’s original name 
was Sambara (q.v.). When Sambara refused to give to the seers, who visited him, 
a pledge that the Asuras would not harm them, the seers cursed him, and from 
that time onwards he slept badly and was plagued by nightmares. This so deranged 
his mind (cittam vepati) that he came to be called Vepacitti (“Crazy nerve”). 
When Vepacitti lay ill of this disease, Sakka visited him and offered to cure 
him if he would teach him Sambara’s magic art. Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, 
and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka’s offer, warning him that Sambara, 
having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a 
similar fate (S.i.238f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains that, if Vepacitti had taught him the 
art, it was Sakka’s intention to take Vepacitti to the seers and persuade them 
to forgive him (SA.i.272). This episode seems to contradict Buddhaghosa’s 
previous statement that Sambara and Vepacitti were identical. Perhaps, as Mrs. 
Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.305, n.4), Sambara was the name of an office rather 
than that of a person.</p>
<p>Mention is made (S.i.226) of a visit once paid by Sakka 
and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut. Vepacitti, in his 
buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, 
entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate. 
Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.265) the strange relations of Sakka and Vepacitti by 
saying that they were father&nbsp; and son in law, and that they were sometimes 
at war with each other; sometimes, however, they lived in concord. The 
Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.278 L; cf. J.i.205f ) gives the story of the 
romantic marriage of Sakka to Vepacitti’s daughter, Sujā (q.v.).</p>
<p>According to the Kathā vatthu, other members of 
Vepacitti’s family appear to have intermarried with the devas, and the Kathā 
vatthu Commentary says that a troop of Asuras, belonging to the retinue of 
Vepacitti, was once freed from the fourfold plane of misery and was taken up 
among the devas. See Points of Controversy, p. 211.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit texts call him Vemacitra or Vemacitrī. E.g., 
Dvy., pp. 126, 148; Mtu.iii.138,254.</p>
