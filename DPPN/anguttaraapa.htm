<p>A country north of the river <a href="mahi.htm" title="ma/mahi.htm">Mahī</a>, 
evidently a part of <a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Anga</a> on the other side of that river (Angā eva so janapado; 
Gangāya [Mahāmahīgangāya] pana yā uttarena āpo, tāsam avidūrattā Uttarāpati 
vuccati) (SnA.ii.437).</p>
<p>It was here, in the village <a href="aapana.htm" title="aa/aapana.htm">Āpana</a>, that 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was staying when the
<a href="keniya.htm" title="ku/keniya.htm">Jatila Keniya</a> came to see him; here also was 
preached the <a href="s6_siy.htm#Sela_s" title="s/s6_siy.htm#Sela_s">Sela Sutta</a> (Sn.102f). From
<a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya</a> (in Anga), (DhA.i.384) the 
Buddha went to <a href="anguttaraapa.htm" title="ay/anguttaraapa.htm">Anguttārapa</a> and thence to Āpana (Vin.i.243-5; DhA.iii.363).</p>
<p>The country was probably rich because we 
find as many as 1,250 monks accompanying the Buddha on his tour (Sn.102f).</p>
<p>Other suttas preached here are the 
<a href="potaliya.htm" title="pu/potaliya.htm">Potaliya</a> (M.i.359), and the 
<a href="latukikopama_s.htm" title="l/latukikopama_s.htm">Latukikopama</a> (M.i.447). </p>
<p>Apana seems to have been the chief 
township, because it is always mentioned in connection with Anguttarāpa.</p>
