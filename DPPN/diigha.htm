<hr>
<p>1. Dīgha.-A Yakkha chieftain whose help 
should be sought by followers of the Buddha, when in distress (D.iii.205). The 
Buddha says (M.i.201f ) that Digha once visited him and spoke to him of the 
wonderful attainments of Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila, and remarked how 
fortunate were the Vajjians that these three were dwelling in the Vajji country. 
Buddhaghosa (MA.i.431) describes Digha as a devarājā and says that his other 
name was Parajana. His visit to the Buddha was at Gosingasālavana, just before 
the Buddha left to see Anuruddha and the others.</p>
<p>2. Dīgha.-A thera of Ceylon, and an 
expert in the Vinaya. Vin.v.3.</p>
<p>3. Dīgha.-A brahmin. He found he could 
not satisfy other brahmins, even though he gave five bowls of food to each. One 
day he went to the vihāra, and, in order to test the monks, served them with 
only one vessel of rice. Thirty monks partook of it and Dīgha was pleased with 
their great moderation. AA.i.262f.</p>
