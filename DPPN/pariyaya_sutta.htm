<p>Followers of other teachers might say that their teaching 
was the same as that of the Buddha regarding the five hindrances and the seven 
limbs of wisdom. But there is a method in the teaching of the Buddha whereby 
five become ten and seven fourteen. Other teachers cannot satisfactorily explain 
this method. S.v.108f.</p>
