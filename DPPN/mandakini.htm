<p>One of the seven great lakes of the <a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himālaya</a>. Their names 
are given at J.v.415; A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; DA.i.164; UdA.300; AA.ii.759. At 
Vsm.416, the name Tiyaggalā is substituted for Mandākinī. </p>
<p>It is in the <a href="chaddanta.htm" title="c/chaddanta.htm">Chaddantavana</a> and is fifty leagues in extent, 
of which twenty-five leagues is of crystal water, free from moss or weeds. For 
the next twenty five leagues, the water is but waist deep and is covered with 
white lotus, spreading for half a league around the lake; beyond that are red 
lotus, red lilies, etc., rice fields, fruit trees, a grove of sugar cane — each 
cane being as big as a palm tree banana, jak, mango, rose apple, etc. 
</p>
<p>On the bank of the lake is a spot where Pacceka Buddha’s 
generally live; but <a href="annaa_kondanna.htm" title="ay/annaa_kondanna.htm">Aññā-Kondañña</a> lived there for twelve years attended by Chaddanta, the elephant and Nāgadatta, a devaputta. They ministered to all his 
needs, and he only left there to take leave of the Buddha before his death. He 
then returned to Mandākinī, where he died and was cremated, his relics being 
later deposited at the gateway of Veluvana, where a cetiya was erected over 
them. SA.i.217ff.; but see ThagA.ii.3, where he is said to have lived on the 
bank of the Chaddantadaha; Mandākinī may have been another name for the same 
lake. </p>
<p>The Mandākinī Lake never grows hot and dries up only at 
the end of the kappa. SNA.ii.407.</p>
