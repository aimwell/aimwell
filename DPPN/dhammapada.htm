  <h2>Dhammapada</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The second book of the Khuddaka Nikāya 
of the Sutta Pitaka. </p>
<p>It is probably a later anthology than 
the Thera-Therī-Gāthā, and its earliest mention by name is in the Milinda-pañha 
(p.408). </p>
<p>It includes gāthas collected together 
from various books in the Canon, but contains hardly any from the Jātaka 
collection, or directly derived from the Sutta Nipāta.</p>
<p>The present text of the Dhammapada 
contains four hundred and twenty-three verses divided into twenty-six vaggas.
</p>
<p>So far, five recensions of the 
Dhammapada have been discovered. (For details see Law: Pāli Lit., pp.215f).
</p>
<p>A commentary on it exists called the 
Dhammapadatthakathā.</p>
