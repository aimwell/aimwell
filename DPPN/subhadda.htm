<hr>
<p><b><a name=5></a>5. Subhadda. </b>A barber of Atumā. He entered the 
Order and resented having to observe various rules, great and small. When the 
Buddha died and the monks stood weeping, Subhadda asked them to rejoice instead, 
saying: “We are well rid of the Mahāsamana; we shall now do just as we like.” 
Mahā Kassapa heard this while he was on his way from Pāvā to Kusināra, and it 
was this remark which made him decide to hold the First Council after the 
Buddha’s death (Vin.ii.284f; D.ii.162; Mhv.iii.6).</p>
<p>Subhadda had been a sāmanera at the time of the Buddha’s 
visit to Atumā, and had two sons before he joined the Order. When he heard that 
the Buddha was coming, he sent for his two sons and gave orders for various 
foods to be collected to feed the Buddha and the twelve hundred and fifty monks. 
The Buddha arrived in the evening and took up his residence in Atumā. All night 
long Subhadda went about giving instructions regarding the preparation of the 
food. In the morning of the next day the Buddha went out for alms, and Subhadda 
approached him and invited him to partake of the food which he had prepared. But 
the Buddha questioned him, and, discovering what he had done, refused to accept 
the meal, forbidding the monks to do so too. This angered Subhadda, and he 
awaited an opportunity of expressing his disapproval of the Buddha. This 
opportunity came when he heard of the Buddha’s death. DA.ii.599; cf. Vin.i.249f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name=6></a>6. Subhadda Thera. </b>He was a brahmin of high rank 
(of the udicca-brāhmana-mahā-sālakula), and, having become a Paribbājaka, was 
living in Kusinārā when the Buddha went there on his last journey. Having heard 
that the Buddha would die in the third watch of the night, Subhadda went to the 
sāla grove, where the Buddha lay on his death bed, and asked Ānanda for 
permission to see him. But three times Ānanda refused the request, saying that 
the Buddha was weary. The Buddha overheard the conversation and asked Subhadda 
to come in. Subhadda asked the Buddha if there were any truth in the teachings 
of other religious instructors. The Buddha said he had no time to discuss that, 
but that any system devoid of the Noble Eightfold Path was useless for 
salvation, and he taught Subhadda the Doctrine. Subhadda asked to be allowed to 
join the Order, and the Buddha gave Ānanda  special permission to admit him at 
once without waiting for the usual probationary period. Subhadda dwelt in 
solitude and in meditation and soon became an arahant. He was the last disciple 
to be converted by the Buddha (D.ii.148ff.; cf. DhA.iii.376f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.590) that when the Buddha gave him 
permission to ordain Subhadda, Ānanda took him outside, poured water over his 
head, made him repeat the formula of the impermanence of the body, shaved off 
his hair and beard, clad him in yellow robes, made him repeat the Three Refuges, 
and then led him back to the Buddha. The Buddha himself admitted Subhadda to the 
higher ordination and gave him a subject for meditation. Subhadda took this and, 
walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, attained arahantship and came 
and sat down beside the Buddha.</p>
<p>In the past, Subhadda and Aññāta Kondañña had been 
brothers. They had a cornfield, and the elder (Aññāta Kondañña) gave the first 
fruits of the corn to the monks in nine stages. The younger (Subhadda) found 
fault with him for damaging the corn. They then divided the field, thus settling 
the dispute (DA.ii.588). Subhadda rubbed the dead body of Padumuttara Buddha 
with sandalwood and other fragrant essences and placed a banner on his thūpa. In 
the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Buddha’s aggasāvaka, Tissa, was, Subhadda’s son. 
Subhadda spoke disparagingly of him, hence his tardiness in meeting the Buddha 
in his last life. Subhadda died on the day of his ordination and arahantship 
(Ap.i.100f).</p>
<p>The conversation between the Buddha and Subhadda forms the 
topic of a dilemma in the Milinda-Pañha (p.130). Subhadda’s ordination was the 
Buddha’s last “official” act. KhA.,p.89.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name=7></a>7. Subhadda.</b> A lay disciple of Nātikā. He was an 
anāgāmī and was born in the Suddhavāsā, never to be reborn. D.ii.92; S.v.348f.</p>
