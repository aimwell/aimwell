<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at the
<a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">Migārāmatupāsāda</a> and asks him how a monk can be delivered by the extirpation of 
cravings and become foremost among gods and men. The Buddha briefly explains, 
and Sakka leaves him after expressing his satisfaction.  </p>

<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a>, desiring to 
know if Sakka has really understood the teaching, visits him and asks him the 
same question. Sakka evades this question and, accompanied by 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a>, 
conducts Moggallāna through his palace, <a href="vejayanta.htm" title="vy/vejayanta.htm">Vejayanta</a>, in order to demonstrate his 
power. Moggallāna causes the palace to quake and, seeing the agitation of Sakka, 
again asks him the same question; Sakka gives the Buddha’s explanation, word for 
word, and Moggallāna is satisfied. M.i.251ff</p>
