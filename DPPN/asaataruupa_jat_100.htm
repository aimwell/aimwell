<p>Once the Bodhisatta was King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. 
The Kosala king waged war on him, slew him and bore off his queen to make her 
his own wife. The king’s son escaped through a sewer and later came back with a 
large army to give battle. His mother, hearing of his doings, suggested that he 
should blockade the city instead.</p>
<p>This he did, and the blockade was so 
close that on the seventh day the people cut off the head of the king and 
brought it to the prince.</p>
<p>It was this prince who became <a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sīvalī</a> in 
the present age; the blockade was the reason for his remaining seven years in 
his mother’s womb, and for her being seven days in bringing him forth. His 
mother was <a href="suppavaasaa.htm" title="s/suppavaasaa.htm">Suppavāsā</a>, daughter of the Koliya king.</p>
<p>The story was related by the Buddha to 
explain to the monks the reason for <a href="suppavaasaa.htm" title="s/suppavaasaa.htm">Suppavāsā’s</a> long pregnancy. J.i.407-10. This 
Jātaka appears, with variations in detail, in DhA.ii.198ff.</p>
