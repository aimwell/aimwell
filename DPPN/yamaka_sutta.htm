<p>The Thera Yamaka held the view that, in so far as a monk 
has destroyed the āsavas, he is broken up and perishes at the break up of the 
body and becomes not after death. Yamaka’s colleagues tried to correct this 
erroneous view (the heresy lies in the implication that “a being is broken up 
and perishes”; SA.ii.226.) but failed, and so reported him to Sāriputta. 
Sāriputta visited Yamaka and argued with him that if it were false to say of 
anybody that he existed in truth, in reality, even in this very life, how much 
more so to speak of someone existing or not existing after death. Yamaka 
thereupon confessed his error. Sāriputta further elucidated the matter by using 
the simile of a man who enters the service of a rich householder with the intent 
to murder him. Such a man would always be a murderer, even though his master 
knew him not to be so. Even so, the disciple who regards body, etc., as 
permanent and so on, harbours a murderous view, even though he knows it not as 
such (S.iii.109ff). </p>
<p>The sutta is often referred to. (E.g., VibhA.32; Vsm.479; 
cp. Vsm.626 (Yamakato sammasana). Does Yamakato here mean “according to the 
Yamaka Sutta“?). </p>
<p>It is sometimes called the 
Yamakovāda Sutta (E.g., Netti, p. 30).</p>
