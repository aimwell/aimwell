<p>A poor woman of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. She saw the 
Buddha going on his begging round, and having nothing else to offer, gave him, 
with very pious heart, some dried flesh, old and salt less. </p>
<p>She thought constantly of her gift, and 
after death was born in a vimāna in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>, where 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> came across her 
and heard her story from her (v.l. Ālomā). Vv.39; VvA.184.</p>
