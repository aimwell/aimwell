when the Buddha announced that he would die in four months, a large number of 
monks wandered about distracted, in small groups, not knowing where to turn. But 
Dhammārāma dwelt apart, meditating. This was reported to the Buddha and, on 
being questioned, Dhammārāma confessed that he wished to become an arahant while 
yet the Buddha was alive. The Buddha praised him and asked the other monks to 
follow his example. DhA.iv.93ff.</p>
