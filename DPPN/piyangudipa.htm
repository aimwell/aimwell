<p>An island, probably near Ceylon, the monks of which 
enjoyed a reputation for extreme holiness. When Dutthagāmanī, fleeing from 
Cūlanganiyapitthi, wished to give alms though having so little food, an arahant 
Thera came from Piyangudīpa to accept it as soon as the time of the almsgiving 
was announced by the minister Tissa (Mhv.xxiv.24ff). Again, when Dutthagāmanī, 
after his conquest of the Damilas, was filled with remorse for his slaughter of 
men, arahants of Piyangudīpa read his thoughts and came to console him 
(Mhv.xxv.104ff). Mention is made of as many as twelve thousand monks living on 
Piyangudīpa. Mhv.xxxii.55.</p>
