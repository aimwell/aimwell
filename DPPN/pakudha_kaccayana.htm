  <h2>Pakudha Kaccāyana </h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>(Pakudha Kātiyāna, Kakudha Kaccāyana, Kakuda Kātiyāna)</p>
<p>Head of one of the six heretical sects of the Buddha’s 
time. In the <a href="samannaphala_s.htm" title="sa/samannaphala_s.htm">Sāmaññaphala Sutta</a> (D.i.56),
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātassattu</a> is said to have visited 
him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect 
that the four elements — earth, fire, air, 
water; pleasure, pain, and the soul — these 
seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that 
there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, 
therefore, one of non action (akiriya vāda). When one, with a sharp sword, 
cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely 
penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances (cf. the 
doctrine of the Cartesians, that there is no sin in taking the life of lower 
animals because they have no soul). In other words, there is no such act as 
killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction 
between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.</p>
<p>Pakudha’s teachings are also referred to in the 
<a href="sandaka_sutta.htm" title="sa/sandaka_sutta.htm">Sandaka 
Sutta</a> (M.i.517), and there described at even greater length, but here his name 
is not mentioned.</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> adds (DA.i.144) that Pakudha avoided the use 
of cold water, using always hot; when this was not available, he did not wash. 
If he crossed a stream he would consider this as a sin, and would make expiation 
by constructing a mound of earth. This is evidence of the ascetic tendency in 
his teaching on matters of external conduct. His teaching is, however, described 
as nissirikaladdhi.</p>
<p>We are told (M.i.250; ii.4) that Pakudha’s followers did 
not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by 
his followers. Pakudha did not welcome questions, and displayed annoyance and 
resentment when cross examined. Elsewhere (E.g., M.i.198; S.i.66; SN.p.91) 
however, he is spoken of as having been highly honoured by the people, a teacher 
of large and well reputed schools, with numerous followers. But he did not lay 
claim to perfect enlightenment (S.i.68).</p>
<p>Pakudha Kaccāyana’s name is spelt in several ways. Some 
texts give his personal name as Kakudha, or Kakuda. In the Prasnopanisad (Barus: 
Prebuddhistic Indian Philosophy, 281; see also Dvy.143; Mtu.i.253, 256, 259; 
iii.383) mention is made of a Kakuda Kātyāna, a younger contemporary of 
Pippalāda. There he is called Kabandhin, which name, like Kakuda, means that he 
had a hump on his neck or shoulder.  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.144; SA.i.102) that Pakudha was his personal name and Kaccāyana that of his gotta. The Kaccāyana (or 
Kātiyāna, as it is sometimes called) was a brahmin gotta.</p>
<p>Pakudha is mentioned as having been, in a past life, one 
of the five ditthigatikas mentioned in the 
<a href="mahabodhi_jat_528.htm" title="maha/mahabodhi_jat_528.htm">Mahābodhi Jātaka</a> (J.v.246). He is 
also mentioned in the <a href="milindapanha.htm" title="me_mu/milindapanha.htm">Milindapañha</a> as one of the teachers visited by 
<a href="milinda.htm" title="me_mu/milinda.htm">Milinda</a>. 
The whole account is either a plagiarism of the Sāmaññaphala Sutta or else the 
teachers referred to only belonged to the same respective schools of thought.</p>
