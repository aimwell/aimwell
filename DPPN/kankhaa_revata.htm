  <h2>Kankhā-Revata Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a very wealthy family in 
Sāvatthi. One day, after his midday meal, he went with others to hear the Buddha 
preach and, accepting the word of the Buddha, he entered the Order. According to 
the Apadāna (ii.491), he heard the Buddha preach at Kapilavatthu.</p>
<p>He attained arahantship by way of 
practising jhāna, and so proficient in jhāna did he become that the Buddha 
declared him chief of the monks who practised it (A.i.24; Ud.v.9; AA.i.129f; 
Thag.3; ThagA.33f). Before he became an arahant he was greatly troubled in mind 
as to what was permissible for him to use and what was not (akappiyā muggā, na 
kappanti muggā paribhuñjitum, etc.). This characteristic of his became well 
known, hence his name (UdA.314).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara he was a 
brahmin of Hamsavatī, well versed in the Vedas. One day, while listening to the 
Buddha’s preaching, he heard him declare a monk in the assembly as chief among 
those who practised jhāna, and himself wished for the same honour under a future 
Buddha (Ap.ii.419f). He is often mentioned in company with other very eminent 
disciples — e.g., Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, Kundadhāna and Ānanda — at the 
preaching of the Nalakapāna Sutta (M.i.462). The Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212ff) 
records a discussion between Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata and 
Ānanda, and there we find Revata praising, as the highest type of monk, one who 
delights in meditation and has his habitation in the abodes of solitude.</p>
<p>Kankhā-Revata appears to have survived 
the Buddha.</p>
<p>In the Uttaramātu-peta Vatthu 
(PvA.141ff), Uttara’s mother having been born as a peta, and having wandered 
about for fifty-five years without water, came upon Revata enjoying the siesta 
on the banks of the Ganges and begged him for succor. Having learnt her story, 
Revata gave various gifts to the Sangha in her name, and so brought her 
happiness.</p>
