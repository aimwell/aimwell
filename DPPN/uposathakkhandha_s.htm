  <h2>Uposathakkhandha Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the discourses occurring in the 
Uposathakhandha. It is quoted in the Atthasālinī as authority that might be used 
by any opponent to prove that an immoral act of speech also arises in the 
mind-door. </p>
<p>The Commentary proceeds to explain how 
this argument could be refuted (DhsA.92f).</p>
