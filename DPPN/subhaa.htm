<p><b>1. Subhā.</b> A group of Brahmās; the group includes 
the Parittasubhā, the Appamānasubhā and the Subhakinhā. M.iii.102.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Subhā Kammāradhītā.</b> She was the daughter of a 
rich goldsmith of Rājagaha. One day she went to pay obeisance to the Buddha and 
he preached to her. She became a sotāpanna, and later she joined the Order under 
Mahā Pajāpatī. From time to time her relations tried to persuade her to leave 
the Order and return to the world. One day she set forth, in twenty four verses, 
the dangers of household life and dismissed them, convinced of her rightness. 
Then, striving for insight, she attained arahantship on the eighth day 
(Thig.vs.338-61). The Buddha saw this and praised her in three verses 
(Thig.vs.362-4). Sakka visited her with the gods of Tāvatimsa and uttered 
another verse in her praise. ThigA.365; ThigA.236f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Subhā Jīvakambavanikā. </b>She belonged to an 
eminent brahmin family of Rājagaha, and, seeing the bane in the pleasures of 
sense, became a nun under Pajāpatī Gotamī. She was called Subhā because her body 
was beautiful. One day, in Jīvakambavana, a libertine, in the prime of youth, 
seeing her going to her siesta, stopped her, inviting her to sensual pleasures. 
She talked to him of the evils of such pleasures, but he persisted. Seeing that 
he was particularly enamoured of the beauty of her eyes, she pulled out one of 
them, saying: “Come, here is the offending eye.” The man was appalled and asked 
her forgiveness. Subhā went to the Buddha, and, at sight of him, her eye 
recovered.</p>
<p>Filled with joy, she stood worshipping him, and he taught 
her and gave her an exercise for meditation. She developed insight and became an 
arahant. Thig.vss.366-399; ThigA.245f.</p>
