<p><b>1. Vetambarī. </b>One of a group of devas who visited 
the Buddha at Veluvana and spoke of their beliefs. Vetambarī spoke two verses, 
one condemning asceticism, and the other, which followed immediately on the 
first, in praise of the same (S.i.65, 67). The Commentary says (SA.i.100) that 
the second verse was inspired by Māra.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vetambarī. </b>The name of Buddhūpatthāyaka’s father 
in his birth thirty one kappas ago. Ap.i.242.</p>
