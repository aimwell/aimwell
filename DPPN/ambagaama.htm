<p>1. Ambagāma.-A village in Ceylon near 
Pulatthipura identified with the modern Ambagamuva. A battle was fought there 
between the forces of Gajabāhu and Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxx.321) Parakkamabāhu 
II. built a bridge, thirty-four cubits in length, over the Khajjotanadī at 
Ambagāma. Ibid., lxxxvi.23.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Ambagāma.-One of the villages near 
Vesāli visited by the Buddha on his last tour (D.ii.123). It was between 
Bhandagāma and Bhoganagara, on the road from Vesāli to Kusināra. This was 
evidently the road which led from Vesāli northwards to the Malla Country, for 
other villages in the vicinity of Ambagāma were Hatthigāma and Jambugāma.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Anupiya, although 
in the Malla country, is not mentioned in the list of these villages. Thomas 
(Op. cit., 148, n.1) thinks that this is because the route to Kusināra passed to 
the east of Anupiya.</p>
