  <h2>Nālaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Nephew of Asita (Kāladevala). When Asita realized that he 
would not live to see the Buddha, he sought out Nālaka and asked him to leave 
the world at once and become an ascetic and hold himself in readiness to profit 
by the Buddha’s Enlightenment.  </p>
<p>This Nālaka did, though possessing eighty 
thousand crores of wealth, and he spent his time in Himavā. When the time came, 
he visited the Buddha seven days after the Buddha’s first sermon and questioned 
him on the Moneyyapatipadā (also called the Nālakapatipadā, because it is 
included in the Nālaka Sutta). Nālaka retired once more into Himavā and there 
attained arahantship. There he spent seven months leaning against a golden rock, 
practising patipadā in its highest form. After his death the Buddha, with his 
monks, visited the scene of his death, cremated his remains, and had a cetiya 
built over them.</p>
<p>It is said that Nālaka’s aspiration to learn and practise 
the Moneyyapatipadā was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. J.i.55; 
SNA.ii.483ff., 501. The story as drawn from Tibetan sources differs greatly from 
this story. (See, e.g. Rockhill: op. cit., p. 18, 45 f). In the Mahāvastu 
(iii.380, 387) he is called Kātyāyana.</p>
