<p><b>1. Sangha. </b>An astrologer (samvacckarikanāyaka) who 
predicted the destiny of Kitti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.). It was this 
prediction which made Buddharāja support Kitti. Cv.lvii.48.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sangha.</b> Father of Sūranimmila; he was the father 
of seven sons and lived in Khandavitthika. Mhv.xxiii.19.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sangha.</b> An upāsaka who will wait on Metteyya 
Buddha (Anāgat. vs. 61) and be his chief lay patron. Ibid., 98.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sangha</b>. A minister of 
Dutthagāmanī. He gave alms, in circumstances that won applause from the deity of 
the king’s parasol, to Mahānāga Thera of Kotagallapabbata, to a monk of 
Timbarugāma, and to another of Devagirivihāra and Cetiyapabbata. The king sent 
for him and made him Treasurer. It is probably this same Sangha that is 
mentioned in the Extended Mahāvamsa (xxxii.246) as destined to become the chief 
patron of Matteyya Budda. His wife was Sanghadattā (q.v.). Ras.ii.75f, 180.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sangha</b>. A minister of 
Kākavannatissa; his brother was Cullasangha and his daughter Kiñcisanghā. When 
the latter was taught cooking, the first meal she made was given to the monks. 
Thus she came to be called Sanghupatthāyikā. Later, she was abandoned by her 
parents at Nigrodhasālakhanda, but she was rescued by Sakka in the guise of a 
youth. She gave alms to a monk of Cittalapabbāta when she had been starving for 
seven days, and also gave her only garment, herself wearing leaves. The king 
heard of this from the deity of his parasol, and, having sent for her, gave her 
in marriage to one of his sons. Ras.ii.45f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Sangha Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells Upāli of ten things 
which disunite the Order and their ten opposites which unite it. A.v.73.</p>
