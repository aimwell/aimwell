<h4>1. Pārāsariya Thera</h4>
<p>A brahmin of Rājagaha, expert in the three Vedas. He 
belonged to the family of Pārāsara, hence his name. He was a teacher of many 
brahmins up to the time of his witnessing the miracles attending the Buddha’s 
visit to Rājagaha. Thereupon he joined the Order and shortly after became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Piyadasī Buddha he was a hunter, and while 
hunting in the forest, he saw the Buddha in meditation, and erected a hut over 
him, covering it with lilies. For seven days he renewed the supply of flowers. 
On the seventh day a large concourse of humans and devas assembled to hear the 
Buddha preach. The hunter listened to the sermon, and was born after death in 
the deva world (Thag.vs.116; ThagA.i.229 ff). He is probably identical with 
Padumakūtāgārlya of the Apadāna (Ap.i.326ff). v.l. Pārāpariya.</p>

<h4>2. Pārāsariya</h4>
<p>A brahmin teacher mentioned in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta. 
He is said, by his pupil Uttara, to have taught that those who have developed 
their indriyas could neither see forms with their eyes nor hear sounds with 
their ears (M.iii.298). He is perhaps identical with Pārāpariya Thera.</p>

<h4>3. Pārāsariya</h4>
<p>A brahmin teacher of Takkasilā, mentioned in the 
Cūlānandiya Jātaka. J.ii.202.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Pārāsariya</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a teacher of Takkasilā (J.iii.160). 
His family name was Pārāsariya (Ibid., 161). For details see the Dhonasākha 
Jātaka.</p>
