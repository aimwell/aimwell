<p><b>1. Rohana. </b>Grandfather of Migāra Rohaneyya (q.v.). AA.ii.697.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Rohana.</b> A brahmin, grandson of Pekkhuniya. He was a friend of the 
Licchavi Sālha, and a visit paid by both of them to Nandaka is recorded in the 
Anguttara Nikāya. A.i.193f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Rohana.</b> A Sākiyan prince, one of the brothers of Bhaddakaccānā. He 
went over to Ceylon and there founded a settlement which was named after him. 
Mhv.ix.10; Dpv.x.6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Rohana.</b> One of the three main provinces of early Ceylon comprising 
the south eastern part of the island, the Mahāvālukanadī forming its northern 
boundary. It was probably colonized by Rohana (3). The capital of the province 
was Mahāgāma. When the northern parts of the island were in the hands of 
foreigners or usurpers, the Singhalese court, its nobles and loyalists, often 
sought refuge in Rohana. It seems, for the most part, to have been very little 
controlled from the capital, and many rebellions against the ruler of the 
capital originated in Rohana. See Dutthagāmani and Vijayabāhu; also, e.g., 
Mhv.xxiii.13; xxxiii.37; xxxv.27f., 67, 125; Cv.xxxviii.12, 39; xli.89ff.; 
xliv.54; xlviii.59, etc. </p>
<p>In times of persecution and scarcity the Buddhist monks found patronage and 
shelter among the inhabitants of Rohana (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6). Even till about 
600 A.C., Rohana was regarded as a separate kingdom, holding, or at least 
claiming to hold, an independent position beside Anurādhapura (See, e.g., 
Cv.xlv.41).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Rohana.</b> See Rohanta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Rohana Thera. </b>When Assagutta summoned the heads of the Order to a 
conference regarding the heresy of Milinda, Rohana was lost in meditation, and a 
messenger had to be sent to fetch him. As punishment for this, he was charged 
with the task of persuading Nāgasena to join the Order. To achieve this purpose, 
Rohana had to visit the house of Nāgasena’s father, Sonuttara, during seven 
years and ten months, without ever receiving even a kind word, till, at last, 
one day Sonuttara was pleased with his kindness and courtesy and gave him food 
daily at the house. When Nāgasena grew up and learnt the Vedas, Rohana engaged 
him in discussion, as a result of which Nāgasena joined the Order under Rohana, 
who, as his first preceptor, taught him the Abhidhamma. One day, Nāgasena 
thought lightly of his teacher, and Rohana, reading his thoughts, chided him. 
Nāgasena begged his forgiveness, but Rohana said he would forgive him only if he 
succeeded in refuting Milinda’s heretical views. Mil. 7ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Rohana. </b>Headman of the village of Kitti and father of 
Theraputtābhaya. Rohana was a supporter of Mahāsumma Thera, and, having heard 
him preach at the Kotapabbata vihāra, he became a sotāpanna and joined the 
Order, later attaining arahantship. Mhv.xxiii.55ff.</p>
