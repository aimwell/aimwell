  <h2>Kālingabodhi Jātaka (No.479)</h2>

<p>The Kālinga king of Dantapura had two 
sons, Mahā Kālinga and Culla Kālinga. Soothsayers foretold that the younger 
would be an ascetic, but that his son would be a Cakka-vatti. Knowing of this 
prophecy, Culla Kālinga became so arrogant that Mahā Kālinga, on coming to the 
throne, ordered his arrest. But Culla Kālinga fled to Himavā and lived there as 
an ascetic. Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled 
with their daughter from their city of Sāgala. Soothsayers had predicted that 
the princess’s son would be a Cakka-vatti, and all the kings of Jambudīpa sought 
her hand. Her parents, not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings, fled 
with her from the city. One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess 
dropped into the river was picked up by Culla Kālinga, who thereupon went in 
search of her. With her parents' consent he married her, and to these two was 
born a son whom they called Kālinga.  </p>
<p>When the stars revealed that Mahā Kālinga 
had died, Kālinga was sent to Dantapura, to a courtier who had been an ally of 
Culla Kālinga. The prince’s identity having been duly established, he was 
crowned king, and his chaplain, Kālinga-bhāradvāja, taught him the duties of a 
Cakka-vatti. On the fifteenth day after his coronation, the tokens of a 
Cakka-vatti king appeared before him. (For details see J.iv.232). One day while 
riding through the air with his retinue, he came to the Bodhi-tree under which 
Buddhas attain Enlightenment, and though he prodded his elephant until it died 
the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot. The royal chaplain 
investigated matters and reported his finding to the king who, having learnt 
from the chaplain of a Buddha’s virtues, paid great honour to the tree for seven 
days. See also Samanakolañña.</p>
<p>Kālinga is identified with Ānanda and 
Kālinga-bhāradvāja with the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the Bodhi-tree planted, at Ānanda’s suggestion, by Anāthapindika, at the 
entrance to Jetavana, in order that people might worship it while the Buddha was 
away on tour. As soon as a seedling was planted from the great Bodhi-tree at 
Gayā, it grew into a tree fifty cubits high, and the Buddha consecrated it by 
spending one night under it, wrapt in meditation (J.iv.228-36).</p>
<p>The Kālingabodhi Jātaka is found also in 
the Mahābodhi-vamsa (Mbv.62ff ); there it is given in much greater detail and 
differs in minor details from the Jātaka version, containing, among other 
things, a long description of dibba-cakkhu and the seven gems of a Cakka-vatti.</p>
