  <h2>Khaggavisāna Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The third sutta of the Uraga Vagga of 
the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a> (SN.vv.35-75), consisting of forty-one stanzas, each of which 
ends with the refrain: “eko care khaggavisānakappo.”  </p>
<p>The Commentary (SNA.i.46ff) 
divides the sutta into four vaggas and gives each a separate name (except the 
first), the name being generally derived from the first word of the stanza. It 
is said that the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> preached the Khaggavisāna Sutta in response to a 
question asked of him by <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> regarding the attainment of Enlightenment by 
Pacceka Buddhas; the Buddha gave details of their abhinīhara and patthanā, and 
illustrated them by reciting to Ānanda stanzas which had been uttered by Pacceka 
Buddhas of old on various occasions and at different periods as their paeans of 
joy (udāna).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa gives the life-story of each 
of the Pacceka Buddhas whose stanzas are included in this sutta. It is, however, 
only in the case of a few Pacceka Buddhas that the actual names are given — 
e.g.,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Brahmadatta (v.33), </li>
  <li>Anitthigandha (36), </li>
  <li>Mahāpaduma (39), 
  </li>
  <li>Ekavajjika-Brahmadatta (40), </li>
  <li>Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta (41), 
  </li>
  <li>Cātumāsika-Brahma-datta (44, 64), </li>
  <li>Sītāluka-Brahmadatta (52), </li>
  <li>Suta-Brahmadatta 
(58), </li>
  <li>Vibhūsaka-Brahmadatta (59), </li>
  <li>Pādalola-Brahmadatta (61), 
  </li>
  <li>Anivatta-Brahmadatta (62), </li>
  <li>Cakkhulola-Brahmadatta (63),</li>
  <li>Mātanga (74).</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest are described as “the king of 
Benares,” or “the son of the king,” etc.</p>
<p>The sutta is commented on in the 
Culla-Niddesa (pp.56ff), in addition to those of the Parāyanavagga, an evidence 
of the fact that, when the Culla-Niddesa was composed, this was probably 
regarded as an independent sutta, not belonging to any particular group such as 
the Uragavagga, and that the comments on it were written at a time prior to the 
composition of the Sutta Nipāta as an anthology in its present form. This view 
is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the 
Mahāvastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group. According to the 
Mahāvastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in 
Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddhāvāsa devas of the 
approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each 
repeating one of the verses of the sutta.</p>
<p>The Apadāna (i.7ff) includes the stanzas 
of the Khaggavisāna Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddhāpadāna and 
prefaces them with several introductory stanzas. A few stanzas are also added at 
the end by way of conclusion. In its exegesis the Apadāna Commentary 
(ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas. They are, however, 
different from those given by Buddhaghosa, and correspond more nearly to those&nbsp; 
mentioned in the <a href="isigili_s.htm" title="i_/isigili_s.htm">Isigili Sutta</a>.</p>
