<p><b>1. Bhaddiya Sutta</b>. Records the visit of the 
  Licchavi Bhaddiya to the Buddha and also their conversation. A.ii.190ff.</p>

</p>
<p>Though hunchbacked and unsightly, yet, says the Buddha, he 
was highly gifted, of a lofty nature, having achieved his goal. Even a puny boy, 
if wise, is truly great, feared by men as the lion is by animals. S.ii.279.</p>

<p><b>3. Bhaddiya Sutta</b></p>
<p>The Buddha tells Bhaddiya Thera (2) that the Noble

<ul>
  <li>unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, </li>
  <li>to the Dhamma, </li>
  <li>to the Sangha, </li>
  <li>and virtues; that are dear to the Noble Ones. 
  </li>
</ul>
