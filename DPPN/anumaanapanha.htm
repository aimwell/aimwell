  <h2>AnumÄnapaÃ±ha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most famous chapters of the 
Milinda PaÃ±a (329-47). </p>
<p>It deals with the problem of inferring 
the existence of the Buddha from facts known about him and connected with him.
</p>
<p>It also includes a description of the 
City of Righteousness – Dhammanagara â€” the Buddhist Utopia, and gives an 
excellent idea of city life at the time the chapter was written.</p>
