<p>When a young wife is first led home she is full of fear 
and bashfulness, not only towards her relations but also towards the servants. 
So is a monk who has just entered homelessness full of fear and bashfulness, 
even before novices of the monastery. As time goes on, this feeling, in both 
cases, gives place to boldness. But a monk should always be like a newly wed 
wife. A.ii.78f.</p>
