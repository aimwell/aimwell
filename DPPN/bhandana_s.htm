<p><b>1. Bhandana Sutta</b>. The Buddha says it is unpleasant for him even to think of 
a place where monks are given to dispute, but far worse to go to it. Strife is 
due to the abandonment of dispassionate, benevolent and harmless thinking. Monks 
who dwell in harmony cultivate these things. A.i.275f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhandana Sutta</b>. Five disadvantages which come 
  to those who encourage strife and disputes. A.iii.252.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhandana Sutta.</b> The Buddha rebukes some monks 
  at Jetavana who were engaged in disputation and tells them to reflect on ten 
  things which conduce to kindness, peace and concord. A.v.88 ff.</p>
