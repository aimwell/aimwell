<p>A famine in the mountain-region of Kotta 
in Ceylon, during the reign of Dutthagāmini. </p>
<p>The king sold his earrings and procured 
a meal for five khīnāsava theras (Mhv.xxxii.29-30). The famine was so called 
because nuts called akkha (Terminalia Bellerica) were eaten, which at other 
times were used as dice. In the Atthakathā, quoted by the Mahāvamsa Tīkā 
(p.593), the famine is called Pāsānachātaka.</p>
