  <h2>Sātimattiya Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Magadha and, after 
entering the Order, lived in the forest and developed the six fold abhiññā. 
Thereupon he instructed monks and preached to large numbers of lay people. One 
family in particular he converted to the Faith, and in that family he was waited 
on respectfully by a beautiful girl. Māra, wishing to disgrace him, once went to 
the house disguised as the Elder, and grasped the girl’s hand. But she, feeling 
that the touch was not human, took her hand away. The others, however, saw this 
and lost faith in the Thera. He, all unconscious, was aware next day of their 
changed manner. Discerning the work of Māra, he made them tell him what had 
happened. The father begged his forgiveness, and said that henceforth he himself 
would wait on the Elder (ThagA.i.368 f.; verses ascribed to him are found in 
Thag.246 8).</p>
<p>The Thera is evidently identical with Sumanatālavantiya of 
the Apadāna (Ap.ii.408). Ninety four kappas ago he met Siddhattha Buddha and 
offered him a palmyra fan (tālavanta) covered with sumana flowers.</p>
