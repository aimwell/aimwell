<p>It were a good thing if the sense organs 
were seared with a red-hot iron, for then there would be no grasping of marks or 
details of objects cognizable by the senses. It were a good thing to be asleep, 
for then the mind would not be applied to evil ends. But it were better to 
ponder on the impermanence of the sense organs, their sensations, the 
consciousness and the contacts connected with them and all that has to do with 
the mind, because that pondering would produce repulsion and dispassion, freedom 
and realisation of freedom. S.iv.168f.</p>
