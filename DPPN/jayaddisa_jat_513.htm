<p>Twice the sons of Pañcāla, king of 
Kampilla, were devoured by an ogress who had conceived a hatred for his queen. 
On the third occasion the ogress was chased by the palace guard before she could 
eat the child, but she succeeded in snatching him away and brought him up as her 
own. He grew up to be a man-eating ogre and dwelt in a tree. The fourth son of 
Pañcāla was Jayaddisa, who succeeded his father.</p>
<p>The ogress had died before his birth. He 
had a son Alīnasattu.</p>
<p>One day Jayaddisa ordered a hunt, but 
just as he was about to start out, Nanda, a brahmin from Takkasilā, brought him 
four verses worth one hundred each. Jayaddisa ordered a dwelling to be made for 
him and declared that he on whose side the deer escaped should pay for the 
verses. An antelope made straight for the king and escaped. The king pursued and 
killed it, but while on his way back with the carcase he came to the ogre’s 
dwelling place and was promptly claimed as his prey. Remembering his promise to 
pay Nanda, Jayaddisa persuaded the ogre to let him go on condition that he would 
return when he had paid for the verses. Alīnasattu, hearing of this, offered to 
go in his father’s place and this was allowed. He won over the ogre by his 
fearlessness, taught him the moral law and, suspecting that the ogre was his 
father’s elder brother, proved the relationship with the help of an ascetic 
gifted with supernatural vision. Jayaddisa, informed of this, made a settlement 
for the ogre which came to be called Cullakammāsadamma.</p>
<p>The ogre was Angulimāla and Alīnasattu 
the Bodhisatta (J.v.21-30).</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk who supported his mother; for details see the Sāma Jātaka. The story of 
Jayaddisa is included in the Cariyāpitaka (ii.9).</p>
