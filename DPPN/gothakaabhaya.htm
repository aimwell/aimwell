<p>1. Gothakābhaya, Gothābhaya.-A king of 
the Rohana dynasty; son of Yatthālayakatissa and father of Kākavannatissa 
(Mhv.xv.170; xxii.11). He is sometimes called Abhaya. E.g., Mhv.xxiii.10, 56.</p>
<p>2. Gothakābhaya.-King of Ceylon (302-15 
A.C.). He was a Lambakanna of Mahiyangana, and having gone to Anurādhapura with 
Sanghatissa and Sanghabodhi, he, with their help, slew the reigning king, Vijaya, 
and they reigned in succession (Mhv.xxxvi.58). Gothakābhaya became Sanghabodhi’s 
treasurer but, seeing the king’s weakness, he led a rebellion against him and 
captured the throne (vv.91, 98-117; for details see Sanghabodhi). In addition to 
other religious works, he built the Meghavannābhaya-Vihāra. He banished from 
Abhayagiri sixty monks who had accepted the Vetulla heresy, but a Cola monk, 
Sanghamitta, defeated in discussion the thera Gothābhaya, the king’s uncle, and 
became the king’s favourite, obtaining the position of tutor to the king’s two 
sons, Jetthatissa and Mahāsena. The king was also known as Meghavannābhaya 
(v.98).</p>
