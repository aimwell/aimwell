  <h2>Cakkaratana</h2>

</ul>
<p>One of the seven treasures of a 
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a>. When a Cakkavatti is born into the world, the Cakkaratana 
appears before him from the Cakkadaha, travelling through the air (J.iv.232, but 
see Vepulla). </p>
<p>The Cakkaratana is the Cakkavatti’s 
chief symbol of office; on its appearance before him, he sprinkles it with water 
and asks it to travel to the various quarters of the world, winning them for 
him. This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti 
with his fourfold army. Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that 
quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to 
him. Having thus traversed the four quarters of the earth, it returns to the 
Cakkavatti’s capital, and remains fixed as an ornament on the open terrace in 
front of his inner apartments (D.ii.173f; M.iii.173ff).</p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.617ff; 
MA.ii.942ff) contain lengthy descriptions of the Cakkaratana: it is shaped like 
a wheel, its nave is of sapphire, the centre of which shines like the orb of the 
moon, and round it is a band of silver. It has one thousand spokes, each 
ornamented with various decorations; its tyre is of bright coral; within every 
tenth spoke is a coral staff, hollow inside, which produces the sounds of the 
fivefold musical instruments when blown upon by the wind. On the staff is a 
white parasol, on either side of which are festoons of flowers. When the wheel 
moves, it appears like three wheels moving one within the other.</p>
<p>When a Cakkavatti dies or leaves the 
world, the Cakkaratana disappears from the sight of men for seven days; it gives 
warning of a Cakkavatti’s impending death by slipping from its place some time 
before the event (D.iii.59f.; MA.ii.885). When his successor has lived 
righteously for seven days, it reappears (D.iii.64).</p>
<p>It is the most precious and the most 
honoured thing in the world. UdA.356.</p>
