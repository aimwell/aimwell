  <h2>Veroca</h2>

</ul>
<p>An Asura chieftain. All the hundred sons of Bali were 
named after him (D.ii.259). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.689) that Veroca was another name 
for Rāhu, and that he was the uncle of Bali’s sons. He is probably identical 
with Verocana, lord of the Asuras' who, according to the Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.i.225f), went with Sakka to visit the Buddha during his siesta. They waited 
upon the Buddha, leaning against a doorpost, and each uttered two stanzas on the 
necessity of striving until one’s aim is accomplished.</p>
