<p>A minister of Parakkamabāhu II. To him 
were entrusted, by the king, various acts of piety, such as building the road to 
the shrine at Sumanakūta. In making this road the minister constructed several 
bridges, and, at the top of the peak, he placed an image of the god Sumana. He 
also built a three-storeyed pāsāda at Hatthavanagalla-vihāra. The village of 
Mahālābugaccha was given to his family in perpetuity, and he was entrusted with 
the special care of the Tooth Relic. (For a detailed account of his doings, see 
Cv.lxxxvi.4ff). He was evidently a great patron of learning (P.L.C.214, 219).</p>
