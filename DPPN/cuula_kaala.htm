<p><b>1. Cūla-Kāla.</b>-The youngest of three 
brothers, named Kāla, house-holders of Setavyā. He accompanied Mahā-Kāla to 
Sāvatthi with a caravan, and when Mahā-Kāla entered the Order he joined him. 
Later, as they were returning to Setavyā, this time with the Buddha and the 
monks, he was sent on ahead to arrange seats in his former house, whither the 
Buddha and the monks had been invited. His two erstwhile wives mocked at him and 
persuaded him to return to the lay-life. DhA.i.55ff</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Cūla-Kāla.</b>-A previous birth of Aññā-Kondañña. 
He was a house-holder of Hamsavatī, in the time of Vipassī Buddha. One day going 
to the rice-field, he hulled a kernel of rice, ate it and found it unusually 
sweet. He thereupon obtained his share of the field from his brother Mahā-Kāla, 
and gave to the Buddha and the monks the first-fruits of a single crop, nine 
times, at nine different stages (DhA.i.82). He thus became the first to gain any 
attainment when Gotama Buddha preached his first sermon (DhA.i.8ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Cūla-Kāla.</b>-A lay disciple of the 
Buddha. He was once on his way back to Sāvatthi, having spent the night in 
listening to the Doctrine, when thieves, fleeing from their pursuers, threw 
their stolen goods in front of him and disappeared. When he was charged with 
theft, some women water-carriers, who had witnessed the incident on their way to 
the watering place, obtained his release. DhA.iii.157.</p>
