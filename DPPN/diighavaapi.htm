<p>A tank and a district in Ceylon. When 
the Buddha went to Ceylon he visited the village, and on the spot where he sat 
in meditation a cetiya was later erected (Mhv.i.78; Dpv.ii.60; Sp.i.89). It 
seems to have been the central post in the country lying between the Tamil 
kingdom and the province of Rohana. Thus we find Dutthagāmani’s brother, Tissa, 
occupying it by the order of his father. Later, on the death of his father, he 
retired to Dīghavāpi with his mother and the elephant Kandula (Mhv.xxiv.2, 14f, 
48). When he made peace with his brother, he was again sent there to look after 
the district.</p>
<p>After the conquest of the Tamils, Tissa 
was again in charge of Dīghavāpi, for we find him being sent for from there at 
the time of Dutthagāmani’s death (Mhv.xxxii.2). Tissa (afterwards called 
Saddhātissa) founded the Dīghavāpi-vihāra, in connection with which he built a 
cetiya, to which he made valuable offerings (Mhv.xxxiii.9, 14). We hear of 
Dīghavāpi in connection with the campaigns of Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxxiv.89; 98, 
110, 180; lxxv.1, 10). Many years later Rājasīha II. gave the district round 
Dīghavāpi to the settlers who came from Holland (Cv.xcvi.25, 28; for its 
identification see Cv.Trs.ii.30, n.1). The village of Mahāmuni, residence of 
Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in Dīghavāpi (DhA.iv.50). Dīghavāpi was 
nine leagues from Tissamahārāma (AA.i.386).</p>
