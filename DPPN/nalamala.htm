<p>An ocean passed by Suppāraka and his crew on their way 
from Bharukaccha. It looked like an expanse of reeds or a grove of bamboos.
</p>
<p>The scholiast explains that the sea was red like “scorpion 
reeds” or “crab weeds,” which are red in colour. </p>
<p>The sea contained coral (velu) in its bed, and some of 
this Suppāraka hauled into his ship. J.iv.140,141.</p>
