<p>He belonged to the family of a provincial ruler (mandalikarājā), 
but was unable to maintain his country’s independence, and lost his throne. 
While wandering about in misery, he saw and heard the Buddha, entered the Order, 
and won arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a householder, and gave 
the Buddha a panasa-fruit mixed with a curry of cocoa-nut. Thirteen kappas ago 
he was a king named Indasama (Thag.vs.102; ThagA.i.206). He is evidently 
identical with Khajjadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.182.</p>
