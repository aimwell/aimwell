  <h2>Pacalā Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Once, when the Buddha was at Sumsumāragiri, he saw with 
his divine eye that Moggallāna was at Kallavālamuttagāma, and that he was 
nodding (pacalāyamāno) very sleepily. He thereupon visited him and instructed 
him in the various ways of overcoming somnolence. Some other miscellaneous 
subjects are also dealt with in this sutta, such as the proper way of entering a 
house, the benefits of dwelling in solitude, the advantages of practising mettā.
