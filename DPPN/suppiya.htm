<p><b>1. Suppiya. </b>A Paribbājaka. He was the teacher of 
Brahmadatta. It was the discussion between these two, in the Ambalatthikā park, 
regarding the virtues of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Order, which led to the 
preaching of the Brahmajāla Sutta (D.i.1). Suppiya was a follower of Sañjaya 
Belatthiputta. DA.i.35.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Suppiya.</b> One of the chief lay supporters of 
Siddhattha Buddha. Bu.xvii.20.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Suppiya Thera.</b> He was born in Sāvatthi in a 
family of cemetery keepers. Converted by the preaching of his friend, the Thera 
Sopāka, he entered the Order and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin, named 
Varuna, who left his ten children and became an ascetic in the forest. There he 
met the Buddha and his monks and gave them fruit. He belonged to a khattiya 
family in the time of Kassapa Buddha, but through pride of birth and learning 
used to detract his colleagues hence his birth in a low caste in his last life.
