<p><b>Kaccāna Peyyāla.</b>-Mentioned in the Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.i.118) together with the Madhupindika Sutta and the Pārāyana Sutta as an 
exposition of Mahā Kaccāna, in consequence of which the Buddha declared the 
Elder to be chief among those who could explain in detail what had been stated 
briefly. The reference is probably to the Kaccāna Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Kaccāna Sutta.</b>-A discourse to the monks 
by Mahā Kaccāna on the six topics of recollection — the Buddha, Dhamma and 
Sangha, one’s own virtues, generosity and the devas (A.iii.314ff). It is quoted 
in the Visuddhi-magga (p.519), where it is stated that to speak of casual 
happenings as a mere arising is to contradict both the Padesa-vihāra Sutta and 
the Kaccāna Sutta. See also Kaccāna Peyyāla.</p>
