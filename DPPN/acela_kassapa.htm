<p><b>1. Acela-Kassapa.</b>-A naked ascetic. He 
visited the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at <a href="ujunnaa.htm" title="u/ujunnaa.htm">Ujuññā</a> in the Kanna-katthala deer-park and asked him if it 
were true that he disparaged all penance and reviled ascetics. Their 
conversation is recorded in the <a href="kassapasiihanaada_s.htm" title="ka/kassapasiihanaada_s.htm">Kassapa-Sīhanāda Sutta 
</a>(D.i.161ff). After the 
usual four months' probation, he joined the Order and in due course became an 
arahant (D.i.177; but according to DA.i.363 he was ordained forthwith).  </p>
<p>In the 
Majjhima Nikāya (M.iii.124ff.; also AA.i.171) we are told that he was an old 
friend of <a href="bakkula.htm" title="b/bakkula.htm">Bakkula Thera</a>, and that after a conversation with him obtained his 
ordination (under him).</p>
<p>See also Acela-Kassapa (3).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Acela-Kassapa.</b>-An old family friend 
of Cittagapahati. Having been for thirty years a paribbājaka, he admits to Citta 
that he had thereby obtained no particular excellence of knowledge. Citta tells 
him of his own attainments and Kassapa expresses a desire to enter the Order. He 
is duly ordained, and shortly afterwards becomes an arahant. S.iv.300ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Acela-Kassapa.</b>-The Kassapa mentioned 
in the Acela Sutta (S.ii.18f.; see also SA.ii.26f), probably to be identified 
with Acela-Kassapa (1), though the stories of their conversions are different.</p>
