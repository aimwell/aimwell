<title>Paribbājakā</title>

  <h2>Paribbājakā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the ascetics and recluses (not otherwise 
classified) of the Buddha’s time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their 
presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. 
Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after 
death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be 
won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of 
livelihood (See, e.g., M.ii.24). </p>
<p>All these four standards of conduct were bodily 
incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave 
to the <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ajīvakas</a> their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas 
claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and 
teaching (E.g., M.i.64f, 84f), but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings 
were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated (E.g.,Vin.i.39.) in connection 
with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under
<a href="sanjaya.htm" title="sa/sanjaya.htm">Sañjaya</a>. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness (amata) which, to them, 
probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s 
Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with 
causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states 
of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. (Chalmers: 
Further Dialogues i. Introd. xxi. For discussions on the views of the 
Paribbājakas as compared with those of the Buddha, see also A.iv.35ff., 378; 
i.215).</p>
<p>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as 
they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who 
spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the 
purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics 
and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in 
intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in 
the <a href="brahmajala_s.htm" title="b/brahmajala_s.htm">Brahmajāla Sutta</a>, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” 
and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention 
halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthi (D.i.178), and the 
<a href="kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm" title="ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm">Kūtāgārasālā</a> at Vesāli.
</p>
<p>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the 
groves near the settlements, as </p>
<ul>
  <li>at <a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a> on the bank of the 
  <a href="gaggaraa.htm" title="g/gaggaraa.htm">Gaggarā lake</a> (Ibid., 111),
  </li>
  <li>at the <a href="moranivapa.htm" title="me_mu/moranivapa.htm">Moranivāpa</a> in 
  <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> (A.v.326), and 
  </li>
  <li>on the banks of the <a href="sappini.htm" title="sa/sappini.htm">Sappinikā</a> (Ibid., i.185; ii.175).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each 
other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order 
to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The 
utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and 
discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride. Thus

</ul>
<p>The inhabitants of the towns and villager, near which the 
Paribbājakas stopped, visited them, both to show their respect and to benefit by 
their teachings. The names of a considerable number of Paribbājakas, besides 
those already mentioned, who were well known in the time of the Buddha, are 
given in the texts (e.g., <a href="annabhaara.htm" title="ay/annabhaara.htm">Annabhāra</a>, Varadhara, etc., A.ii.175), also 
<a href="samandaka.htm" title="sa/samandaka.htm">Sāmandaka</a> 
(S.iv.26) and the Paribbājikā <a href="sucimukhii.htm" title="s/sucimukhii.htm">Sucimukhī</a> (S.iii.238f). In most cases they are 
represented as having large followings, so that they were evidently regarded as 
distinguished teachers.</p>
