<p><b>1. Khujjasobhita Thera.</b>-An arahant. He 
was a brahmin of Pātaliputta. He entered the Order under Ānanda, after the 
Buddha’s death, and in due course won arahantship. At the First Council held in 
the Sattapanni Cave, he was sent to bring Ānanda to the Assembly. He travelled 
through the earth, gave the message to Ānanda, and returning through the air 
announced his arrival to the Sangha, through the medium-ship of a devatā who had 
been placed at the door of the cave to ward off Māra and his followers. Sobhita 
was called “Khujja” because he was slightly hunchbacked.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara he saw the 
Buddha passing with a large assembly of monks and praised him in ten stanzas 
(Thag.234-6; ThagA.i.350f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Sayampatibhāniya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.410f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Khujjasobhita Thera.</b>-One of the Pācīnaka (“Eastern”) monks who proclaimed the ten indulgences at Vesāli. He was 
one of their representatives on the Committee of the Sangha appointed to settle 
the dispute between the monks of Vesāli and the orthodox monks (Vin.ii.305; 
Dpv.iv.44; v.25, 80).  </p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa (iv.57; this passage is also 
found in the Samantapāsādikā i.34) this Khujjasobhita was a disciple of Ānanda 
and, therefore, to be identified with Khujjasobhita (1). The latter was, 
how-ever, an arahant, and therefore not likely to side with the Vesāli heretics. 
The identification is evidently incorrect also on other grounds, among them that 
of age.</p>
