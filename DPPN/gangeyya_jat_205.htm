  <h2>Gangeyya J훮taka (No.205)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Two fish, one from Gang훮, the other from 
Yamun훮, once met at the confluence of the rivers and disputed as to their 
relative beauty. They appealed to a tortoise who was there for a decision; he 
said they were both beautiful, but he himself was more beautiful than either.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to two 
monks who bragged of their good looks and quarrelled about them. They appealed 
to an older monk, who gave the same answer as the tortoise of the story. 
J.ii.151f.</p>
