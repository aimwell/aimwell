<p><b>1. Channa Sutta.</b>-Records the visit of 
Channa paribbājaka to Ānanda, at Sāvatthi. He asks Ānanda why the Buddha 
preaches the abandonment of rāga, dosa, moha; Ānanda explains and Channa goes 
away satisfied (A.i.215f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Channa Sutta.</b>-Channa Thera goes from 
cell to cell in the monastery at Isipatana, asking the Elders to teach him the 
Dhamma. Finding that their teachings do not help him in getting rid of craving, 
he visits Ānanda at the Ghositārāma. Ānanda praises Channa for his new-found 
humility, and repeats to him a sermon which he (Ānanda) had heard the Buddha 
preach to the monk Kacchānagotta, dealing with the paticcasamuppāda.</p>
<p>Channa expresses his delight with the 
exposition of Ānanda (S.iii.132ff). The Commentary (SA.ii.231f) says that this 
account refers to Channa, the companion of the Buddha. After the infliction on 
him of the Brahmadanda, he was greatly affected, and wandered from place to 
place. In the course of these wanderings he came to <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Channa Sutta.</b>-Records the incidents 
in connection with the suicide of Channa Thera (Channa 2). S.iv.55f; SA.iii.12; 
cf. M.iii.263ff. </p>
