<hr>
<p><b>Meghiya Thera.</b> He belonged to a Sākyan family of 
Kapilavatthu, and having joined the Order, was for some time the personal 
attendant of the Buddha. Once, when the Buddha was staying with him at Cālikā 
(this was in the thirteenth year after the Enlightenment, BuA.3), Meghiya went 
to Jantugāma for alms, and, on his return, was much attracted by a mango grove 
on the banks of the river Kimikālā. He asked the Buddha’s permission to dwell 
there in meditation. Twice the Buddha refused, but, on his third request, let 
him go. There, however, Meghiya was consumed by evil thoughts and returned to 
the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him on the five things which make the heart 
ripe for emancipation&nbsp;&nbsp; good friends, virtuous life, profitable talks, 
zealous exertion, insight&nbsp;&nbsp; and admonished him. Meghiya thereupon 
attained arahantship. A.iv.354ff.; Ud.iv.1; Thag.66; AA.ii.794; DhA.i.289 says, 
however, that at the end of the Buddha’s sermon Meghiya became a sotāpanna.</p>
<p>Ninety one kappas ago, on the death of Vipassī Buddha, 
there was a great earthquake. The people were very frightened, but Vessavana 
explained to them the reason for it and dispelled their fears. Meghiya was then 
a householder, and having thus heard of the Buddha’s qualities, was filled with 
joy. Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samita (UdA.217ff.; ThagA.i.149f). 
He is evidently to be identified with Buddhasaññaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.151f.</p>
