<p>A brahmin of Kosambī. Having heard the 
Buddha preach, he entered the Order. At that time the Kosambī monks had become 
contentious, but Gavaccha remained steadfast and attained to arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a labourer and, finding the monk Sujāta looking for pieces of stuff for a robe, 
gave him his garment.</p>
<p>As a result, he was king of the devas 
thirty-three times and king of men seven times (Thag.11; ThagA.i.55f). He is, 
perhaps, identical with Upaddhadussadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.435f; but the 
same verses are, in ThagA. (i.266) also attributed to Heraññakāni.</p>
