<p>A householder was lodging in a poor old 
woman’s house on the road from Benares to Uttarāpatha. During his stay there his 
thoroughbred mare foaled, and the foal was given to the woman at her request, in 
part payment of her charges. She brought up the foal as though he were her own 
child. Some time after, the Bodhisatta, who was then a householder, happened to 
pass the same way and discovered the thoroughbred’s presence by the behaviour of 
his own horses. The woman agreed to part with the foal to him for a large price 
on condition that he should be provided with all manner of luxuries. The 
Bodhisatta kept his word, and when the king came to inspect his horses, made the 
foal, who knew his own worth, exhibit his marvellous powers. The king installed 
him as his state horse, and thereafter the lordship of all India passed into the 
king’s hands.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Sāriputta. Once, when the Buddha was returning to Sāvatthi after a tour, the 
citizens decided to celebrate his arrival by each one taking on himself the task 
of feeding a certain number of monks in the Buddha’s retinue. A poor old woman 
wished to feed a monk, but all the monks were already allotted, only Sāriputta 
remaining. She invited him to her house, and he accepted her invitation. When it 
became known that Sāriputta was to feed with her, the king and all the rich 
citizens of Sāvatthi sent her food and garments and money to help in her 
entertainment of the Elder. As a result, through the kindness of Sāriputta, she 
became rich in a single day.</p>
<p>Sāriputta is identified with the 
thoroughbred of the Jātaka (J.ii.286ff).</p>
<p>This is evidently the same story as that 
which, in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.325), is called the 
Kundakasindhayapotaka Jātaka. But there the story is related, not in reference 
to Sāriputta, but to the Buddha himself, because he accepted a cake of 
rice-husks from the slave-woman <a href="punnaa.htm" title="pu/punnaa.htm">Punnā</a>. This is probably due to some 
confusion with two or more stories of similar import. See also
