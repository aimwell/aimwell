  <h2>Sañjīva Jātaka (No. 150)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was a famous teacher in Benares, and among 
his pupils was a young brahmin, Sañjīva, who was taught a spell for raising the 
dead, but not the counter spell. One day he went with his companions into the 
forest, and they came across a dead tiger. He uttered the charm and restored it 
to life. The tiger instantly killed him and fell down dead again.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Ajātasattu after his 
visit to the Buddha. The Buddha said that had it not been for his crime of 
patricide he would have become a sotāpanna, but because of his early association 
with Devadatta he had committed numerous bad deeds and shut himself out from 
that possibility.</p>
<p>Sañjīva is identified with Ajātasattu. J.i.508 11.</p>
