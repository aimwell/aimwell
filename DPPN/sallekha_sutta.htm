<p>The eighth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya. Mahā Cunda visits 
the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him how to get rid of the various false views 
current about self and the universe. The Buddha answers that it is by right 
comprehension of the fact that there is no “mine,” “I” or “self.” He then goes 
on to explain how false views can be expunged, how the will ma y be developed, 
and how emancipation can be found (M.i.40ff).</p>
<p>The Sallekha Sutta is given (DA.i.178; MA.i.275) as an 
example of a discourse where brahmacariya is defined as methunavirati. It is 
also sometimes (E.g., SA.ii.169) described as pālivasena gambhīro.</p>
