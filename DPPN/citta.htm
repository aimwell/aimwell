<p><b>1. Citta (called Cittagahapati).</b>-A 
householder of <a href="macchikaasanda.htm" title="ma/macchikaasanda.htm">Macchikāsanda</a>, where he was Treasurer. He was later declared by 
the Buddha to be pre-eminent among laymen who preached the Doctrine (A.i.26). On 
the day of his birth the whole city was covered knee-deep with flowers of 
various hues, hence his name.  </p>
<p>When Mahānāma visited Macchikāsanda, Citta, 
pleased with his demeanour, invited him to his park, the Ambātakārāma, and built 
for him a monastery there. And there the Elder preached to Citta the 
Salā-yatana-vibhatti and Citta became an Anāgāmī. Thereafter many monks visited 
the Ambātakārāma and accepted Citta’s hospitality. Among them was Isidatta 
(q.v.), a former acquaintance of Citta, but Isidatta left when he found that his 
identity had been discovered. Mahānāma and Mahaka did likewise, after having 
performed miracles at the request of Citta.  </p>
<p>The Citta Samyutta (S.iv.282ff) 
contains a record of conversations between Citta and members of the Order, among 
whom, besides those already mentioned, were Kāmabhū and Godatta. Citta is also 
said to have had discussions with Nigantha Nātaputta and Acela Kassapa and to 
have refuted their views.</p>
<p>A thera named Sudhamma was a permanent 
resident in the Ambātakārāma and was looked after by Citta. Once, when the two 
Chief Disciples and several other eminent Elders came to the Ambātakārāma, Citta 
invited first these and then Sudhamma; the latter, feeling slighted, blamed 
Citta beyond measure, but the Buddha, hearing of this, sent Sudhamma to ask for 
Citta’s pardon (Vin.ii.15ff; DhA.ii.74f; for details see Sudhamma).</p>
<p>Some time later, Citta visited the 
Buddha. He was accompanied by two thousand others and took with him five hundred 
cartloads of offerings to the Buddha and the Order. As he fell at the feet of 
the Buddha, flowers of five hues showered from the sky and the Buddha preached 
to him the Salāyatana-vibhatti. For a fortnight he continued distributing his 
gifts to the Order and the devas filled his carts with all kinds of valuables 
(AA.i.210).</p>
<p>When Citta lay ill just before his 
death, devas visited him and advised him to wish for kingship among them, but he 
refused to aspire to anything so impermanent, and instructed the devas and his 
kinsfolk gathered round him, telling them of the Buddha and his teachings 
(S.iv.302f). He is regarded as the ideal layman (E.g., at A.i.88; ii.164; 
iii.451).</p>
<p>He owned a tributary village called 
Migapattaka (SA.iii.93).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Citta 
conceived his desire to be placed first among laymen in the teaching of the 
Dhamma. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a huntsman. One day, seeing a monk 
in a glen, and being pleased thereat, he hurried home, prepared a meal and 
brought it to the monk, together with flowers he had gathered on the way. After 
the offering, he made a wish that he should never lack for tribute and that 
showers of flowers should fall on him. In the deva-world he surpassed all others 
in his great beauty (AA.i.209). In the Bhisa Jātaka (J.iii.314), he is 
identified with the slave.</p>
<p>Though Citta was not an arahant, he 
possessed the patisambhidā of a probationer (sekha). Vsm.442.</p>

<p><b>2. Citta.</b>-The Bodhisatta born as 
a Candāla. For details see the <a href="citta_sambhuuta_jat_498.htm" title="c/citta_sambhuuta_jat_498.htm">Citta-Sambhuta Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Citta, Cittaka.</b>-A deer, 
brother of Rohanta, the Bodhisatta. He is identified with Ānanda. For details 
see the <a href="rohantamiga_jat_501.htm" title="r/rohantamiga_jat_501.htm">Rohantamiga Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Citta called Hatthirohaputta (Hatthisāriputta)</b>.-A 
thera, son of an elephant trainer, who, having entered the Order, studied under 
the Buddha and gained special proficiency in distinguishing subtle differences 
in the meanings of words. Six times he left the Order and six times returned. 
His last quarrel was with <a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahā Kotthita</a>, who objected to his constant 
interruptions of the Elder’s discussions regarding the Abhidhamma. (This 
incident is recorded at A.iii.392ff).  </p>
<p>It is said (DA.ii.378f.; AA.ii.688) that 
in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Citta and a friend entered the Order. When the 
friend expressed a desire to return to household life, Citta encouraged him to 
do so, coveting his belongings. This was the reason for Citta’s inability to 
remain in the Order. He was a friend of Potthapāda, and when he had returned for 
the sixth time to a householder’s life, Potthapāda brought him to the Buddha. 
Citta listened to their conversation and asked questions regarding personality. 
At the end of the discourse (recounted in the Potthapāda Sutta) Citta once more 
joined the Order, never again to leave it, for he soon after became an arahant 
(D.i.199ff).</p>
<p>The <a href="kuddaala_jat_70.htm" title="ku/kuddaala_jat_70.htm">Kuddāla Jātaka</a> (J.i.311f) gives the 
circumstances in which he first joined the Order. He was a youth of good family 
at Sāvatthi. One day, while on his way home from ploughing, he received from the 
bowl of a certain Elder some rich and dainty food. In order to gain similar food 
for himself, he became a monk, but soon after, lust overcame him and he left the 
homeless life. Even after he became an arahant his colleagues are said to have 
taunted him, asking when he would be leaving them, and it was only when the 
Buddha told them that such a time would never be were they satisfied.</p>
<p>The same story, except for certain 
details, is also found in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.305ff), but there 
Citta is called Cittahattha, and a different explanation is given of his name: 
esa cittavasiko hutvā vicarati ti Cittahatthan ti nāmam karimsu. It is further 
stated that on the last occasion of his leaving home he saw his pregnant wife 
lying asleep and was so filled with, revolt that he returned to the Order. He 
started forth at once, a yellow robe tied round his waist, and as he walked to 
the vihāra, he became a sotāpanna. The monks were at first reluctant to 
re-ordain him, but his importunity was so great that they relented, and in a few 
days he became an arahant.</p>

<p><b>5. Citta.</b>-One of the chief lay 
supporters of <a href="sujaata.htm" title="s/sujaata.htm">Sujāta</a> Buddha. Bu.xiii.30.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Citta.</b>-A Thera of Ceylon. King 
Mahādāthika Mahā-nāga had a young and beautiful queen, named Damiladevī. One 
day, when she was worshipping at the Ambatthala at Cetiyagiri, Citta, who had 
joined the Order in his old age, fell in love with her and behaved as one mad, 
constantly repeating to himself “beautiful as Damiladevī.” Even when told of her 
death, which took place soon after, he refused to believe the news and continued 
as before; he became, therefore, known as Ummattaka Citta. AA.i.13.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Citta.</b>-A herdsman, servant of 
Dīghagāmani. He was put to death by the brothers of Ummāda-Cittā, because he 
refused to promise to kill Ummāda-Cittā’s child should it be a boy. He was 
reborn as a yakkha. See Cittarāja. Mhv.ix.22f.; MT.278.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Citta</b>.-A minister, spoken of 
as Cittamahāmatta. He was very generous and kept in his house a gong, by 
sounding which monks could obtain the requisites at any time. Each day he spent 
sixty kahāpanas for the supply of medicines alone. VibhA.341.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Citta</b>.-A city where <a href="mangala.htm" title="ma/mangala.htm">Mangala</a> 
Buddha performed his Twin Miracle. BuA.119.</p>
