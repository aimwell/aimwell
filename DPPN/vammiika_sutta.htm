<p>A deity appeared before <a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kumārakassapa</a> in 
<a href="andhavana.htm" title="ay/andhavana.htm">Andhavana</a> and 
propounded a riddle:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is an anthill burning day and night. The brahmin 
said: 'Take your tool, Sumedha (sage), and dig.' As the brahmin dug, he came 
across, successively, a bar, a frog, a forked passage, a strainer, a tortoise, a 
cleaver, a joint of meat&nbsp;-&nbsp; all of which he was told to cast out and 
dig on. He then came across a cobra, which he was asked not to harm, but to 
worship.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the suggestion of the deity, Kassapa related the story to the 
Buddha, who solved the riddle. The anthill is the body, the brahmin the arahant, 
the tool wisdom, digging perseverance, the bar ignorance, the forked passage 
doubting, the strainer the five nīvaranas, the tortoise the fivefold upādānakkhandhas, the cleaver the fivefold pleasures of sense, the joint of meat passion’s delights (nandīrāga), and the cobra (nāga) the arahant monk 
(M.i.142ff).</p>
<p>According to the Commentary (MA.i.340), Kumārakassapa was 
not an arahant at the time of the preaching of the sutta. The deity was a deity 
of the <a href="suddhaavaasaa.htm" title="s/suddhaavaasaa.htm">Suddhāvāsa</a> brahma world. He was one of five friends who, in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha, had entered the Order and who, in order to meditate 
uninterruptedly, had climbed a rock by means of a ladder which they had then 
removed, thus cutting off their return. The eldest became an arahant in three 
days, the second (anuthera) was this deity, who had become an anāgāmī. The third 
was Pukkusāti, the fourth Bāhiya Dārucīriya and the last Kumārakassapa. This 
deity was responsible for the arahantship both of Bāhiya and Kassapa, for 
Kassapa took the Vammīka Sutta as the subject of his meditations and thus 
developed insight.</p>
