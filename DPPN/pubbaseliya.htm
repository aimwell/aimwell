<p>One of the seventeen heterodox sects which arose in 
Jambudīpa in the second century after the Buddha’s death (Mhv.v.12; Dpv.v.55).
</p>
<p>According to the Kathāvatthu Commentary (see Points of 
Controversy xli.104, 108, 115) they belonged to the Andhaka school. Their views 
seem to have been similar to those of the Cetiyavādins (J.R.A.S. 1910, p. 413 
ff). </p>
<p>According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill: op. cit., 184) 
they were so called because they lived on the Pūrva Mountain.</p>
