<p>One of the chief ministers at Sāvatthi. 
He joined the Order of monks and his wife became a nun. They had their meals 
together and she waited on him, fetching him water and fanning him. He forbade 
her to wait on him as it was improper and, angered by his words, she poured the 
water over his head and struck him with the fan. For this she was rebuked by the 
Buddha. Vin.iv.263.</p>
