  <h2>Lakuntaka Bhaddiya Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was born in a wealthy family of Sāvatthi and was given 
the title of Lakuntaka (Dwarf) owing to his very small stature. He was, 
nevertheless, beautiful in body, says the ApA.; but see 
below. </p>
<p>Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and 
became learned and eloquent, teaching others in a sweet voice. Once, on a 
festival day, a woman of the town, driving with a brahmin in a chariot, saw the 
Elder and laughed, showing her teeth. The Elder, taking the teeth as his object, 
developed jhāna and became an anāgāmī. Later, after being admonished by 
Sāriputta, he developed mindfulness regarding the body and became an arahant. 
The Udāna (vii.1, 2) makes reference to the admonitions of Sāriputta and to the 
Buddha’s joy when these had the desired effect. The Commentary (UdA.360f.) gives 
details.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a very rich 
householder of Hamsavatī, and, having beard the Buddha describe one of his monks 
as the sweetest voiced among them all, he wished for a similar distinction for 
himself under a future Buddha. In the time of Phussa Buddha he was a 
cittapattakokila, named Nanda, (the Ap.loc.infra says he was the king’s general) 
who, seeing the Buddha in the royal park, placed in his bowl a ripe mango. In 
Kassapa Buddhas day he was the chief architect entrusted with the building of 
the thūpa over the Buddha’s relics, and, when a dispute arose as to how big the 
thūpa should be, he decided in favour of a small one; hence his small stature in 
his last life. ThagA.i.469ff.; Ap.ii.489f; the account in AA.i.110f. is slightly 
different; the Kelisīla Jātaka (q.v.) gives a different reason for his 
shortness.</p>
<p>In the assembly of monks the Buddha ranked him as foremost 
among sweet voiced monks (A.i.25) (mañjussarānam). Several stories connected 
with Bhaddiya are recorded in the books. Because of his shortness and his 
youthful appearance he was sometimes mistaken for a novice (DhA.iii.387). 
Elsewhere (S.ii.279; cp. Ud.vii.5) it is said that, because he was ugly and 
hunch backed, he was despised by his companions, and the Buddha had to proclaim 
to them his greatness and hold him up as an example of a man who, though small, 
was of great power. Another account relates how novices used to pull his hair 
and tweak his ears and nose saying, “Uncle, you tire not of religion? You take 
delight in it?” But he showed no resentment and took no offence. DhA.ii.148; the 
introduction to the Kelisīla Jātaka, (J.ii.142) speaks of thirty monks from the 
country who, seeing Bhaddiya at Jetavana, pulled him about until they were told 
by the Buddha who he was.</p>
<p>It was in reference to Bhaddiya that the Buddha preached 
two famous riddle stanzas in the Dhammapada (294, 295; for the explanation of 
the riddle see DhA.iii.454), where he describes the arahant as one who has 
killed father and mother and two kings and destroyed a kingdom, but who yet goes 
scathe less&nbsp;&nbsp; the words having a metaphorical meaning.</p>
<p>Several stanzas uttered by Bhaddiya in the Ambātakavana, 
as he sat there enjoying the bliss of arahantship, are included in the 
Theragāthā (Thag.vss.466 72). </p>
<p>In the Avadānasataka he is called Lakuñcika. See 
Avs.ii.152 60.</p>
