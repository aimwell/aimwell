<p>A monastery in Sāvatthi, near Jetavana, built by Pasenadi (J.ii.15). It was 
to the south east of the city, corresponding to Thūpārāma in Anurādhapura. 
(MA.ii.1021). It was there that the Nandakovāda Sutta was preached (M.iii.271). 
This was probably the monastery built for nuns by Pasenadi, at the Buddha’s 
suggestion, after the assault on Uppalavannā in Andhavana, referred to in the 
Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.52). </p>
<p>The Samyutta Commentary, however, gives a different account (SA.iii.218f.; 
the introductory story of the Bharu Jātaka; J.ii.170, gives the same account but 
omits the statement that the king built a vihāra). It states that the heretics, 
jealous of the Buddha and his popularity, desired to build a monastery for 
themselves in close proximity to Jetavana, and, in order that he might raise no 
objections, they presented Pasenadi with one hundred thousand. </p>
<p>When the Buddha discovered their intentions, owing to the great uproar they 
made while preparing the preliminaries of the building, he sent Ānanda to the 
king, asking to have it stopped. But Pasenadi refused to see him or Sāriputta or 
Moggallāna. (It was as a punishment for this discourtesy that he lost the throne 
before his death.) Thereupon the Buddha went himself. Pasenadi received him and 
entertained him to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached to him the 
Bharu Jātaka (q.v.) on the evils of bribery and of creating an opportunity for 
virtuous people to quarrel among themselves. Pasenadi was filled with remorse; 
he had the heretics expelled, and, realizing that he had never built a 
monastery, proceeded to construct the Rājakārama.</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.360ff ) contains several sermons preached by the 
Buddha at the Rājakārāma.</p>
