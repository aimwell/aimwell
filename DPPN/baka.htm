  <h2>Baka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>A Brahmā. When the Buddha was once staying at
  <a href="ukkatthaa.htm" title="u/ukkatthaa.htm">Ukkatthā</a> in the
  <a href="subhagavana.htm" title="s/subhagavana.htm">Subhagavana</a>, he read the thoughts of Baka, who had conceived the idea 
that this world was permanent and free from decay and death; and the Buddha 
visited him in order to point out his error. </p>
<p>Baka welcomed the Buddha but, owing to the influence of
<a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a>, refused to acknowledge his error, until the Buddha, by the exercise of 
his magical power, prevented Baka from disappearing from sight, while he himself 
dissolved into complete darkness. The Buddha then proceeded to tell him of four 
incidents connected with his previous birth as <a href="kesava.htm" title="ku/kesava.htm">Kesava</a> (M.i.326ff.; 
S.i.142ff). </p>
<p>Baka was once born in a noble family, but he renounced the 
world and became an ascetic named Kesava. One day, seeing a caravan in distress 
in the desert, by his supernatural power he turned a river into the desert, 
thereby rescuing the members of the caravan. On another occasion, while staying 
on the banks of the river <a href="enii.htm" title="e/enii.htm">Enī</a>, near a frontier village, he found the 
village being attacked by dacoits, whom he drove away by causing them to see a 
vision of the royal police approaching, with himself at their head. On another 
day he saw people floating down the river in boats, making merry, singing and 
drinking. The Nāga of the river, incensed at their behaviour, appeared before 
them, threatening destruction. Kesava, assuming the form of a Garuda, frightened 
the Nāga away. The fourth incident is related in the
<a href="kesava_jat_346.htm" title="ku/kesava_jat_346.htm">Kesava Jātaka</a>. The 
Bodhisatta, known as <a href="kappa.htm" title="ka/kappa.htm">Kappa</a>, was the pupil of Kesava. Kesava, practising 
meditation, developed the fourth jhāna and was born in the
<a href="vehapphala.htm" title="vy/vehapphala.htm">Vehapphala</a>
world. While there he developed the third jhāna and was born 
in the <a href="subhakinna.htm" title="s/subhakinna.htm">Subhakinha</a> world. Thence he descended to the
<a href="aabhassara.htm" title="aa/aabhassara.htm">Abhassara</a> 
world, and, later, by practising the first jhāna, he was reborn in the same 
world, but with a span of life of only a single kappa (J.iii.358 ff.; SA.i.164 
f.; MA.i.553 ff). </p>
