<p>A river near Kusinārā in which the 
Buddha bathed and from which he drank water before entering Kusinārā for his 
parinibbāna. On its bank was a mango-grove where the Buddha rested awhile on a 
robe spread for him by Cundaka; there he reassured Cunda, telling him that no 
blame attached to him for having provided the Buddha with the meal which was to 
be his last (D.ii.129,134f; Ud.viii.5; UdA.402f). </p>
<p>It is said (DA.ii.571) that when the 
Buddha bathed in the river, its banks and all the fishes it contained became 
golden.</p>
