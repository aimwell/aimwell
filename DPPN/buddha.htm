  <h2>1. Buddha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A generic name, an appellative — 
but not a proper name — given to one who has attained Enlightenment (na mātarā 
katam, na pitarā katam — vimokkhantikam etam buddhānam bhagavantānam bodhiyā 
mūle ... paññatti, MNid.458; Ps.i.174) a man superior to all other beings, human 
and divine, by his knowledge of the Truth (Dhamma).  </p>
<p>The texts mention two kinds 
of Buddha: viz.,  </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="pacceka_buddha.htm" title="pa/pacceka_buddha.htm">Pacceka Buddhas</a> — i.e., Buddhas who also attain to 
complete Enlightenment but do not preach the way of deliverance to the world; 
and </li>
  <li>Sammāsambuddhas, who are omniscient and are teachers of Nibbāna (Satthāro). 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentaries, however (e.g., SA.i.20; AA.i.65) make mention of four classes 
of Buddha: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sabaññu-Buddhā</li>
  <li>Pacceka Buddhā</li>
  <li>Catusacca Buddhā </li>
  <li>Suta Buddhā</li>
</ul>
<p>All 
arahants (khīnāsavā) are called Catusacca Buddhā and all learned men Bahussuta 
Buddhā. A Pacceka Buddha practises the ten perfections (pāramitā) for two 
asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, a Sabbañu Buddha practises it for 
one hundred thousand kappas and four or eight or sixteen asankheyyas, as the 
case may be (see below).</p>
<p>Seven Sabbaññu Buddhas are mentioned in the earlier books; 
these are  </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vīpassī</a></li>
  <li><a href="sikhii.htm" title="s/sikhii.htm">Sikhī</a></li>
  <li><a href="vessabhuu.htm" title="vy/vessabhuu.htm">Vessabhū</a></li>
  <li><a href="kakusandha.htm" title="ka/kakusandha.htm">Kakusandha</a></li>
  <li><a href="konaagamana.htm" title="ku/konaagamana.htm">Konāgamana</a></li>
  <li><a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a></li>
  <li><a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a></li>
</ul>
<p>E.g., D.ii.5f.; S.ii.5f.; cp. Thag.491; J.ii.147; they are also mentioned at 
Vin.ii.110, in an old formula against snake bites. Beal (Catena, p. 159) says 
these are given in the Chinese Pātimokkha. They are also found in the Sayambhū 
Purāna (Mitra, Skt. Buddhist Lit. of Nepal, p. 249).</p>
<p>This number is increased in the later books. The 
<a href="buddhavamsa.htm" title="b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> contains detailed particulars of twenty five Buddhas, including the 
last, Gotama, the first twenty four being those who prophesied Gotama’s 
appearance in the world. They are the predecessors of Vipassī, etc., and are the 
following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Dīpankara, Kondañña, Mangala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita, Anomadassī, 
Paduma, Nārada, Padumuttara, Sumedha, Sujāta, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī, 
Siddhattha, Tissa and Phussa. </li>
</ul>
<p>The same poem, in its twenty seventh chapter, 
mentions three other Buddhas&nbsp;-&nbsp; Tanhankara, Medhankara and Saranankara&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
who appeared in the world before Dīpankara. </p>
<p>The Lalitavistara has a list of 
fifty four Buddhas and the Mahāvastu of more than a hundred. The 
<a href="cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm" title="c/cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm">Cakkavatti 
Sīhanāda Sutta</a> (D.iii.75ff ) gives particulars of
<a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteyya Buddha</a> who will be 
born in the world during the present kappa. The
<a href="anaagatavamsa.htm" title="ay/anaagatavamsa.htm">Anāgatavamsa</a> gives a detailed 
account of him. Some MSS. of that poem (J.P.T.S. 1886, p. 37) mention the names 
of ten future Buddhas, all of whom met Gotama who prophesied about them. These 
are Metteyya, Uttama, Rāma, Pasenadi Kosala, Abhibhū, Dīghasonī, Sankacca, Subha, 
Todeyya, Nālāgiripalaleyya (sic). </p>
<p>The <a href="mahapadana_s.htm" title="maha/mahapadana_s.htm">Mahāpadāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.5f ) which mentions the seven 
Buddhas gives particulars of each under eleven heads (paricchedā)&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
the kappa in which he is born, his social rank (jāti), his family (gotta), 
length of life at that epoch (āyu), the tree under which he attains 
Enlightenment (bodhi), the names of his two chief disciples (sāvakayuga), the 
numbers present at the assemblies of arahants held by him (sāvakasannipāta), the 
name of his personal attendant (upatthākabhikkhu), the names of his father and 
mother and of his birthplace. The Commentary (DA.ii.422ff) adds to these other 
particulars&nbsp;-&nbsp; the names of his son and his wife before his 
Renunciation, the conveyance (yāna) in which he leaves the world, the monastery 
in which his Gandhakuti was placed, the amount of money paid for its purchase, 
the site of the monastery, and the name of his chief lay patron. In the case of 
Gotama, the further fact is stated that on the day of his birth there appeared 
also in the world Rāhulamātā, Ānanda, Kanthaka, Nidhikumbhi (Treasure Trove), 
the Mahābodhi and Kāludāyī. Gotama was conceived under the asterism (nakkhatta) 
of Uttarāsālha, under which asterism he also made his Renunciation (Da.ii425), 
preached his first sermon and performed the Twin Miracle. Under the asterism of 
<a href="visaakha.htm" title="vy/visaakha.htm">Visākha</a> he was born, attained Enlightenment and died; under that of 
<a href="maagha.htm" title="ma/maagha.htm">Māgha</a> he 
held his first assembly of arahants and decided to die; under Assayuja he 
descended from Tāvatimsa.</p>
<p>The Buddhavamsa Commentary says (BuA.2f) that in the 
Buddhavamsa particulars of each Buddha are given under twenty two heads, the 
additional heads being the details of the first sermon, the numbers of those 
attaining realization of truth (abhisamaya) at each assembly, the names of the 
two chief women disciples, the aura of the Buddha’s body (ramsi), the height of 
his body, the name of the Bodhisatta (who was to become Gotama Buddha), the 
prophecy concerning him, his exertions (padhāna) and the details of each 
Buddha’s death. The Commentary also says that mention must be made of the time 
each Buddha lived as a householder, the names of the palaces he occupied, the 
number of his dancing women, the names of his chief wife, and his son, his 
conveyance, his renunciation, his practice of austerities, his patrons and his 
monastery.</p>
<p>There are eight particulars in which the Buddhas differ 
from each other (atthavemattāni). These are length of life in the epoch in which 
each is born, the height of his body, his social rank (some are born as 
khattiyas, others as brahmins), the length of his austerities, the aura of his 
body (thus, in the case of Mangala, his aura spread throughout the ten thousand 
world systems, while that of Gotama extended only one fathom; — but when he 
wishes, a Buddha can spread his aura at will, BuA.106); the conveyance in which 
he makes his renunciation, the tree under which he attains Enlightenment, and 
the size of the seat (pallanka) under the Bodhi tree. </p>
<p>Only the first five are mentioned in DA.ii.424; also at 
BuA.105; all eight are given at BuA.246f., which also gives details under each 
of the eight heads, regarding all the twenty five Buddhas.</p>
<p>In the case of all Buddhas, there are four fixed spots (avijahitatthānāni). 
These are:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the site of the seat under the Bodhi tree (bodhipallanka), </li>
  <li>the Deer 
Park at <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a> where the first sermon is preached, </li>
  <li>the spot where the Buddha 
first steps on the ground at Sankassa on his descent from Tusita (Tāvatimsa?)</li>
  <li>the spots marked by the four posts of the bed in the Buddha’s 
  <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a> 
  in Jetavana. </li>
</ul>
<p>The monastery may vary in size; the site of the city in which it stands may 
also vary, but not the site of the bed. Sometimes it is to the east of the 
vihāra, sometimes to the north (DA.ii.424; BuA.247).</p>
<p>Thirty facts are mentioned as being true of all Buddhas (samatimsavidhā 
dhammatā). </p>
<ul>
  <li>In his last life every Bodhisatta is conscious at the moment of his 
conception; </li>
  <li>in his mother’s womb he remains cross legged with his face turned 
outwards; </li>
  <li>his mother gives birth to him in a standing posture; </li>
  <li>the birth takes 
place in a forest grove (araññe); </li>
  <li>immediately after birth he takes seven steps 
to the north and roars the “lion’s roar”; </li>
  <li>he makes his renunciation after seeing 
the four omens and after a son is born to him; </li>
  <li>he has to practise austerities 
for at least seven days after donning the yellow robe; </li>
  <li>he has a meal of milk 
rice on the day of his Enlightenment; </li>
  <li>he attains to omniscience seated on a 
carpet of grass; </li>
  <li>he practises concentration in breathing; </li>
  <li>he defeats Māra’s 
forces; </li>
  <li>he attains to supreme perfection in all knowledge and virtue at the foot 
of the Bodhi tree; </li>
  <li>Mahā Brahmā requests him to preach the Dhamma; </li>
  <li>he preaches 
his first sermon in the Deer Park at <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>; 
  </li>
  <li>he recites the <a href="patimokkha.htm" title="pa/patimokkha.htm">Pātimokkha</a> to the 
fourfold assembly on the full moon day of Māgha; </li>
  <li>he resides chiefly in <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, 
he performs the Twin Miracle in <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>; 
  </li>
  <li>he preaches the Abhidhamma in 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>; </li>
  <li>he descends from there at the gate of Sankassa; </li>
  <li>he constantly lives 
in the bliss of phalasamāpatti; </li>
  <li>he investigates the possibility of converting 
others during two jhānas; </li>
  <li>he lays down the precepts only when occasion arises 
for them; </li>
  <li>he relates Jātakas when suitable occasions occur; </li>
  <li>he recites the <a href="buddhavamsa.htm" title="b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> in the assembly of his kinsmen; 
  </li>
  <li>he always greets courteously monks 
who visit him; </li>
  <li>he never leaves the place where he has spent the rainy season 
without bidding farewell to his hosts; </li>
  <li>each day he has prescribed duties before 
and after his meal and during the three watches of the night; </li>
  <li>he eats a meal 
containing flesh (mamsarajabhojana) immediately before his death; </li>
  <li>and just 
before his death he enters into the twenty four crores and one hundred thousand 
samāpattī. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are also mentioned four dangers from which all Buddhas are 
immune: </p>
<ul>
  <li>no misfortune can befall the four requisites intended for a Buddha; </li>
  <li>no 
one can encompass his death; </li>
  <li>no injury can befall any of his thirty two
  <a href="mahapurisa.htm" title="maha/mahapurisa.htm">Mahāpurisalakkhanā</a> or eighty anubyañjanā; 
  </li>
  <li>nothing can obstruct his aura (BuA.248). </li>
</ul>
<p>A Buddha is born only in this Cakkavāla out of the ten 
thousand Cakkavālas which constitute the jātikkhetta (AA.i.251; DA.iii.897). 
There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; 
the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil. 236, and quoted in 
DA.iii.900f). No Buddha can arise until the sāsana of the previous Buddha has 
completely disappeared from the world. This happens only with the 
dhātuparinibbāna (see below). When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother’s 
womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the 
world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.</p>
<p>Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he 
attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to 
die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp. DA.iii.897).</p>
<p>The <a href="mahapadana_s.htm" title="maha/mahapadana_s.htm">Mahāpādāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.12-15) and the
<a href="acchariyabbhuta_s.htm" title="am/acchariyabbhuta_s.htm">Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta</a> (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, 
which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha. Later books (e.g., J.i.) have 
greatly enlarged these accounts. They describe how the Bodhisatta, having 
practised the thirty Pāramī, and made the five great gifts (pañcamahāpariccāgā), 
and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariyā — ñātattha-cariyā, 
lokattha-cariyā and buddhi-cariyā&nbsp;-&nbsp; gives the seven mahādānā, as in the 
case of <a href="vessantara.htm" title="vy/vessantara.htm">Vessantara</a>, making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after 
death in Tusita. The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipassī Buddha, remained in 
Tusita during the whole permissible period&nbsp;-&nbsp; fifty seven crores and 
sixty seven thousand years. But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing 
the full span of life there. Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his 
end is near (see Deva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, 
beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta 
thereupon makes the five investigations (pañcamahāvilokanāni).</p>
<p>Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a <a href="kappa2.htm">kappa</a>, such a kappa 
being called Sārakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Varakappa; 
sometimes four, Sāramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f). No Buddha 
is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred 
thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and 
death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching. When the life of man 
is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of kilesa. The 
suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred 
years and not more than ten thousand. The Bodhisatta must first consider the 
continent and the country of birth. Buddhas are born only in 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>, and 
there, too, only in the <a href="majjhimadesa.htm" title="ma/majjhimadesa.htm">Majjhimadesa</a>. He must then consider the family; 
Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more 
esteemed during that particular age. Then he must think of the mother: she must 
be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the 
Buddha’s birth.</p>
<p>Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes to 
<a href="nandanavana.htm" title="n/nandanavana.htm">Nandanavana</a> in Tusita, and while wandering about there “falls away” from Tusita 
and takes conception. He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or 
dying thought. The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is 
awareness of conception. When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no 
further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure. For seven days previously she 
observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth 
might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).</p>
<p>On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having 
bathed in scented water after the celebration of the Asālha festival, and having 
eaten choice food, takes upon herself the uposatha vows and retires to the 
adorned state bedchamber. As she sleeps, she dreams that the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Four Regent Gods</a> 
raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Himālaya, bathe her in Lake Anotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with 
heavenly flowers (according to the Nidānakathā, J.i.50, it is their queens who 
do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see 
Dial.ii.116n). Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion. 
There they lay her with her head to the east. The Bodhisatta, assuming the form 
of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times 
round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb. She 
awakes and tells her husband of her dream. Soothsayers are consulted, and they 
prophesy the birth of a <a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakka-vatti</a> or of a Buddha.</p>
<p>The two suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances 
obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother’s womb. It is said 
(DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of 
her middle age. This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and 
child. Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta. The Commentaries 
expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the suttas. 
Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having 
taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, 
looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion’s roar: “Aggo 'ham asmi 
lokassa, jettho 'ham asmi lokassa, settho 'ham asmi lokassa, ayam antimā jāti, 
natthi dāni punabbhavo” (D.ii.15). </p>
<p>To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the 
Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their 
symbolical meaning. See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the 
attaining of the four iddhi-pādas; 
facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are 
the seven bojjhangas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round 
means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the 
Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain 
in this life, etc.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the 
Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven 
strides northwards. Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did 
people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka 
Culābhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohapāsāda, settled the question 
by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers 
felt he was traveling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he 
was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his 
roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)</p>
<p>After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the 
soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone 
are open to him&nbsp;&nbsp; either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha. They also 
discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man (<a href="mahapurisa.htm" title="maha/mahapurisa.htm">Mahāpurisa</a>) 
(These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f). The Bodhisatta has also the 
eighty secondary signs (asīti anubyañjana) such as copper coloured nails glossy 
and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc. (The list is 
found in Lal. 121 [106]). The Brahmāyu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives 
other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all 
Buddhas. Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are 
neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on 
anything, he turns right round to do so (nāgavilokana). When entering a house he 
never bends his body (Cp. DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to 
wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he 
sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness. When preaching, he 
neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, 
enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139). His voice possesses eight 
qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and 
resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his 
voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f). A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) 
says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies&nbsp;-&nbsp; of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world, and of 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>, of Māras and of Brahmās. In these assemblies he becomes one of them 
and their language becomes his.</p>
<p>The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life 
of <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a>. He renounces the world only after the birth of a son. This, 
the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for 
other than a human being. He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old 
man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse. Some Buddhas see all four on the 
same day, others, like <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a>, at long intervals (DA.ii.457). On the night 
before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240). After 
the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mahā 
<a href="brahmaloka.htm" title="b/brahmaloka.htm">Brahmā</a>. 
This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his 
teaching (DA.ii.467). A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree to 
<a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a> for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because 
he wished to meet <a href="upaka.htm" title="u/upaka.htm">Upaka</a> on the way (DA.ii.471).</p>
<p>The Buddha’s day is divided into periods, each of which 
has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.). He rises early, and having 
attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the 
alms round. He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, 
sometimes with a large following of monks. When he wishes to go alone he keeps 
the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271). 
Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and 
then only khīnāsavā are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65). Sometimes he goes 
in the ordinary way (pakatiyā), sometimes accompanied by many miracles. After 
the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.</p>
<p>Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, 
talk to the monks and admonish them. To those who ask for subjects of 
meditation, he would give them according to their temperament. He would then 
retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while. After that, he looks 
around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then 
preach to those who come to him for instruction. In the evening he would bathe, 
and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice. The middle 
watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him. The last 
watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for 
exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to 
contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha’s 
teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision. 
Only beings that are veneyyā (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who 
possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha’s divine eye (DA.ii.470).  </p>
<p>The 
Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will. This is called Sabbaññupavārana, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to 
answer any question (SNA.i.229). Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his 
time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead 
the good life. This wandering is called cārikā and is of two kinds&nbsp;-&nbsp; turita and aturita. The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in 
a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person. Thus Gotama 
travelled three gāvutas to meet <a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>, thirty yojanas to see 
<a href="aalavaka.htm" title="aa/aalavaka.htm">Alavaka</a> and 
<a href="angulimaala.htm" title="ay/angulimaala.htm">Angulimāla</a>, forty five yojanas to see 
<a href="pukkusati.htm" title="pu/pukkusati.htm">Pukusāti</a>, etc. In the case of aturita 
cārikā progress is slow. The range of a Buddha’s cārikā varies from year to 
year. Sometimes he would tour the Mahāmandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes 
the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of 
six hundred yojanas. A tour of the Mahāmandala occupies nine months, that of the 
Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months. 
Details of the cārikā and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 
3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples 
(SNA.ii.474). The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two 
weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).</p>
<p>The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows 
everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see 
MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.). His ñāña is one of the four 
illimitables (neither can the Buddha’s body be measured for purposes of 
comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790). He converts people in one of three 
ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li>by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhipātihāriya), </li>
  <li>by reading their 
thoughts (ādesanāpātihāriya), </li>
  <li>or teaching them what is beneficial to them 
according to their character and temperament (anusāsanīpātihāriya). </li>
</ul>
<p>It is the 
last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha’s rivals say 
that he possesses the power of fascination (āvattanīmāyā); but this is untrue, as 
sometimes (e.g., in the case of the <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambi</a> monks) he cannot make even his own 
disciples obey him. Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha. 
They are called buddha veneyyā (SNA.i.331). Some are pleased by the Buddha’s 
looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the 
wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is 
goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.). </p>
<p>Though the Buddha’s teaching is never really lost on the 
listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit 
(see, e.g., <a href="udumbarika_s.htm" title="u/udumbarika_s.htm">Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta</a>, D.iii.57). It is said that wherever a monk 
dwells during the Buddha’s time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always 
have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha 
would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48). Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of 
light from his <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a> to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, 
appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him. Stanzas so preached 
are called obhāsagāthā (SNA.i.16, 265).</p>
<p>Every Buddha founds an Order; the first 
pātimokkhuddesagāthā of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479). The attainment of 
arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha’s instruction (DA.iii.732). Beings 
can obtain the four abhiññā only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204). A 
Buddha has ten powers (balāni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten 
fields of knowledge, </p>
<p>A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc. At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers 
are given as consisting of his knowledge of the Paticasamuppāda. The powers of a 
disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, 
e.g., D.iii.283) and 
physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants 
(BuA.37). He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the 
ojā put into it by the devas. No one else can eat with impunity the food which 
has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154). Besides these excellences, a 
Buddha possesses the four assurances (vesārajjāni, given at M.i.71f)), the 
eighteen āvenikadhammā*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*Described at Lal. 183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at 
  DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhammā, but they are all concerned with 
  the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.</p>
  <p>**Given by Sāriputta in the <a href="sampasadaniya_s.htm" title="sa/sampasadaniya_s.htm">Sampasādāniya Sutta</a> 
  (D.iii.102ff.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six 
classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree. This faculty is possessed 
in ascending scale by titthiyā, pakatisāvakā, mahāsāvakā, aggasāvakā, pacceka 
buddhā and buddhā (E.g.,Vsm.411).</p>
<p>Every Buddha holds a <a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya</a>, and only a Buddha 
is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of 
the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).</p>
<p>A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g., 
<a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a>). Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa,” but no 
Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the 
food he takes (DA.ii.413). </p>
<p>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here 
means āyukappa, the full span of a man’s life during that particular age. Some, 
like Mahāsīva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, 
overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of 
this Bhaddakappa. But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before 
his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.</p>
<p>No Buddha, however, dies till the sāsana is firmly 
established (D.iii.122).&nbsp; There are three parinibbānā in the case of a 
Buddha: kilesa parinibbāna, khandha parinibbāna and dhātu parinibbāna. The first 
takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha’s 
death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama’s relics 
see <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a>). Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are dighāyuka have 
only sammukhasāvakā (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), 
and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single thūpa being 
erected over them (SNA. 194, 195). Short lived Buddhas hold the uposatha once a 
fortnight; others (e.g. <a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet 
others (e.g. <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a>) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).  </p>
<p>After the Buddha’s 
death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten. The first Pitaka to be lost is the 
Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patthāna and ending with the Dhammasangani. Then, 
the Anguttara Nikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nipāta; 
next the Samyutta Nikāya from the Cakkapeyyāla to the Oghatarana; then the 
Majjhima, from the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and then the 
Dīgha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmajāla. Scattered gāthā like the 
Sabhiyapucchā, and the Ālavakapucchā, last much longer, but they cannot maintain 
the sāsana. The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being 
the mātikā of the Ubhatovibhanga (VibhA.432).</p>
<p>When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a 
monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f). It is said that on the night on which 
a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the 
colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134). Here we have the 
beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual 
“transfiguration” of the Buddha.</p>
<p>At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light 
can shine (SNA.ii.525).</p>
<p>No Buddha is born during the samvattamānakappa, but only 
during the vivattamānakappa (SNA.i.51). A Bodhisatta who excels in paññā can 
attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddhā, in eight, and 
one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f). When once a being 
has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune 
(SNA.i.50). The Buddha is referred to under various epithets. The Anguttara 
Nikāya gives one such list. There he is called Samana, Brāhmana, Vedagū, Bhisaka, 
Nimmala, Vimala, Ñānī and Vimutta (C.iv. 340). Buddhaghosa gives seven others: 
Cakkkumā, Sabbabhūtanukampī, Vihātaka, Mārasenappamaddī, Vusitavā, Vimutto and 
Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).</p>
<p>The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tathāgata. This 
term is explained at great length in the Commentaries&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., 
DA.i.59f. His followers usually address him as Bhagavā, while others call him by 
his name (Gotama). In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as 
Sakka (SN. vs. 345; perhaps the equivalent of Sākya), Brahma (SN. p.91; 
SNA.ii.418), Mahāmuni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262). Countless 
other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones. One very famous 
formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula 
being: Bhagavā araham sammāsambuddho, vijjācaranasampanno, sugato, lokavidū, 
anuttaro, purisadammasārathi, satthā devamanussānam, Buddho Bhagavā (these words 
are analysed and discussed in Vsm. 198 ff). It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) 
that the Buddha’s praises are limitless (aparimāna). One of his most striking 
characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet. 
</p>
<p>E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissallāna), 
(D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.). When he is in retirement it is usually 
akāla for visiting him (D.ii.270). There are also certain accusations, which are 
brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude. “It is 
said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion. By intercourse with 
whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an 
assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of 
things. He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle” (D.iii.38).</p>
<p>In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37). The 
dwelling place of a Buddha is called <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a>. His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it. When once he wishes 
it to be visible, no one can erase it. He can also so will that only one 
particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194). It is also said that his power of 
love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence 
(SNA.ii.475). A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in 
his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42). When the Buddha is seated in 
some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222). He 
prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).</p>
