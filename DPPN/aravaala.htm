<p>A Nāga king, who lived in the 
Aravāladaha in Kasmīra-Gandhāra. He had been in the habit of destroying the 
crops of the people by causing hail-storms. When Majjhantika Thera was sent by 
Moggaliputtatissa’s Council to convert Kasmīra-Gandhāra, the thera went to 
Aravāladaha and standing in the air above it showed himself to the Nāgas. 
Hearing of this the nāga king came out and tried to frighten the Elder with 
various terrors. When all his attempts had failed he acknowledged defeat and the 
thera preached to him. He and his 84,000 followers were established in the 
Refuge and the Five Precepts (v.l. Āravāla). Sp.i.65; Mhv.xii.9-20.</p>
