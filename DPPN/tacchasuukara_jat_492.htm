<p>Once a carpenter in a village near 
Benares picked up a young boar from a pit and took him home and reared him, 
calling him Tacchasūkara (Carpenter’s Boar). The boar helped him in his work, 
fetching his tools and so on. When he grew up to be a big, burly beast, the 
carpenter let him go free in the forest. There he joined a herd of wild boars 
which was being harassed by a fierce tiger. Tacchasūkara made all the 
preparations for a counter-attack, digging pits and training all the members of 
the herd in their various duties, and their several positions at the time of 
attack. Under his guidance they succeeded in killing the tiger and greedily 
devouring the corpse. Tacchasūkara was told that there was a sham ascetic who 
had helped the tiger to eat the boars. The herd attacked the ascetic, who 
climbed up a fig-tree, but they uprooted the tree and devoured him. They 
consecrated Tacchasūkara as their king, making him sit on a fig-tree, and 
sprinkling water on him from a conch-shell, with its spirals turned right-wise, 
which the ascetic had used for drinking. </p>
<p>Hence arose the custom of seating the 
king on a chair of figwood and sprinkling him with water from a conch-shell at 
his coronation. The story was related in connection with the Thera 
Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.). Spies of Pasenadi had heard him discuss with the Thera 
Datta the plan of campaign which should be adopted if Pasenadi wished to defeat 
Ajātasattu. This was repeated to Pasenadi, who followed the suggestion and 
captured Ajātasattu. </p>
<p>Dhanuggahatissa is identified with 
Tacchasūkara. J.iv.342ff.</p>
