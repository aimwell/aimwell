<p>The Bodhisatta was once an elephant in the Himālaya, head 
of a herd of eighty thousand. His name was Sīlava. One day he saw a forester of 
Benares who had lost his way, and, feeling compassion for him, took him to his 
own dwelling, fed him with all kinds of fruit, and then, taking him to the edge 
of the forest, set him on his way to Benares. The wretched man noted all the 
landmarks, and, on reaching the city, entered into an agreement with ivory 
workers to supply them with Sīlava’s tusks. He then returned to the forest and 
begged Sīlava for a part of his tusks, pleading poverty and lack of livelihood. 
Sīlava allowed the ends of his tusks to be sawn off. The man returned again and 
again, until, at last, Sīlava allowed him to dig out the stumps as well. As the 
man was on his way back to Benares, the earth opened and swallowed him up into 
the fires of hell. A tree sprite, who had witnessed all this, spoke a stanza 
illustrating the evils of ingratitude.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s 
wickedness; he is identified with the forester and Sāriputta with the tree 
sprite (J.i.319-22; the story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha, p.202).</p>
<p>The birth as Sīlava is mentioned among those in which the 
Bodhisatta practised sīla pāramitā to perfection. E.g., MA.ii.617.</p>
