  <h2>Suhanu Jātaka (No. 158)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was minister to the king of Benares. The 
king had a wild horse called Mahāsona. The king was miserly, and one day, when 
some horse dealers brought horses for sale, he gave orders, unknown to his 
minister, that Mahāsona should be let loose among these horses, and that when he 
had bitten and weakened them, they should be bought at reduced price. The 
dealers complained to the minister. After inquiring into the matter, he advised 
them to bring Suhanu, a very strong horse they had, the next time they visited 
Benares. This they did, and when Mahāsona and Suhanu were confronted with each 
other they showed great affection, and started licking each other. The king saw 
this, and was told by his minister that the horses recognized each other’s 
virtues. He then warned the king against excessive covetousness.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to two hot headed monks, 
both passionate and cruel. One lived in Jetavana and the other in the country. 
One day the country monk came to Jetavana, and the monks eagerly awaited their 
quarrel. But when the two monks met they showed great affection. The Buddha 
explained that this was because of their like nature. J.ii.30-32.</p>
