<p>A cat once stood on the refuse heap of a house drain, and 
when the mouse who lived there came out, pounced on her and ate her. But the 
mouse gnawed the guts of the cat so that she died. Such will be the fate of 
monks who go among the dwellings of householders with unrestrained senses.
</p>
<p>The sutta was preached to a recalcitrant monk. S.ii.270.</p>
