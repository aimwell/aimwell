<p>Once a mother and her son <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
a monk and a nun — spent the rainy season at Sāvatthi. They saw much of each 
other and, in course of time, became guilty of incest. </p>
<p>When this was reported to the Buddha, he declared that 
nothing ensnares the heart of a man as does a woman; she is indeed a noose of 
Māra. A.iii.67f.</p>
