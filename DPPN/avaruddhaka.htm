<p>A yakkha. Having served Vessavana for 
twelve years, he received, as his reward, permission to take the boy, who later 
became known as Ayuvaddhana. On the day destined for the boyâ€™s death, 
Avaruddhaka, coming to claim his possession, found the Buddha and his disciples 
there, reciting texts and taking other measures to avert his death. Avaruddhaka 
had to step back twelve leagues to make room for his superiors and had 
eventually to go away without getting the boy. DhA.ii.237-8.</p>
