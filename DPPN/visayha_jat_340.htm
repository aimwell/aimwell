<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Visayha, setthi of 
Benares, and gave alms daily to six hundred thousand persons in six different 
parts of the city. Sakka’s throne was heated by his great generosity, and, 
feeling nervous for his safety, Sakka contrived that all Visayha’s possessions 
should disappear. Quite undaunted, Visayha became a grass cutter, and for six 
days gave alms from the money so earned, he and his wife fasting. On the seventh 
day, while cutting grass, he fainted, and Sakka, appearing before him, suggested 
that he, should be moderate in his generosity. Visayha rejected the suggestion 
as unworthy and declared that his aim was Buddhahood. Thereupon Sakka praised 
him and made him prosperous.</p>
<p>The story was related to Anāthapindika, as mentioned in 
the Khadirangāra Jātaka. Visayha’s wife is identified with Rāhulamātā. J.iii.128 
32; see also J.i.45.</p>
<p>The story is given in the Jātakamālā (No. 5), where the 
setthi is called Avisayha.</p>
