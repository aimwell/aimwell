<p> <b>1. Maniakkhi, Maniakkhika</b>. A Nāga king of Kalyāni, maternal uncle of Mahodara. 
</p>
<p>He came to take part in the battle between Mahodara and 
Cūlodara, and having heard the Buddha preach on that occasion, begged him to 
visit his kingdom. The Buddha agreed, and, three years later went to Kalyāni in 
the eighth year after the Enlightenment on the full moon day of Vesākha. The 
Nāga entertained him and his five hundred monks on the spot where, later, the 
Kalyāni cetiya was built. Mhv.i.63ff.; xv.162; Dpv.ii.42, 52; it is said that 
Manikkhika went to Jambudīpa to bring the Buddha to Ceylon (MT.111). 

According to the Extended Mahāvamsa (i.700) he was the uncle (mātula) of 
Mahodara.</p>
