<p>One of the divisions of the 
Mahāsanghikas (Dpv.v.40; Mhv.v.4). They were so called because they held that 
“all the doctrines are understood by a unique and immediate wisdom, for all the 
doctrines of the Buddha are comprehended by the intellect.” (Mhv.187f). They 
held, among other things, that the Tathāgathas were not subject to worldly laws, 
that the Dhammacakkas of all Tathāgathas did not agree; the Bodhisatta did not 
pass through the successive stages of embryonic development; that he is born at 
will among inferior beings for the salvation of mankind; with our wisdom the 
four truths are perfectly understood; he who has perfectly acquired right 
restraint has cast off all yoga (attachment). Rockhill, op. cit., 183.</p>
