<p>A district in Northern India, the modern 
Kashmir. In the Pali texts it is always mentioned with Gandhāra and probably 
once formed part of that kingdom. (See also PHAI., p.93. The Jātakas mention the 
countries separately as comprising two kingdoms ruled by a single king, e.g., 
J.iii.364, 378). At the end of the Third Council, Moggaliputta sent the thera 
Majjhantika to propagate the religion in Kasmīra-Gandhāra. Majjhantika quelled 
the power of the Nāga-king Aravāla (q.v.), who was a menace to the inhabitants, 
and converted him to the faith, while the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, 
with their five hundred sons, became sotāpannas. The thera preached the 
Āsīvisūpama Sutta to the assembled multitude and won eighty thousand converts, 
while one hundred thousand persons entered the Order. We are told that from that 
time onwards the yellow robe was held in great esteem in Kasmīra. (Mhv.xii.3,

<st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="9 ff">9 ff</st1:frenchfranctoeuro>; 
Dpv.viii.4; Sp.i.64ff; see also Beal, op. cit., i.134, n.39). There was 
evidently a large community of monks at Kasmīra, till long after the coming of 
Majjhantika, for we are told that two hundred and eighty thousand monks, led by 
Uttinna, came from Kasmīra to Anurādhapura on the occasion of the foundation 
ceremony of the Mahā Thupa (Mhv.xxix.37).</p>
<p>In Hiouien Thsang’s time Kasmīra seems 
to have been an independent kingdom whose king was given to serpent-worship 
while his queen was a follower of the Buddha. Near the capital was a stūpa which 
enshrined a tooth of the Buddha. This tooth was soon after taken away by 
Harsavardhana of Kanoj. (CAGI.104ff; Beal, i.116f, etc.)</p>
<p>Sāgala is mentioned as being twelve 
leagues from Kasmīra (Mil.82).</p>
