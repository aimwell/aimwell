</ul>
<p>A city, the capital of <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>. There seem to have been two distinct towns; 
the older one, a hill fortress, more properly called Giribbaja, was very ancient 
and is said (VvA. p.82; but cp. D.ii.235, where seven cities are attributed to 
his foundation) to have been laid out by Mahāgovinda, a skilled architect. The 
later town, at the foot of the hills, was evidently built by 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>. </p>
<p><a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a> says (Beal, ii.145) that the old capital occupied by 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> was called Kusāgra. It was afflicted by frequent fires, and Bimbisāra, on the 
advice of his ministers, abandoned it and built the new city on the site of the 
old cemetery. The building of this city was hastened on by a threatened invasion 
by the king of <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. The city was called 
Rājagaha because Bimbisāra was the 
first person to occupy it. Both Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hsien (Giles: 49) record 
another tradition which ascribed the foundation of the new city to 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>.</p>
<p>Pargiter (Ancient Ind. Historical Tradition, p.149) suggests that the old 
city was called Kusāgrapura, after Kusāgra, an early king of Magadha. In the 
Rāmāyana (i. 7, 32) the city is called Vasumatī. The Mahābhārata gives other 
names — Bārhadrathapura (ii.24, 44), Varāha, Vrsabha, Rsigiri, Caityaka 
(see PHAI.,p.70).  </p>
<p>It was also called Bimbisārapurī and Magadhapura (SNA.ii.584).</p>
<p>But both names were used indiscriminately (E.g., S.N. vs. 405), though 
Giribbaja seems, as a name, to have been restricted to verse passages. The place 
was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five 
hills — Pandava, Gijjhakūta, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla* — and Rājagaha, 
because it was the seat of many kings, such as Mandhātā and Mahāgovinda 
(SNA.ii.413). It would appear, from the names given of the kings, that the city 
was a very ancient royal capital. In the 
<a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm" title="vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm">Vidhurapandita Jātaka</a> (J.vi.271), 
Rājagaha is called the capital of <a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Anga</a>. This evidently refers to a time when 
Anga had subjugated Magadha. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* SNA.ii.382; it is said (M.iii.68) that these hills, with the exception of 
  Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vankaka for Vepulla (S.ii.191). 
  The Samyutta (i.206) mentions another peak near Rājagaha — Indakūta. See 
  also <a href="kaalasilaa.htm" title="ka/kaalasilaa.htm">Kālasilā</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., SNA. loc. cit) explain that the city was inhabited 
only in the time of <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddhas</a> and
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a> kings; at other times it was the 
abode of <a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkhas</a> who used it as a pleasure resort in spring. The country to the 
north of the hills was known as Dakkhināgiri (SA.i.188).</p>
<p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon 
after the Renunciation, journeying there on foot from the River Anomā, a 
distance of thirty leagues (J.i.66). Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, 
and, having discovered his identity and the purpose of his quest, obtained from 
him a promise of a visit to Rājagaha as soon as his aim should be achieved (See 
the <a href="pabbajja_sutta.htm" title="pa/pabbajja_sutta.htm">Pabbajjā Sutta</a> and its Commentary). During the first year after the 
Enlightenment therefore, the Buddha went to Rājagaha from
<a href="gayaa.htm" title="g/gayaa.htm">Gayā</a>, after the 
conversion of the <a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Tebhātika Jatilas</a>. 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> and his subjects gave the Buddha 
a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in 
the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal 
quarters, <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs 
of praise of the Buddha. It was during this visit that Bimbisāra gifted 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a> 
to the Order and that the Buddha received <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> as his 
disciples. (Details of this visit are given in Vin.i.35ff ). Large numbers of 
householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up 
their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those 
ordained were the <a href="s5_say.htm#Sattarasavaggiya" title="s/s5_say.htm#Sattarasavaggiya">Sattarasavaggiyā</a> with 
<a href="upaali.htm" title="u/upaali.htm">Upāli</a> at their head. </p>
<p>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the 
winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks 
everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first 
to <a href="dakkhinaagiri.htm" title="d/dakkhinaagiri.htm">Dakkhināgiri</a> and then to 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> (Vin.i.77ff). </p>
<p>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.13), the Buddha spent also in 
Rājagaha the third, fourth, seventeenth and twentieth vassa. After the twentieth 
year of his teaching, he made <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> his headquarters, though he seems 
frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of 
several important suttas — e.g., the <a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Atānātiya</a>, 
<a href="udumbarika_s.htm" title="u/udumbarika_s.htm">Udumbarika</a> and 
<a href="kassapasiihanaada_s.htm" title="ka/kassapasiihanaada_s.htm">Kassapasīhanāda</a>, 
<a href="jiivaka_s.htm" title="j/jiivaka_s.htm">Jīvaka</a>, <a href="mahasakuludayi_s.htm" title="maha/mahasakuludayi_s.htm">Mahāsakuladāyī</a>, and 
<a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha</a>. </p>
<p>For other 
incidents in the Buddha’s life connected with Rājagaha, see 
<a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a>. The most 
notable of these was the taming of <a href="naalaagiri.htm" title="n/naalaagiri.htm">Nālāgiri</a>. </p>
<p>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the 
Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an 
attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, <a href="vassakaara.htm" title="va/vassakaara.htm">Vassakāra</a>, to the Buddha at 
Gijjhakūta, to find out what his chances of success were (D.ii.72).</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with 
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a> 
at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at 
the <a href="sattapanniguha.htm" title="sa/sattapanniguha.htm">Sattapanniguhā</a>, and 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> extended to the undertaking his whole 
hearted patronage (Vin.ii.285; Sp.i.7f.; DA.i.8f., etc.). The king also erected 
at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his 
share (D.ii.166). According to the Mahā Vamsa, (Mhv.xxxi.21; MT. 564) some time 
later, acting on the suggestion of Mahā Kassapa, the king gathered at Rājagaha 
seven donas of the Buddha’s relics which had been deposited in various places — 
excepting those deposited at Rāmagāma — and built over them a large thūpa. 
It was from there that Asoka obtained relics for his vihāras.</p>
<p>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, 
various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were 
<a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, <a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>, 
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a> and <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> (D.ii.147).</p>
<p>The road from <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> to Rājagaha was one hundred and ninety two leagues 
long and passed through Sāvatthi, which was forty five leagues from Rājagaha. 
This road passed by the gates of <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> (MA.ii.987; SA.i.243). The Parāyana 
Vagga (SN. vss.1011-3) mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by 
<a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī’s</a> 
disciples in going from <a href="patitthaana.htm" title="pa/patitthaana.htm">Patitthāna</a> to Rājagaha, passing through 
<a href="maahissati.htm" title="ma/maahissati.htm">Māhissati</a>, 
<a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>, <a href="gonaddha.htm" title="g/gonaddha.htm">Gonaddha</a>, Vedisā. 
<a href="vanasa.htm" title="va/vanasa.htm">Vanasavhaya</a>, <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>,
<a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>, <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>,
<a href="setavya.htm" title="s/setavya.htm">Setavyā</a>, 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>,
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusinārā</a>, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places (see below).
</p>
<p>From <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> to Rājagaha was sixty leagues (AA.i.115; MA.i.360). From 
Rājagaha to Kusinārā was a distance of twenty five leagues (DA.ii.609), and the 
<a href="mahaparinibbana_s.htm" title="maha/mahaparinibbana_s.htm">Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.72ff ) gives a list of the places at which the 
Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road&nbsp; -
<a href="ambalatthikaa.htm" title="am/ambalatthikaa.htm">Ambalatthikā</a>, 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>, <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaligāma</a> (where he crossed the Ganges), 
<a href="kotigaama.htm" title="ku/kotigaama.htm">Kotigāma</a>, Nādikā (??), 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, Bhandagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha 
River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas. </p>
<p>From Rājagaha to the Ganges was a distance of five leagues, and when the 
Buddha visited Vesāli at the invitation of the Licchavis, the kings on either 
side of the river vied with each other to show him honour. DhA.iii.439f.; also 
Mtu.i.253ff.; according to Dvy. (p.55) the Ganges had to be crossed between 
Rājagaha and Sāvatthi, as well, by boat, some of the boats belonging to the king 
of Magadha and others to the Licchavis of Vesāli.</p>
<p>The distance between Rājagaha and Nālandā is given as one league, and the 
Buddha often walked between the two (DA.i.35).</p>
<p>The books mention various places besides Veluvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa 
vihāra in and around Rājagaha — e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, 
Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, 
Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapanniguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, 
Supatitthacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasondikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.</p>
<p>At the time of the Buddha’s death, there were eighteen large monasteries in 
Rājagaha (Sp.i.9). Close to the city flowed the rivers Tapodā and Sappinī. In 
the city was a Potter’s Hall where travelers from far distances spent the night. 
E.g., Pukkusāti (MA.ii.987); it had also a Town Hall (J.iv.72). The city gates 
were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. 
Vin.iv.116f.; the city had thirty-two main gates and sixty four smaller 
entrances (DA.i.150; MA.ii.795). One of the gates of Rājagaha was called 
Tandulapāla (M.ii.185). Round Rājagaha was a great peta world (MA.ii.960; 
SA.i.31).</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time there was constant fear of invasion by the Licchavis, 
and Vassakāra (q.v.) is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To 
the north east of the city were the brahmin villages of Ambasandā (D.ii.263) and 
Sālindiyā (J.iii.293); other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as 
Kītāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu 
(q.v.). In the Buddha’s time, Rājagaha had a population of eighteen crores, nine 
in the city and nine outside, and the sanitary conditions were not of the best. 
SA.i.241; DhA.ii.43; it was because of the city’s prosperity that the 
Mettiya-Bhummajakas made it their headquarters (Sp.iii.614). The city was not 
free from plague (DhA.i.232). </p>
<p>The Treasurer of Rājagaha and Anāthapindika had married each other’s sisters, 
and it was while Anāthapindika (q.v.) was on a visit to Rājagaha that he first 
met the Buddha.</p>
<p>The people of Rājagaha, like those of most ancient cities, held regular 
festivals; one of the best known of these was the Giraggasamajjā (q.v.). Mention 
is also made of troupes of players visiting the city and giving their 
entertainments for a week on end. (See, e.g., the story of Uggasena).</p>
<p>Soon after the death of the Buddha, Rājagaha declined both in importance and 
prosperity. Sisunāga transferred the capital to Vesāli, and Kālāsoka removed it 
again to Pātaliputta, which, even in the Buddha’s time, was regarded as a place 
of strategically importance. When Hiouen Thsang visited Rājagaha, he found it 
occupied by brahmins and in a very dilapidated condition (Beal, op. cit., 
ii.167). For a long time, however, it seems to have continued as a center of 
Buddhist activity, and among those mentioned as having been present at the 
foundation of the Mahā Thūpa were eighty thousand monks led by Indagutta.
