<p><b>1. Suppiyā.</b> The name of the inhabitants of Rājagaha 
in the time of Kassapa Buddha. At that time Vepulla was called Supassa (Suphassa). 
S.ii.192.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Suppiyā.</b> An upāsaka of Benares. Her husband was 
Suppiya, and they were both greatly devoted to the Order. One day, while on a 
visit to the monastery, Suppiyā saw a sick monk who needed a meat broth. On her 
return home, she sent an attendant to fetch meat; but there was none to be had 
in the whole of Benares. She therefore, with a knife, cut a piece of flesh from 
her thigh and gave it to her servant to make into soup for the monk. She then 
went to her room and lay on her bed. When Suppiya returned and discovered what 
had happened he was overjoyed, and, going to the monastery, invited the Buddha 
to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and when, on the 
next day, he arrived with his monks, he asked for Suppiyā. On hearing that she 
was ill, he desired that she be brought to see him. At the moment when the 
Buddha saw her wound was healed, covered with good skin, on which grew fine 
hairs as on the rest of her body.</p>
<p>It was as a result of this incident that the Buddha lay 
down a rule forbidding monks to eat human flesh, even when willingly given 
(Vin.i.216f).</p>
<p>Suppiyā is given as an example of one whose good deeds 
bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115; cf.291). She was declared by the Buddha 
foremost among women who waited on the sick (A.i.26), an eminence she had 
resolved to win in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. AA.i.244f.; she is mentioned 
in a list of eminent women lay disciples (A.iv.348).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Suppiyā.</b> One of the five daughters of the third 
Okkāka and Bhattā (Hatthā). DA.i.258; MT.131; SNA.ii.352.</p>
