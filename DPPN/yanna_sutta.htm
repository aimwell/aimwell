<p>Preached in reference to an animal sacrifice which 
Pasenadi proposed to hold on the advice of the brahmins in order to avert the 
effects of his evil dreams. </p>
<p>The Buddha, hearing of it, declares that such sacrifices 
never produce good results. There are other “sacrifices” which harm no one and 
by which the celebrants are blessed and the gods pleased. S.i.75.</p>
