<p>The Bodhisatta was, once a lion and had a cub by a she 
jackal. The cub was like his sire in appearance, but like his clam invoice. One 
day, after rain, when the lions were gambolling and roaring together, the cub 
thought to roar too, and yelped like a jackal. Thereupon all the lions at once 
fell silent. When the Bodhisatta was told of this by another cub he advised the 
jackal cub to keep quiet.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Kokālika’s attempt 
to preach, Kokālika is identified with the jackal voiced cub and Rāhula with his 
brother. J.ii.108f.</p>
