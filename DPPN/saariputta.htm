<p><b>1. Sāriputta Thera. </b>The chief disciple (aggasāvaka) 
of <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a> — <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. He is also called Upatissa, which was evidently his personal 
name (M.i.150). The commentators say that Upatissa was the name of his village 
and that he was the eldest son of the chief family in the village, but other 
accounts give his village as Nālaka. His father was the brahmin, 
<a href="vanganta.htm" title="va/vanganta.htm">Vanganta</a> 
(DhA.ii.84), and his mother, <a href="rupasari.htm" title="r/rupasari.htm">Rūpasāri</a>. It was 
because of his mother’s name that he came to be called Sāriputta. In Sanskrit 
texts his name occurs as Sāriputra, Sāliputra, Sārisuta, Sāradvatīputra. In the 
<a href="apadaana.htm" title="ay/apadaana.htm">Apadāna</a> (ii.480) he is also called Sārisambhava.</p>
<p>The name Upatissa is hardly ever mentioned in the books. 
He had three younger brothers — 
<a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Cunda</a>, <a href="upasena.htm" title="u/upasena.htm">Upasena</a>, 
and <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Revata</a> (afterwards called Khadiravaniya) — 
and three sisters — <a href="caalaa.htm" title="c/caalaa.htm">Cālā</a>, 
<a href="upacaalaa.htm" title="u/upacaalaa.htm">Upacālā</a> and <a href="sisupacala_theri.htm" title="s/sisupacala_theri.htm">Sisūpacālā</a>; 
all of whom joined the Order. DhA.ii.188; cf. Mtu.iii.50; for details of them 
see s.v.; mention is also made of an uncle of Sāriputta and of a nephew, both of 
whom he took to the Buddha, thereby rescuing them from false views (DhA.ii.230 
2); <a href="uparevata.htm" title="u/uparevata.htm">Uparevata</a> was his nephew (SA.iii.175).</p>
<p>The story of Sāriputta’s conversion and the account of his 
past lives, which prepared him for his eminent position as the Buddha’s Chief 
Disciple, have been given under <a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Mahā 
Moggallāna</a>. Sāriputta had a very quick intuition, and he became a sotāpanna</a> immediately after hearing the first two lines of the stanza spoken by 
Assaji. After his attainment of sotāpatti, Kolita (Moggallāna) wished to go with 
him to Veluvana to see the Buddha, but Sāriputta, always grateful to his 
teachers, suggested that they should first seek their teacher, Sañjaya, to give 
him the good news and go with him to the Buddha. But Sañjaya refused to fall in 
with this plan. Moggallāna attained arahantship on the seventh day after his 
ordination, but it was not till a fortnight later that Sāriputta became an 
arahant. He was staying, at the time, with the Buddha, in the Sūkarakhatalena in 
Rājagaha, and he reached his goal as a result of hearing the Buddha preach the 
Vedānapariggaha Sutta to Dīghanakha. This account is summarized from DhA.i.73 
ff.; AA.i.88 ff.; ThagA.ii.93 ff. Ap.i.15ff.; the story of their conversion is 
given at Vin.i.38ff.</p>
<p>In the assembly of monks and nuns, Sāriputta was declared 
by the Buddha foremost among those who possessed wisdom (etadaggam mahāpaññānam, 
A.i.23). He was considered by the Buddha as inferior only to himself in wisdom. 
SA.ii.45; his greatest exhibition of wisdom followed the Buddha’s descent from 
Tāvatimsa to the gates of Sankassa, when the Buddha asked questions of the 
assembled multitude, which none but Sāriputta could answer. But some questions 
were outside the range of any but a Buddha (DhA.iii.228 f.; cf. SNA.ii.570f.). 
Similarly knowledge of the thoughts and inclinations of people were beyond 
Sāriputta; only a Buddha possesses such knowledge (DhA.iii.426; J.i.182). 
Further, only a Buddha could find suitable subjects for meditation for everybody 
without error (SNA.i.18), and read their past births without limitation (SNA, 
ii.571).</p>
<p>The Buddha would frequently merely suggest a topic, and 
Sāriputta would preach a sermon on it in detail, and thereby win the Buddha’s 
approval. (See, e.g., M.i.13; iii.46, 55, 249). The Buddha is recorded as 
speaking high praise of him: “Wise art thou, Sāriputta, comprehensive and 
manifold thy wisdom, joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious. Even as the eldest 
son of a Cakkavatti king turns the Wheel as his father hath turned it, so dost 
thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Dhamma, even as I have turned it.” 
(S.i.191; cf. SN.vs.556 f., where the Buddha is asked by Sela, who is his 
general, and the Buddha replies that it is Sāriputta who turns the Wheel of the 
Law; also M.iii.29). He thus came to be called Dhammasenāpati, just as Ānanda 
was called Dhammabhandāgārika. The Anupada Sutta is one long eulogy of Sāriputta 
by the Buddha. He is there held up as the supreme example of the perfect 
disciple, risen to mastery and perfection in noble virtue, noble concentration, 
noble perception, noble deliverance. M.iii.25ff. In the Mahāgosinga Sutta 
Sāriputta expresses his view that that monk is beat who is master of his heart 
and is not mastered by it. The Buddha explains that Sāriputta was stating his 
own nature (M.i.215 f.). The Buddha did not, however, hesitate to blame 
Sāriputta when necessary&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., the occasion when some novices, 
becoming noisy, were sent away by the Buddha, whose motive Sāriputta 
misunderstood (M.i.459). And again, when Sāriputta did not look after Rāhula 
properly, making it necessary for Rāhula to spend the whole night in the 
Buddha’s jakes (J.i.161f.).</p>
<p>In the Saccavibhanga Sutta (M.iii.248) he is compared to a 
mother teacher, while Moggallāna is like a child’s wet nurse; Sāriputta trains 
in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good. In the 
Pindapāta pārisuddhi Sutta (M.iii.294f) the Buddha commends Sāriputta for the 
aloofness of his life and instructs him in the value of reflection. Other 
instances are given of the Buddha instructing and examining him on various 
topics&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., on bhūtam (“what has come to be”) (S.ii.47f), on the 
five indriyas, (S.v.220f., 225f., 233f ) and on sotāpatti. S.v.347; we find the 
Buddha also instructing him on the cultivation of tranquillity (A.i.65); on the 
destruction of “I” and “mine” (A.i.133); the reasons for failure and success in 
enterprises (A.ii.81f.); the four ways of acquiring personality (attabhāva) 
(A.ii.159); the methods of exhortation (A.iii.198); the acquisition of joy that 
comes through seclusion (A.iii.207); the noble training for the layman (211f.); 
six things that bring spiritual progress to a monk (424f.); seven similar things 
(A.iv.30); the seven grounds for praising a monk (35); the things and persons a 
monk should revere (120f.); the eight attributes of a monk free from the cankers 
(223 f.); the nine persons who, although they die with an attached remainder for 
rebirth, are yet free from birth in hell among animals and among petas (379 f.); 
and the ten powers of a monk who has destroyed the cankers (A.v.174 f.).</p>
<p>We also find instances of Sāriputta questioning his 
colleagues, or being questioned by them, on various topics. Thus he is 
questioned by Mahā Kotthita on kamma (S.ii.112 f.); and on yoniso manasikāra 
(progressive discipline, S.iii.176 f.); on avijjā and vijjā (ibid., 172 f.); on 
the fetters of sense perception (S.iv.162 f.); on certain questions pronounced 
by the Buddha as indeterminate (ibid., 384 f.); on whether anything is left 
remaining after the passionless ending of the six spheres of contact (A.ii.161); 
and on the purpose for which monks lead the brahmacariya under the Buddha 
(A.iv.382). The Mahāvedalla Sutta (M.i.292 ff.) records a long discourse 
preached by Sāriputta to Mahā Kotthita. He is mentioned as questioning Mahā 
Kassapa on the terms ātāpī and ottāpī (S.ii.195f.), and Anuruddha on sekha 
(S.v.174 f., 298f.). On another occasion, Anuruddha tells Sāriputta of his power 
of seeing the thousand fold world system, his unshaken energy, and his 
untroubled mindfulness. Sāriputta tells him that his deva sight is mere conceit, 
his claims to energy conceit, and his mindfulness just worrying, and exhorts him 
to abandon thoughts of them all. Anuruddha follows his advice and becomes an 
arahant. A.i.281f.</p>
<p>Moggallāna asks Sāriputta regarding the “undefiled” (their 
conversation forms the Anangana Sutta, M.i.25 ff.), and, at the conclusion of 
the Gulissāni Sutta, inquires whether the states of consciousness mentioned in 
that sutta were incumbent only on monks from the wilds or also on those from the 
villages (M.i.472f.). Sāriputta questions Upavāna regarding the bojjhangā 
(S.v.76), and is questioned by Ānanda regarding sotāpatti (S.v.346, 362) as 
regards the reason why some beings are set free in this very life while others 
are not (A.ii.167), and on the winning of perfect concentration (A.v.8, 320). 
Ānanda also questions Sāriputta (A.iii.201f.) on the speedy knowledge of aptness 
in things (kusaladhammesu khippanisanti), and, again, on how a monk may learn 
new doctrines and retain old ones without confusion (A.iii.361). In both these 
cases Sāriputta asks Ānanda to answer the questions himself, and, at the end of 
his discourse, praises him. The Rathavinīta Sutta (M.i.145 ff.) records a 
conversation between Sāriputta and Punna Mantānīputta, for whom he had the 
greatest respect, after hearing the Buddha’s eulogy of him. Sāriputta had given 
instructions that he should be told as soon as Punna came to Sāvatthi and took 
the first opportunity of seeing him. Among others who held discussions with 
Sāriputta are mentioned Samiddhi (A.iv.385), Yamaka (S.iii.109f.), Candikāputta 
(A.iv.403), and Laludāyi (A.iv.414).</p>
<p>Among laymen who had discussions with Sāriputta are Atula 
(DhA.iii.327), Nakulapitā (S.iii.2f.) and Dhānañjāni (M.ii.186); Sīvalī 
(immediately after his birth; J.i.408), also the Paribbājakas, Jambukhādaka 
(S.iv.251f.), Sāmandaka (S.iv.261 f.; A.v.120), and Pasūra (SNA.ii.538), and the 
female Paribbājakas Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and Patācārā (J.iii.1), and 
Kundalakesī (DhA.ii.223f.). He is also said to have visited the Paribbājakas in 
order to hold discussion with them (A.iv.378); see also S.iii.238f., where a 
Paribbājaka consults him on modes of eating.</p>
<p>The care of the Sangha and the protection of its members' 
integrity was Sāriputta’s especial concern by virtue of his position as the 
Buddha’s Chief Disciple. Thus we find him being sent with Moggallāna to bring 
back the monks who had seceded with Devadatta. His admonitions to the monks 
sometimes made him unpopular&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., in the case of the Assaji 
Punaabbasukā, the Chabbaggiyā (who singled him out for special venom) and 
Kokālika (See Channa, who reviled both Sāriputta and Moggallāna, DhA.ii.110 f.). 
When Channa declared his intention of committing suicide, Sāriputta attempted to 
dissuade him, but without success (S.iv.55ff.; see also the Channovāda Sutta). 
Monks sought his advice in their difficulties. (See, e.g., S.iv.103, where a 
monk reports to him that a colleague has returned to the household life, and 
asks what he is to do about it). He was greatly perturbed by the dissensions of 
the monks of Kosambī, and consulted the Buddha, at length, as to what he could 
do about it (Vin.i.354).&nbsp; He was meticulous about rules laid down by the 
Buddha. Thus a rule had been laid down that one monk could ordain only one 
samanera, and when a boy was sent to him for ordination from a family which had 
been of great service to him, Sāriputta refused the request of the parents till 
the Buddha had rescinded the rule (Vin.i.83). Another rule forbade monks to eat 
garlic (lasuna), and when Sāriputta lay ill and knew he could be cured by 
garlic, even then he refused to eat them till permission was given by the Buddha 
for him to do so (Vin.ii.140). The Dhammapada Commentary (Vin.ii.140f) describes 
how, at the monastery in which Sāriputta lived, when the other monks had gone 
for alms, he made the round of the entire building, sweeping the un-swept 
places, filling empty vessels with water, arranging furniture, etc., lest 
heretics, coming to the monastery, should say: “Behold the residences of 
Gotama’s pupils.” But even then he did not escape censure from his critics. A 
story is told (DhA.iv.184f) of how he was once charged with greed, and the 
Buddha himself had to explain to the monks that Sāriputta was blameless. While 
Sāriputta was severe in the case of those who failed to follow the Buddha’s 
discipline, he did not hesitate to rejoice with his fellow monks in their 
successes. Thus we find him congratulating Moggallāna on the joy he obtained 
from his iddhi powers, and praising his great attainments (praise which evoked 
equally generous counter praise), (S.ii.275 f ) and eulogising Anuruddha on his 
perfected discipline won through the practice of the four satipatthānas 
(S.v.301f). It was the great encouragement given by Sāriputta to Samitigutta 
(q.v.), when the latter lay ill with leprosy in the infirmary, which helped him 
to become an arahant. It was evidently the custom of Sāriputta to visit sick 
monks, as did the Buddha himself (ThagA.i.176). So great was Sāriputta’s desire 
to encourage and recognize merit in his colleagues that he once went about 
praising Devadatta’s iddhi powers, which made it difficult for him when later he 
had to proclaim, at the bidding of the Sangha, Devadatta’s evil nature 
(Vin.ii.189).</p>
<p>Several instances are given (E.g., S.ii.274; v.70; A.i.63; 
ii.160; iii.186, 190, 196, 200, 292, 340; iv.325, 328, 365; v.94, 102, 123, 315, 
356f) of Sāriputta instructing the monks and preaching to them of his own accord 
on various topics&nbsp;-&nbsp; apart from the preaching of the well known suttas 
assigned to him. Sometimes these suttas were supplementary to the Buddha’s own 
discourses (E.g., M.i.13, 24, 184, 469). Among the most famous of Sāriputta’s 
discourses are the Dasuttara and the Sangīti Suttas (q.v.). Though Sāriputta was 
friendly with all the eminent monks surrounding the Buddha, there was very 
special affection between him and Ānanda and also Moggallāna. We are told that 
this was because Ānanda  was the Buddha’s special attendant, a duty which 
Sāriputta would have been glad to undertake For details of this see Mahā 
Moggallāna, Ānanda. Ānanda himself had the highest regard and affection for 
Sāriputta. It is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.63) that once, when the 
Buddha asked Ānanda, “Do you also, Ānanda, approve of our Sāriputta?” Ānanda  
replied, “Who, Sir, that is not childish or corrupt or stupid or of perverted 
mind, will not approve of him? Wise is he, his wisdom comprehensive and joyous 
and swift, sharp and fastidious. Small is he in his desires and contented; 
loving seclusion and detachment, of rampant energy. A preacher is he, accepting 
advice, a critic, a scourge of evil.”</p>
<p>Sāriputta was specially attached, also, to Rāhula, the 
Buddha’s son, who was entrusted to Sāriputta for ordination. Mention is made of 
a special sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya, (the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta; M.i.421f ) 
in which he urges Rāhula to practise the study of breathing. The special regard 
which Sāriputta had for the Buddha and Rāhula extended also to Rāhulamātā, for 
we find that when she was suffering from flatulence. Rāhula consulted Sāriputta, 
who obtained for her some mango juice, a known remedy for the disease. 
(J.ii.392f) On another occasion (J.ii.433) he obtained from Pasenadi rice mixed 
with ghee and with red fish for flavouring when Rāhulamātā suffered from some 
stomach trouble. Among laymen Sāriputta had special regard for Anāthapindika; 
when the latter lay ill he sent for Sāriputta, who visited him with Ānanda and 
preached to him the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta. At the end of the discourse 
Anāthapindika said he had never before heard such a homily. Sāriputta said they 
were reserved for monks only, but Anāthapindika asked that they could be given 
to the laity and to young men of undimmed vision. Anāthapindika died soon after 
and was reborn in Tusita. M.iii.258 ff.; cf. S.v.380, which probably refers to 
an earlier illness of Anāthapindika. He recovered immediately after the 
preaching of Sāriputta’s sermon, and served Sāriputta with rice from his own 
cooking pot.</p>
<p>Sāriputta also, evidently, had great esteem for the 
householder Citta, for we are told (DhA.ii.74) that he once paid a special visit 
to Macchikāsanda to see him.</p>
<p>Several incidents are related in the books showing the 
exemplary qualities possessed by Sāriputta&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., the stories of 
Tambadāthika, Punna and his wife, the poor woman in the Kundakakucchisindhava 
Jātaka and Losaka Tissa (q.v.). These show his great compassion for the poor and 
his eagerness to help them. Reference has already been made to his first 
teacher, Sañjaya, whom he tried, but failed, to convert to the Buddha’s faith. 
His second teacher was Assaji. It is said that every night on going to bed he 
would do obeisance to the quarter in which he knew Assaji to be and would sleep 
with his head in that direction. DhA.iv.150 f.; cf. SNA.i.328. If Assaji were in 
the same vihāra, Sāriputta would visit him immediately after visiting the 
Buddha. It was in connection with this that the Dhamma Sutta (q.v.) was 
preached.</p>
<p>The stories of the Sāmaneras Sukha and Pandita, and of the 
monk Rādhā, also show his gratitude towards any who had shown him favour (See 
also Vin.i.55 f). His extreme affection for and gratitude to the Buddha are 
shown in the Sampasādanīya Sutta (q.v.). That Sāriputta possessed great patience 
is shown by the story (DhA.iv.146f) of the brahmin who, to test his patience, 
struck him as he entered the city for alms. But when he was wrongly accused and 
found it necessary to vindicate his good name, he did not hesitate to proclaim 
his innocence at great length and to declare his pre eminence in virtue. (See, 
e.g., his “lion’s roar” at A.iv.373ff). Another characteristic of Sāriputta was 
his readiness to take instruction from others, however modest. Thus one story 
relates how, in absent mindedness, he let the fold of his robe hang down. A 
novice said, “Sir, the robe should be draped around you,” and Sāriputta agreed, 
saying, “Good, you have done well to point it out to me,” and going a little 
way, he draped the robe round him (ThagA.ii.116). A quaint story is told 
(Ud.iv.4) of a Yakkha who, going through the air at night, saw Sāriputta wrapt 
in meditation, his head newly shaved. The sight of the shining head was a great 
temptation to the Yakkha, and, in spite of his companion’s warning, he dealt a 
blow on the Thera’s head. The blow was said to have been hard enough to shatter 
a mountain, but Sāriputta suffered only a slight headache afterwards.</p>
<p>Mention is made of two occasions on which Sāriputta fell 
ill. Once he had fever and was cured by lotus stalks which Moggallāna obtained 
for him from the Mandākinī Lake (Vin.i.214). On the other occasion he had 
stomach trouble, which was again cured by Moggallāna giving him garlic (lasuna), 
to eat which the rule regarding the use of garlic had to be rescinded by the 
Buddha (Vin.ii.140).</p>
<p>Sāriputta was fond of meal cakes (pitthakhajjaka), but 
finding that they tended to make him greedy he made a vow never to eat them 
(J.i.310).</p>
<p>Sāriputta died some months before the Buddha. It is true 
that the account of the Buddha’s death in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta ignores all 
reference to Sāriputta, though it does introduce him (D.ii.81 ff ) shortly 
before as uttering his “lion’s roar” (sīhanāda), his great confession of faith 
in the Buddha, which, in the commentarial account, he made when he took leave of 
the Buddha to die. The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.161) records that he died at 
Nālagāmaka (the place of his birth), and gives an eulogy of him pronounced by 
the Buddha after his death (S.v.163f). </p>
<p>There is no need to doubt the authenticity of this 
account. It merely states that when Sāriputta was at Nālagāmaka he was afflicted 
with a sore disease. His brother, Cunda Samanuddesa, was attending on him when 
he died. His body was cremated, and Cunda took the relics to Sāvatthi with 
Sāriputta’s begging bowl and outer robe. The relics were wrapped in his 
water-strainer. Cunda first broke the news to Ānanda, who confessed that when he 
heard it his mind was confused and his body felt as though drugged. Cf. 
Thag.vs.1034; see also the eulogy of Sāriputta by Vangīsa during his lifetime 
(Thag.1231 3). Hiouen Thsang saw the stūpa erected over the relics of Sāriputta 
in the town of Kālapināka (Beal, op. cit., ii.177). </p>
<p>Together they sought the Buddha and told him of the event, 
and the Buddha pointed out to them the impermanence of all things.</p>
<p>The Commentaries give more details. The Buddha returned to 
Sāvatthi after his last vassa in Beluvagāma. Sāriputta sought him there, and, 
realizing that his death would come in seven days, he decided to visit his 
mother, for she, though the mother of seven arahants, had no faith in the 
Sangha. [This was because all her children joined the Order and left her 
desolate in spite of the forty crores of wealth which lay in the house. It is 
said (DhA.iv.164f.) that when Sāriputta had gone home on a previous occasion, 
she abused both him and his companions roundly. Rāhula was also in the company.] 
He therefore asked his brother, Cunda, to prepare for the journey to Nālagāmaka 
with five hundred others, and then took leave of the Buddha after performing 
various miracles and declaring his faith in the Buddha and uttering his “lion’s 
roar.” A large concourse followed him to the gates of Sāvatthi, and there he 
addressed them and bade them stay behind. In seven days he reached Nālaka, where 
he wais met by his nephew, Uparevata, outside the gates. Him he sent on to warn 
his mother of his arrival with a large number of people. She, thinking that he 
had once more returned to the lay life, made all preparations to welcome him and 
his companions. Sāriputta took up his abode in the room in which he was born (jātovaraka). 
There he was afflicted with dysentery. His mother, unaware of this and sulking 
because she found he was still a monk, remained in her room. The Four Regent 
Gods and Sakka and Mahā Brahmā waited upon him. She saw them, and having found 
out who they were, went to her son’s room. There she asked him if he were really 
greater than all these deities, and, when he replied that it was so, she 
reflected on the greatness of her son and her whole body was suffused with joy. 
Sāriputta then preached to her, and she became a sotāpanna. Feeling that he had 
paid his debt to his mother, he sent Cunda to fetch the monks, and, on their 
arrival, he sat up with Cunda’s help and asked if he had offended them in any 
way during the forty four years of his life as a monk. On receiving their 
assurance that he had been entirely blameless, he wiped his lips with his robe 
and lay down, and, after passing through various trances, died at break of dawn.</p>
<p>His mother made all arrangements for the funeral, and 
Vissakamma assisted in the ceremony. When the cremation was over, Anuruddha 
extinguished the flames with perfumed water, and Cunda gathered together the 
relics. This account is summarized from SA.iii.172ff.; similar accounts are 
found at DA.ii.549f, etc. Sāriputta’s death is also referred to at J.i.391.</p>
<p>Among those who came to pay honour to the pyre was the 
goddess Revatī (q.v.). Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika (October 
to November) preceding the Buddha’s death, and Moggallāna died a fortnight 
later. SA.iii.181; J.i.391; both Sāriputta and Moggallāna were older than the 
Buddha because they were born “anuppanne yeva hi Buddhe” (DhA.i.73).</p>
<p>Sāriputta had many pupils, some of whom have already been 
mentioned. Among others were Kosiya, Kandhadinna, Cullasārī, Vanavāsika Tissa, 
Sankicca (q.v.), and Sarabhū, who brought to Ceylon the Buddha’s collar bone, 
which he deposited in the Mahiyangana-cetiya (Mhv.i.37f). Sāriputta’s brother, 
Upavāna, predeceased him, and Sāriputta was with him when he died of snake bite 
at Sappasondikapabbāra (S.iv.40f).</p>
<p>Sāriputta’s special proficiency was in the Abhidhamma. It 
is said (DhSA.16f., DA.i.15, where it is said that at the end of the First 
Recital the Abhidhamma was given in charge of five hundred arahants, Sāriputta 
being already dead) that when preaching the Abhidhamma, to the gods of 
Tāvatimsa, the Buddha would visit Anotatta every day, leaving a nimitta Buddha, 
on Sakka’s throne to continue the preaching. After having bathed in the lake he 
would take his midday rest. During this time Sāriputta would visit him and learn 
from the Buddha all that had been preached of the Abhidhamma during the previous 
day. Having thus learnt the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta taught it to his five hundred 
pupils. Their acquirement of the seven books of the Abhidhamma coincided with 
the conclusion of the Buddha’s sermon in Tāvatimsa. Thus the textual order of 
the Abhidhamma originated with Sāriputta, and the numerical series was 
determined by him.</p>
