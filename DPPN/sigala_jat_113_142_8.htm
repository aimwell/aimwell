<p><b>1. Sigāla Jātaka (No.113).</b> The people of Benares 
once held a sacrifice to the Yakkhas, placing meat and liquor in their 
courtyards. A jackal, who entered the city through a sewer, regaled himself with 
food and drink and then went to sleep in some bushes in the city. He did not 
awake till morning, and then, looking for a way of escape, met a brahmin. 
Promising to show him a spot where lay hidden two hundred pieces of gold, he 
persuaded the brahmin to carry him out of the city in his waist cloth. Arrived 
at the cemetery, he asked the brahmin to spread his robe and dig under a tree. 
While the brahmin dug, the jackal fouled the robe and ran away. The Bodhisatta, 
then a tree sprite, advised the brahmin to wash his robe and cease being a fool.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is 
identified with the jackal. J.i.424 26.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sigāla Jātaka (No.142).</b> Once, during a festival 
in Benares, some rogues were drinking and eating till late at night, and when 
the meat was finished, one of them offered to go to the charnel field and kill a 
jackal for food. Taking a club, he lay down as though dead. The Bodhisatta, then 
king of the jackals, came there with his flock, but in order to make sure that 
it was a corpse, he pulled at the club. The man tightened his grip, and the 
Bodhisatta mocked at his silliness. The man then threw the club at the jackals, 
but they escaped.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is 
identified with the rogue. J.i.489f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sigāla Jātaka (No.148).</b> The Bodhisatta was once 
born as a jackal, and, coming across the dead body of an elephant, ate into it 
from behind and lived inside it. When the body dried up, he became a prisoner 
and made frenzied efforts to escape. Then a storm broke, moistening the hide and 
allowing him to emerge through the head, but not without losing all his hair as 
he crawled through. He thereupon resolved to renounce greediness.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to five hundred 
companions, rich men of Sāvatthi, who joined the Order. One night the Buddha 
perceived that they were filled with thoughts of lust. He therefore sent Ānanda 
to summon all the monks in the monastery, and told this tale to illustrate the 
evil effects of desire. The five hundred monks became arahants. J.i.601f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sigāla Jātaka (No.152). </b>The Bodhisatta was once 
a lion with six brothers and one sister. When the lions were away after food, a 
jackal who had fallen in love with the lioness told her of his love. She was 
greatly insulted, and resolved to tell her brothers and then die. The jackal 
slunk away and hid in a cave. One by one the lions came in, and when their 
sister told them of the insult, they tried to reach the jackal by leaping 
upwards, but perished in the attempt. At last came the Bodhisatta; being wise, 
be roared the lion’s roar three times and the jackal died. He then consoled his 
sister.</p>
<p>The story was told to a barber in Vesāli who served the 
king’s household. His son used to go with him to the palace, and, having fallen 
in love with a Licchavi girl, died of a broken heart because he could not have 
her. The barber, who was a pious follower of the Buddha, visited the Buddha some 
time after and told him of what had happened.</p>
<p>The jackal was the barber’s son, the lioness the Licchavi 
girl, and the six young lions the Chabbaggiyā. J.ii.5ff.</p>
