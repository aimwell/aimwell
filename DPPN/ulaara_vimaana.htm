<p>The daughter of a family in Rājagaha, 
which waited upon Mahā Moggallāna; was very generous and always gave away in 
alms the half of anything which she possessed. She was given in marriage to the 
son of a family of unbelievers. One day, seeing Moggallāna begging for alms, she 
invited him and gave him some cakes which had been put away by her 
mother-in-law. When the latter heard of it she was greatly enraged, and struck 
the girl with a pestle.</p>
<p>The girl died and was born in Tāvatimsa, 
her palace being called the Ulāravimāna. Later, Moggallāna visited her there 
(Vv.p.24; VvA.120).</p>
