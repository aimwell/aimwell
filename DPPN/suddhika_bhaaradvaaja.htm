  <h2>Suddhika-Bh훮radv훮ja</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A brahmin who visited the Buddha at Jetavana and stated 
that a man can be purified only by knowledge of the Vedas. The Buddha answered 
that it is not knowledge of runes, but the purity of heart of a man, which is 
important, of a man who has put forth effort to win supreme purity of conduct 
(S.i.165). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.179) that the brahmin was called 
Suddhika to distinguish him from other Bh훮radv훮jas by the nature of his enquiry.</p>
