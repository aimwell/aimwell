<p><b>2. Māgha.</b> A youth of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. He visited the 
Buddha at <a href="gijjhakuuta.htm" title="g/gijjhakuuta.htm">Gijjhakūta</a> and asked if he would gain greatly by the gifts he made to 
various people, gifts which were rightly obtained. The Buddha answered that his 
gifts would bear great fruit. At the end of the Buddha’s discourse, Māgha became 
his follower. SN. pp. 86ff.; SNA.ii.413ff.</p>

<p><b>4. Māgha.</b> A usurper from Kālinga who came to Ceylon 
with a band of Kerala warriors in about 1215 A.C., deposed the reigning king, 
Parakkamapandu II., blinded him, and occupied the throne at Pulatthipura. Being 
a bigoted Hindu, he destroyed the Buddhist religious buildings and burnt their 
books. He persecuted the people in various ways and distributed their land among 
his warriors. He ruled for twenty one years, and seems to have been succeeded at 
Pulatthipura by Jayabāhu (q.v.) (Cv.lxxx.58ff). During part of his reign, 
Vijayabāhu III. (q.v.) ruled over a portion of Ceylon. Cv.lxxxi.10ff.</p>
