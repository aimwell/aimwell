  <h2>Savittha Thera</h2>

</ul>
<p>In the Anguttara (A.i.118f) he is represented as saying, 
in the course of a conversation between him, Sāriputta and Kotthita, that he 
preferred the person who obtains relief by faith (saddhā), to one who testifies 
to the truth with the body or one who has won view. </p>
<p>The Commentary (AA.i.353) explains that Savittha himself 
won arahantship through faith, and that therefore he praises faith. </p>
<p>The Samyutta (S.ii.115) contains two conversations of 
Savittha, both of which took place at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī. The first is 
with Musīla and deals with the paticcasamuppāda. Musīla, in answer to Savittha’s 
questions, says that he has realized the truth of the paticcasamuppāda as his 
very own. “Then you are an arahant,” says Savittha, and Musīla remains silent. 
In the other conversation, Nārada, present at the discussion, in the company of 
Ānanda, requests that the same questions be put to him. This Savittha does, and 
he tells Savittha that he has realized the truth of the Paticcasamuppāda by 
right insight and that, yet, he is not an arahant. He is like a man who sees a 
well containing water, but who has neither rope nor vessel. “Now, what will you 
say of Nārada?” asks Ānanda. “Nothing that is not lovely and good,” answers 
Savittha.</p>
