<hr>
<p><b>1. Bhaddā.</b> One of the two chief women disciples 
  of Revata Buddha. J.i.35; Bu.vi.22.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhaddā.</b> One of the chief women patrons of 
  Kassapa Buddha. Bu.xxv.41.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhaddā.</b> Wife of King Munda. At her death the 
  king placed her body in a vessel of oil and mourned for her until his friend 
  Piyaka took him to Nārada Thera at the Kukkutārāma, and there made him realize 
  the folly of mourning. A.iii.57ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhaddā.</b> A woman of Kimbila; she was the wife of Rohaka. 
</p>
<p>She became famous in the city as a virtuous woman (bhadditthī) 
on account of her goodness and was admired even by the gods. One festival day, 
while her husband was away in Takkasilā on business, she greatly longed to be 
with him. The spirit of the house conveyed her thither, and from their union a 
child was born. Her virtue was doubted by her relations, but she convinced them 
by arresting a flood with an “Act of Truth.” Her husband was also suspicious, 
but she convinced him by producing a signet ring, which he had given her in 
Takkasilā. Thus she became famous through her virtue. After death she was born 
in Tāvatimsa, where she met the Buddha on his visit there, and at his request 
related to him her story. Vv.ii.5; VvA.109ff.</p>
