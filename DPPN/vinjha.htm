<p><b>2. Viñjha, Viñjhātavi.</b> The Vindhyā mountains and 
the forests surrounding them, through which lay the road from Tāmalitti to 
Pātaliputta. Along this road Asoka travelled bearing the Bodhi tree (Mhv.xix.6; 
Dpv.xvi.2). This was also the road leading from Ceylon to Pātaliputta 
(Dpv.xv.87). Near the forest was a great monastery from which sixty thousand 
monks, led by Uttara, went to attend the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa 
(Mhv.xx.ix.40). At the foot of the mountain was a market town named Munda. 
DhA.iv.128 ; elsewhere, however e.g. Sp.iii.655, Viñjhātavi is described as 
agāmakam araññam.</p>
<p>The forest was the abode of petas. See, e.g., PvA. 43, 
192, 244.</p>
