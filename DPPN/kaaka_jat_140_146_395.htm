<p>1. Kāka Jātaka (No.140).-The Bodhisatta 
was once born as a crow. One day a crow dropped filth on the king’s chaplain as 
he was returning from the bath arrayed in all his splendour. He thereupon 
conceived hatred against all crows. Soon after that a woman slave, watching some 
rice spread out in the sun to dry, was angered by a goat who, as soon as she 
fell asleep, started to eat the rice. In exasperation she fetched a torch and 
struck the goat’s shaggy back, which caught fire. To ease its pain, the goat ran 
into the hayshed near the king’s elephant-stalls and rolled in the hay. In the 
conflagration that ensued many of the elephants were badly burnt, and when the 
chaplain was consulted, remembering his anger against crows, he said that the 
cure for burns was crows' fat. Crows were accordingly being mercilessly 
slaughtered; the Bodhisatta, hearing of this sought the king and explained to 
him the chaplain’s motive. Crows had no fat, he said, because their life is 
passed in ceaseless dread. The king, being greatly pleased with the Bodhisatta’s 
act, granted immunity to all living beings, showing particular favour towards 
crows.</p>
<p>The circumstances which led to the 
recital of the story are described in the Bhaddasāla Jātaka (q.v.). The king in 
the story was Ānanda.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kāka Jātaka (No.146).-Once a crow 
came with his mate to the seashore and ate freely of the remnants of a sacrifice 
which had been offered by men to the Nāgas and drank freely of the strong drink 
which he found. Both crows became drunk, and, while trying to swim in the surf, 
the hen-crow was washed into the sea and eaten by a fish. Hearing the husband’s 
lamentations, many crows gathered together and started to empty the ocean, 
working away until ready to drop from weariness. Seeing their plight, the 
Bodhisatta, who was then a sea-sprite, caused a bogey to appear from the sea, 
frightening them away.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
number of monks who had joined the Order in their old age. They went for alms to 
their former wives' and children’s houses, and gathering together at the house 
of the wife of one of them (she being particularly beautiful), placed together 
what each had received and ate it with sauces and curries prepared by the 
beautiful wife. The woman died, and the aged monks, returning to the monastery, 
wept aloud for their benefactress, the giver of sauces. The matter was reported 
to the Buddha, who identified the crows of the past with the foolish monks 
(J.i.497-9).</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary 
(iii.422), the name of the woman was Madhurapācikā.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Kāka Jātaka (No.395).-The Bodhisatta 
was once a pigeon and lived in a net basket in the kitchen of a Benares 
merchant. A greedy crow, becoming intimate with him, came to live there. The 
cook discovered the crow trying to steal some food, and, pulling out his 
feathers, sprinkled him with flour, hung a chowrie round his neck and flung him 
into the basket.</p>
<p>The story closely resembles those of the 
Kapota Jātaka and the Lola Jātaka (q.v.), and is related in reference to a 
greedy monk (J.iii.314-16; see also Cunningham: Bharhut Stūpa, xlv. Pl.7).</p>
<p>The Kapota Jātaka (J.i.241) makes 
reference to a Kaka Jātaka of the Navani-pāta. There is no such story in the 
Ninth Book; perhaps it is a wrong reading for the Cakkavāka Jātaka (No.434), 
where the story is also related with reference to a greedy monk.</p>
