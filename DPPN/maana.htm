<p><b>1. Māna. </b>Youngest brother and viceroy of Aggabodhi 
III. (Sirisanghabodhi). He was governor of Dakkhinadesa. He was later found 
guilty of an offence in the women’s apartments of the palace and was 
treacherously killed by the court officers. Cv.xliv.84,123f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Māna.</b> Eldest son of Kassapa II. (Cv.xlv.6) His 
full name was Mānavamma. (Regarding these names, Māna and Mānavamma, see Cv. 
Trs.i.192, n. 3.). He was very young when his father died, and, when the 
government fell into the hands of Dappula I. and later of Dāthopatissa II., he 
left Uttaradesa, where he was living in retirement with his wife Sanghā, and 
went to Jambudīpa, there to take service under the Pallava king, Narasīha (for 
details see Cv.xivii.9ff., 15ff). He won the king’s favor and very loyally 
helped him to defeat the Vallabha king. He then raised an army with the help of 
Narasīha, landed in Ceylon, and recovered the kingdom from Dāthopatissa. But 
later his army deserted him on hearing tidings of Narasīha’s illness and Māna 
returned once more to Jambudīpa. Some time after he came again to Ceylon with a 
large army and defeated Hatthadātha, the reigning king, and his general 
Potthakuttha. In the confusion which followed, Hatthadātha was killed and 
Potthakuttha was poisoned at Merukandara. Māna thereupon became king and did 
many acts of merit, including the erection of the Padhānarakkha&nbsp; and the 
Sirisanghabodhi vihāras, also the Sepanni&nbsp; and Siri pāsādas. Māna was a 
supporter of the Pamsukūlins. Cv.xlvii.1ff. Mānavamma reigned circa 676 711 A.C.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Māna </b>(also called Mānavamma). He was the nephew 
of Kassapa II. and the son of Dappula I. Kassapa handed over the kingdom to him 
at the time of his death, his own children being very young. When Kassapa died, 
the Damilas attacked Ceylon, but Māna, with his father’s help, repulsed them and 
crowned his father king. When Hatthadātha heard of this, he came with a large 
force and seized the throne under the name of Dāthopatissa II. Māna went to the 
Eastern Province, while Dappula returned to Rohana. Later, Māna led a rebellion 
against Dāthopatissa and was killed in battle (Cv.xlv.1ff.; 52, 77ff). His 
mother was the sister of Kassapa II. and the daughter of King Silāmeghavanna. Cv. 
Trs.i.94, n. 1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Māna.</b> Called Mūlapotthakī. He was an officer of 
Parakkamabāhu I. and, in one campaign, defeated Lokagalla Vikkama at Mahāgāma. 
Cv.lxxv.139f.</p>
