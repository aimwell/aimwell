<p>He was born in the family of an elephant driver of 
Sāvatthi and became expert in elephant lore. One day, while training an elephant 
by the river, he felt that it would be better if he were to train himself. So he 
went to the Buddha, heard him preach, and, having entered the Order, attained 
arahantship (Thag.vs.77; ThagA.i.170f).</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder. Having 
seen the Buddha, he offered him flowers and paid him homage. Forty one kappas 
ago he was a king, named Varana. He is probably identical with Ganthipupphiya 
Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.162.</p>
