<p>A chain of mountains in Majjhimadesa. 
Not far away from it was a very populous town on a river. In this river many 
mere bathed, and along its banks sat beautiful courtesans tempting them. It was 
one of these courtesans that tempted the sage Nārada (J.iii.463).</p>
<p>Arañjagiri was one of the places passed 
by Vessantara and his family on their way from their home to Vankagiri. From the 
city of Jetuttara to Suvannagiritāla was five leagues and it was five leagues 
more to Kontimāra; thence to Arañjaragiri was five and again five to 
Dunni-vittha (J.vi.514). This was the road followed by banished men (J.vi.493) (v.l. 
Arañjara°).</p>
