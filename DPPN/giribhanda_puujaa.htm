<p>A great festival, instituted by King 
Mahādāthika-Mahānāga on the Cetiyagiri mountain. Carpets were laid from the 
Kadambanadī to the mountain, in order that people might approach the mountain 
with clean feet; the road was decorated and illuminated, shops were erected and 
largesse distributed. There were mimes, songs and music. Lamps were lit 
throughout the island and even on the sea for one yojana round (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff; 
AA.i.13). It is said (Vsm.376; Vsm.Trs.ii.436, n.4) that on the day of the 
festival Māra, wishing to spoil it, rained down a shower of coal, but an Elder 
created earth in the sky, thus preventing the coal from falling. The most costly 
offerings given during this feast to any monk — namely, a pair of garments — 
fell to the lot of a young novice, Lonagirivāsī Tissa, in spite of the efforts 
of the king’s ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks. It was 
because the novice had practised the sārānīya-dhammā (DA.ii.535; AA.ii.653f; 
MA.i.545f).</p>
<p>The festival was probably connected with 
the Giribhanda-vihāra, in which case that was the reason for the name.</p>
