<p>Two suttas on the same theme. The monk 
worthy to be called a dhammavihārī is not one who has mastered the Dhamma nor 
one who teaches it to others, neither is he one who repeats it by heart nor who 
reflects on it, but he is one who, having learnt the Dhamma, dwells apart and 
devotes himself to attaining calmness of self. A.iii.86.</p>
