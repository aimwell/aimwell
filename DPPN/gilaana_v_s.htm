<hr>
<p>1. Gilāna Vagga.-The thirteenth chapter 
of the Pañcaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.142-7).</p>
<p>2. Gilāna Vagga.-The eighth chapter of 
the Salāyatana Samyutta. S.iv.46-53.</p>
<p>3. Gilāna Vagga.-The second chapter of 
the Bojjhanga Samyutta. S.v.78.83.</p>
<p>1. Gilāna Sutta.-There are three types 
of sick men — those who will not, in any case, recover; those who recover 
whether looked after or not; those who recover only if properly looked after. 
Even so, there are three kinds of men — those who will never, whether they hear 
the Dhamma or not, enter into an assurance of perfection, etc. A.i.120f.</p>
<p>2. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits a 
sick novice of no reputation and talks to him. The novice, pondering on the 
Buddha’s words, re-covers. S.iv.46; cf. S.iii.119.</p>
<p>3. Gilāna Sutta.-The same as the above, 
except that the topic is final emancipation without grasping (anupādā 
parinibbāna). S.iv.47.</p>
<p>4. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits Mahā 
Kassapa lying ill in the Pippalīguhā, and talks to him of the seven bojjhangas. 
Delighted with the talk, Kassapa recovers. S.v.79.</p>
<p>5. Gilāna Sutta.-Describes a similar 
visit to Mahā Moggallāna at Gijjhakūta. S.iv.80.</p>
<p>6. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha lies ill in 
the Kalandakanivāpa in Veluvana; Mahā Cunda visits him, and they talk of the 
seven bojjhangas. The Buddha immediately recovers. S.v.81.</p>
<p>7. Gilāna Sutta.-Once, shortly before 
his death, the Buddha spent the rainy season in Beluva, where he became 
seriously ill. By great effort of will he overcame the sickness. Ānanda 
expresses his admiration for the Buddha’s strength of mind, but adds his 
conviction that the Buddha would not die without having made some pronouncement 
concerning the Order. Then follows the Buddha’s famous injunction to his 
followers that they should take no other guide or refuge but the Dhamma and 
their own selves. S.v.152f.; the sutta is found almost verbatim in D.ii.98f.</p>
<p>8. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits the 
sick ward in the Kūtāgārasāla in Vesāli and talks to a sick monk, telling him 
that by practising five things during illness one can be sure of the speedy 
destruction of the āsavas, these things being asubhānupassanā, 
āhārepatikūlasaññā, sabba-loke anabhiratasaññā, sabbasankhāresu aniccānupassanā 
and marana-saññā. A.iii.142; cf. Giri Sutta.</p>
