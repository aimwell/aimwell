  <h2>Cakka-vatti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The special name given in the books to a 
World ruler. The world itself means “Turner of the Wheel,” the Wheel (Cakka) 
being the well known Indian symbol of empire. There are certain stock epithets 
used to describe a Cakka-vatti: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>dhammiko, dhammarājā, cāturanto (ruler 
  of the four quarters), </li>
  <li>
  <p>vijitāvī (conqueror), </li>
  <li>
  <p>janapadatthavāriyappatto (guardian of 
  the people’s good), and </li>
  <li>
  <p>sattaratanasamannāgato (possessor of 
  the Seven Treasures). </li>
</ul>
<p>More than one thousand sons are his; his 
dominions extend throughout the earth to its ocean bounds (sāgarapariyantam); 
and is established not by the scourge, nor by the sword, but by righteousness (adandena 
asatthena dhammen'eva abhivijiva). Particulars are found chiefly in the 
Mahāsudassana, Mahāpadāna, Cakkavattisīhanāda, Bālapandita and Ambattha Suttas. 
See also S.v.98.</p>
<p>From the <a href="mahapadana_s.htm" title="maha/mahapadana_s.htm">Mahāpadāna Sutta</a> it would 
appear that the birth of a Cakka-vatti is attended by the same miracles as that 
of the birth of a Buddha. A Cakka-vatti’s youth is the same as that of Buddha; 
he, too, possesses on his body the <a href="mahapurisa.htm" title="maha/mahapurisa.htm">Mahāpurisalakkhanāni</a>, and sooth-sayers 
are able to predict at the child’s birth only that one of two destinies await 
him.</p>
<p>Of the Seven Treasures of a Cakka-vatti, 
the <a href="cakkaratana.htm" title="c/cakkaratana.htm">Cakkaratana</a> is the chief. When he has traversed the Four Continents:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p><a href="pubbavideha.htm" title="pu/pubbavideha.htm">Pubbavideha</a></li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a></li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="aparagoyaana.htm" title="ay/aparagoyaana.htm">Aparagoyāna</a></li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="uttarakuru.htm" title="u/uttarakuru.htm">Uttarakuru</a></li>
</ol>
<p>accompanied by the Cakkaratana, received 
the allegiance of all the inhabitants and admonished them to lead the righteous 
life, he returns to his own native city. </p>
<p>After the Wheel, other Treasures make 
their appearance: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>first the Elephant, Hatthiratana; it 
  is either the youngest of the Chaddanta-kula or the oldest of the Uposatha-kula.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Next the Horse, Assaratana, named 
  <a href="valaahaka.htm" title="va/valaahaka.htm">Valāhaka</a>, all white with crow black head, and dark mane, able to fly through 
  the air. </li>
  <li>
  <p>Then the <a href="v2_ve.htm#Veluriya" title="va/v2_ve.htm#Veluriya">Veluriya</a>-gem from Vepullapabbata, with eight facets, the finest of its species, shedding light 
  for a league around. </li>
  <li>
  <p>This is followed by the Woman, 
  belonging either to the royal family of Madda or of Uttarakuru, desirable in 
  every way, both because of her physical beauty and her virtuous character.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Then the Treasurer (Gahapati) 
  possessed of marvellous vision, enabling him to discover treasures, 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>and then the Adviser (Parināyaka), who 
  is generally the Cakka-vatti’s eldest son. </li>
</ul>
<p>(For descriptions of these see D.ii.174f; 
DA.ii.624f; MA.ii.941f ).</p>
<p>Judging from the story of <a href="mahasudassana_s.htm" title="maha/mahasudassana_s.htm">Mahāsudassana</a>, who is the typical Cakka-vatti, the World emperor has also four other 
gifts (iddhi): </p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>a marvellous figure, </li>
  <li>
  <p>a life longer than that of other men, 
  good health, </li>
  <li>
  <p>and popularity with all classes of his 
  subjects. </li>
  <li>
  <p>The perfume of sandalwood issues from 
  his mouth, while his body is like a lily.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Cakka-vatti is about to die the 
Wheel slips down from its place and sinks down slightly. When the king sees this 
he leaves the household life, and retires into homelessness, to taste the joys 
of contemplation, having handed over the kingdom to his eldest son. At the 
king’s death, the Elephant, the Horse and the Gem return to where they came 
from, the Woman loses her beauty, the Treasurer his divine vision, and the 
Adviser his efficiency (DA.ii.635).</p>
<p>Cakka-vattis are rare in the world, and 
are born in kappas in which Buddhas do not arise (SA.iii.131). 
The <a href="cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm" title="c/cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm">Cakkavattisīhanāda Sutta</a>, however, gives the names of seven who 
succeeded one another. In the case of each of them the Wheel disappeared, but, 
when his successor practised the Ariyan duty of a Cakka-vatti, honouring the 
Dhamma and following it to perfection, the Wheel re-appeared. In the case of the 
seventh his virtues gradually disappeared through forgetfulness; crime spread, 
among his subjects, and the Wheel vanished for ever.</p>
<p>In the earlier literature the term 
Cakka-vatti seems to have been reserved for a World ruler; but later three sorts 
of Cakka-vattis are mentioned: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>cakkavāla- or cāturanta-cakkavatti 
  (ruling over the four continents), </li>
  <li>
  <p>dīpa-cakkavatti (ruling over one), and
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>padesacakkavatti (over part of one). 
  (DA.i.249)</li>
</ol>
<p>No woman can become a Cakka-vatti (the 
reasons for this are given at AA.i.254). </p>
<p>A Cakka-vatti is, as worthy of a thūpa as 
a Buddha. D.ii.143.</p>
