  <h2>Sunāga</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The son of a brahmin of Nālakagāma, a friend of Sāriputta 
before the latter left the world. Later, Sunāga heard the Buddha preach, entered 
the Order, and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha, thirty one kappas ago, he was 
a brahnnin versed in the Vedas, and lived in a forest hut near Mount Vasabha as 
teacher of three thousand pupils. One day he met Sikhī Buddha, and, knowing by 
the signs on his body that he was a Buddha of infinite wisdom, he was suffused 
with joy, as a result of which he was born after death in the deva world. Twenty 
seven kappas ago he was a king named Siridhara (Thag.vs.85; ThagA.i.182).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Rahosaññaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.166f.</p>
