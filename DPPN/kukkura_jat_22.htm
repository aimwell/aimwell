<p>1. Kukkura Jātaka (No 22).-Because his 
carriage straps, left in the rain, are gnawed by his own dogs, the king of 
Benares orders all dogs except his own to be killed indiscriminately. The 
Bodhisatta, who is the leader of the pack of dogs in the cemetery, visits the 
king, points out to him his iniquity, and reveals the truth by causing an emetic 
to be administered to the king’s dogs. Having convinced the king, the Bodhisatta 
teaches him the ten stanzas of Righteousness found in the Tesakuna Jātaka (dhammañ 
cara mahārāja, etc.) (J.v.123). Great are the benefactions made to dogs 
thereafter. The Bodhisatta’s teaching lasted for ten thousand years under the 
name of Kukkurovāda.</p>
<p>The king is identified with Ānanda 
(J.i.175ff). The occasion for the story is given in the Bhaddasāla Jātaka.</p>
