  <h2>Kuhakābrāhmana Vatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A certain brahmin would climb a tree, 
grasp a branch with his feet and, swinging head downwards like a bat, demand 
pennies, etc., from passers by, threatening to kill himself and destroy the city 
if his request were refused. The Buddha hearing of this related a Jātaka story 
in which a false ascetic, having received some lizard meat, liked it and wished 
for more. He lay in wait for the king of the lizards when the latter came to pay 
his respects to him in order to kill him, but the lizard-king, suspecting him, 
escaped, reproaching him for his hypocrisy. DhA.iv.153ff; cp. the Godha Jātaka; 
also J.i.480f and ii.382f.</p>
