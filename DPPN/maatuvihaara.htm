<p><b>1. Mātuvihāra.</b> A vihāra built by King Saddhātissa. 
Mhv.xxxiii.9.</p>

<p><b>2. Mātuvihāra</b>. A vihāra built by the mother of 
Gajabāhukagāmanī, on the spot where, in a thicket of flowering kadambas, she had 
met an ascetic rising from a trance of seven days and had given him food which 
she was taking to her father the brick worker. As a result of this gift she 
became the queen of Vankanāsikatissa. Later she bought the piece of land for one 
thousand and built there the vihāra. Gajabāhukagāmanī built a stone thūpa 
connected with it and gave lands to the monks of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.104ff., 
115ff). The full name of this vihāra seems to have been Rājamātuvihāra (q.v.). 
MT. 656.</p>
