<p>King. He was a poor man of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He 
saved a halfpenny (addha-māsaka) and hid it in a brick wall. When the festival 
came round, wishing to take part in the fun with his wife, who had also saved a 
halfpenny, he travelled six leagues in the hot sun to fetch his savings from the 
hiding-place. King Udaya saw him as he passed by the palace singing, and having 
discovered his mission, gave him half of his kingdom. The man chose the half in 
which his halfpenny lay concealed. He later became an ascetic. His story is 
given in the Gangamāla Jātaka (J.iii.449 ff.; iv.174). He was Ānanda in the 
present age. J.iii.454.</p>
