  <h2>Macchuddāna Jātaka (No. 288)</h2>
  </li>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once the son of a landed proprietor, 
and, after his father’s death, he and his younger brother went to a village to 
settle some business. On their way back, they had a meal out of a leaf bottle, 
and, when they had finished, the Bodhisatta threw the remains into the river for 
the fish, giving the merit to the river spirit. The power of the river spirit 
increased and she discovered the cause. The younger brother was of a dishonest 
disposition, and when the elder was asleep, he packed a parcel of gravel to 
resemble the money they were carrying and put them both away. While they were in 
mid river he stumbled against the side of the boat and dropped overboard what he 
thought to be the parcel of gravel, but what was really the money. He told the 
Bodhisatta about it who said, “Never mind, what’s gone has gone.” But the river 
spirit out of gratitude to the Bodhisatta made a fish swallow the parcel. The 
fish was later caught and hawked about, and, owing again to the influence of the 
spirit, the fisherman asked one thousand pieces and seven annas for it, and the 
people laughed at what they thought was a joke. But when they came to the 
Bodhisatta’s house, they offered him the fish for seven annas. The fish was 
bought and cut open by his wife, and the money was given to him. At that instant 
the river spirit informed him of what she had done and asked him to have no 
consideration for his brother, who was a thief and was greatly disappointed at 
the failure of his trick. But the Bodhisatta sent him five hundred pieces.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a dishonest merchant 
who is identified with the cheat. J.ii.423-6.</p>
