  <h2>Pindolya Sutta</h2>

<p>The Buddha retires for his siesta to the Mahāvana, near 
Kapilavatthu, and the thought occurs to him that he should admonish the monks 
and look after them tenderly as some of them had only lately joined the Order. 
Sahampatī appears before him and confirms his intention. The Buddha thereupon 
goes to the Nigrodhārāma, makes the monks come to him in ones and twos, and 
talks to them. The life of a recluse is the meanest of callings&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
be called a “scrap gatherer.” It is entered on by householders solely as a means 
of escaping from woe. The man who leaves the world and who yet does not fulfil 
the life of a recluse, is like a faggot from a funeral pyre, burnt at both ends 
and smeared with filth. Therefore should the monks shun thoughts of lust, ill 
will and hurt, and practise the four satipatthānas. Thus will they obtain 
release. S.iii.91ff.</p>
