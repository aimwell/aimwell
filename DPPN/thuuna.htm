  <h2>Thūna</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A brahmin village on the western 
boundary of Majjhimadesa (Vin.i.197; AA.i.56, 205; MA.397, etc; J.i.49). 
It was in the Kosala country and belonged to the Mallas, and was once visited by 
the Buddha. </p>
<p>The people of Thūna were unbelievers 
and, hearing of the Buddha’s contemplated visit, they removed all the boats of 
the river which the Buddha had to cross, closed all the wells except one and 
determined not to honour the Buddha in any way. </p>
<p>The Buddha arrived with the monks 
through the air and a slave-woman, coming to fetch water, saw them and gave them 
to drink. For this, she was beaten by her husband and killed; but she was reborn 
in Tāvatimsa. </p>
<p>The Buddha, by his power, caused the 
water in the wells to overflow and flood the village. The inhabitants begged his 
forgiveness and invited him and the monks to stay there. Vv.i.8; VvA.45ff.
</p>
<p>The Buddha’s visit is described at 
Ud.vii.9 (UdA.377), but no mention is made there of the slave-woman.</p>
<p>A city called Thūna is mentioned in the 
Mahājanaka Jātaka (J.vi.62, 65).</p>
