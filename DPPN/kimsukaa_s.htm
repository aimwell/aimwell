<p>A monk asks a fellow-monk as to when a 
monk’s insight is said to be fully purified. When he really understands the 
arising and the passing away of the six-fold sense sphere answers the other. Not 
being satisfied, the first monk asks others who, in turn, declare in similar 
terms of the five upādānakkhandhas, the four mahābhūtas, etc. Finally he asks 
the Buddha, who says that the answers of the monks were like those of men who, 
on being asked what the kimsuka (Judas) tree was like, describe it, not as it 
really is, but as each one of them happens to have seen it. The Buddha explains 
the monk’s question by means of the parable of a city, strongly guarded, having 
six gates and a watchful warden of the gates, receiving messengers from various 
quarters (S.iv.191ff). Cf. Kimsukopama Jātaka.</p>
