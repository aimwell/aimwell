<h4>1. Pingiya</h4>
<p>Chaplain to <a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>, king of Benares. He was a former 
birth of <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> (J.iii.161). His story is given in the
<a href="dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm" title="d/dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm">Dhonasākha Jātaka</a> 
(q.v.).</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pingiya</h4>
<p>Called Pingiya mānava, nephew and pupil of <a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a>. At the 
time that he visited the Buddha with the other disciples he was 120 years old 
and very feeble. At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, as recorded in 
the Pingiya Sutta (SN. vs. 1120 23), because of his feebleness, he failed to 
reach any attainment. Thereupon he praised the Buddha and begged of him to go 
on. The Buddha preached to him further, and he became an anāgāmī, failing, 
however, to attain arahantship because his mind wandered to his maternal uncle, 
Bāvarī. His one thousand pupils, however, became arahants. Later, with the 
Buddha’s leave, he visited Bāvarī and told him the glad tidings, describing the 
Buddha’s glory (SN.vs.1131 45). At the end of his statement, the Buddha, seeing 
that the minds of both of them were mature, sent forth a ray of light from 
Sāvatthi and, appearing before them, preached to them. Thereupon Bāvarī became 
an anāgāmī and Pingiya an arahant (SNA.ii.603ff).</p>
<p>Pingiya was called mānava, even at the age of 120. 
(SNA.ii.413).</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Pingiya</h4>
<p>One of the seven anāgamīns born in the Avihā world, in the 
company of Ghatīkārā (S.i.35, 60). He is described as a bhikkhū, and is 
therefore probably identical with Pingiya (2). The story of the latter having 
attained arahantship must, in that case, have been a later legend. It is also 
possible that Pingiya is a variant reading for <a href="pingiyani.htm" title="pu/pingiyani.htm">Pingiyānī</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Pingiya</h4>
<p>A dog, mentioned in the <a href="putimamsa.htm" title="pu/putimamsa.htm">Pūtimamsa Jātaka</a>. J.iii.535.</p>
