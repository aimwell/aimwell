  <h2>Assalāyana</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A young brahmin, sixteen years old, of 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, very learned in the Vedas and allied subjects. Five hundred brahmins 
staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> and refute 
his views. He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said, 
<a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a> was 
a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in 
controversy.  </p>
<p>He visits the Buddha and asks what he has to say concerning the 
claims of the brahmins to be the only superior class, the legitimate sons of 
Brahma.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Buddha points out to him that such pretensions are baseless, and 
that virtue, which alone leads to purity, can be cultivated by <b>any</b> of the four 
classes. </li>
</ul>
<p>Assalāyana sits silent and upset at the end of the discourse, but when 
the Buddha relates to him a story of the past where <a href="asita_devala.htm" title="ay/asita_devala.htm">Asita Devala</a> had defeated 
brahmins who held these same views, Assalāyana feels relieved and expresses his 
admiration of the Buddha’s exposition. He declares himself a follower of the 
Buddha (M.ii.147ff). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.785) tells us further that Assalāyana 
became a devoted follower of the faith and built a cetiya in his own residence 
for worship, and that all his descendants, down to Buddhaghosa’s day, built 
similar cetiyas in their houses.</p>
<p>Assalāyana is probably to be identified 
with the father of <a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahākotthita</a>, his wife being Candavati. There is, 
however, one difficulty connected with this theory: Mahākotthita says that he 
was won over to the faith after hearing the same sermon of the Buddha as 
converted his father (yadā me pitaram Buddho vinayī sabbasuddhiyā) (ThagA.i.31; 
Ap.ii.480). It is unlikely, if the identification be correct, that this refers 
to the Assalāyana Sutta, because at the time of that Sutta, Assalāyana was only 
sixteen years old; but there exists no record of any other sutta preached to 
Assalāyana, dealing with “sabbasuddhi.”</p>
<p>Assalayāna’s name occurs in a list of 
eminent brahmins found in the Sutta-Nipāta Commentary (i.372).</p>
