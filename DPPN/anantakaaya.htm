<p>An attendant of King <a href="milinda.htm" title="me_mu/milinda.htm">Milinda</a> who was 
sent by the king to escort <a href="nagasena.htm" title="n/nagasena.htm">Nāgasena</a> from the monastery to
<a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sāgala</a>. </p>
<p>On his way he questioned the Elder about 
the soul and we are told that the latter talked to him from the Abhidhamma to 
such effect that Anantakāya became a convert (Mil.30-1). </p>
<p>He is probably to be identified with 
Antiochus, attendant of Menander. Milinda Questions, I.xix., xlii.</p>
