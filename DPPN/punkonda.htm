<p>A Damila chief, ally of Kulasekhara; he fought against 
M훮lavacakkavatti and captured Semponm훮ri. Later, he surrendered to Lank훮pura and 
received much honour; but he then deserted Lank훮pura, who had his palace burnt 
down. The last we hear of him is of his alliance with Nigaladha. Cv.lxxvi.139, 
240, 273, 277, 278, 280, 299, 301; lxxvii.57, 92.</p>
