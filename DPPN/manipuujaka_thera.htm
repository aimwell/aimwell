<p><b>1. Manipūjaka Thera.</b> An arahant. Ninety four kappas 
ago he was an ascetic, and, having seen the Buddha (? Padumuttara), gave him a 
jewelled seat. Twelve kappas ago he was king eight times under the name of 
Sataramsī. Ap.i.190.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Manipūjaka Thera.</b> An arahant. He was once a Nāga 
king in a lake in Himavā, and, having seen Padumuttara Buddha travelling through 
the air, he offered him the jewel which he wore round his throat, that being the 
only thing he had (Ap.ii.413f). He is probably identical with Mātangaputta 
Thera. ThagA.i.349.</p>
