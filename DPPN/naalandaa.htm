<h4>1. Nālandā</h4>
<p>A town near <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, (according to 
<a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a>, DA.i.35) 
one league away. The Buddha is mentioned as having several times stayed there 
during his residence in Pāvārika’s mango grove, and while there he had 
discussions with <a href="upaali.htm#Gahapati" title="u/upaali.htm#Gahapati">Upāli-Gahapati</a> and 
<a href="diighatapassii.htm" title="d/diighatapassii.htm">Dīghatapassī</a> (S.ii.110; M.i.376ff.), with 
<a href="kevatta.htm" title="ku/kevatta.htm">Kevatta</a> (D.i.211ff.), and also several conversations with 
<a href="asibandhakaputta.htm" title="ay/asibandhakaputta.htm">Asibandhakaputta</a> (S. 
ii. 311 23). </p>
<p>The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> visited Nālandā during his last tour through 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, and it was there that 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> uttered his “lion’s roar,” affirming 
his faith in the Buddha, shortly before his death (D.ii.81f.; iii.99ff.; 
S.v.159ff.). The road from Rājagaha to Nālandā passed through 
<a href="ambalatthikaa.htm" title="am/ambalatthikaa.htm">Ambalatthikā</a> 
(D.ii.81; Vin.ii.287), and from Nālandā it went on to 
<a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaligāma</a> (D.ii.84). 
Between Rājagaha and Nālandā was situated the <a href="bahuputta.htm" title="b/bahuputta.htm">Bahuputta cetiya</a> (S.ii.220).
</p>
<p>According to the <a href="kevatta_s.htm" title="ku/kevatta_s.htm">Kevatta Sutta</a> (D.i.211), in the Buddha’s 
time Nālandā was already an influential and prosperous town, thickly populated, 
though it was not till later that it became the centre of learning for which it 
afterwards became famous. There is a record in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.322), 
of the town having been the victim of a severe famine during the Buddha’s time.</p>
<p>Nālandā was the residence of <a href="sonadinnaa.htm" title="s/sonadinnaa.htm">Sonnadinnā</a> (VvA.144). 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a> is several times mentioned as staying at Nālandā, 
which was evidently a centre of activity of the <a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Niganthas</a>.</p>
<p><a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hsouien Thsang</a> (Beal: op. cit., ii.167f ) gives several 
explanations of the name Nālandā. One is that it was named after the Nāga who 
lived in a tank in the middle of the mango grove. Another — 
and accepted by him — is that the Bodhisatta 
once had his capital here and gave “alms without intermission,” hence the name.</p>
<p>Nālanda is, in the northern 
books, given as the name of Sāriputta’s birthplace (see Nālaka). </p>
<p>Nālanda is identified with the modern Baragaon (CAGI. 
537).</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nālandā</h4>
<p>A village in the central province of Ceylon. Once 
Parakkamabāhu I. occupied a camp there, and it is several times mentioned in the 
accounts of his campaigns. Cv.lxx.167, 207; lxxii.169.</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Nālandā Sutta</h4>
<p>A conversation between the Buddha and Upāligahapati in 
Pāvārika’s mango grove, as to why some beings attain full freedom in this world 
while others do not. S.iv.110.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nālandā Sutta</h4>
<p>Sāriputta’s affirmation of faith in the Buddha — there 
never was, nor is, nor shall be, anyone possessing higher wisdom than the 
Buddha. S.v.159 f.; cp. D.ii.81 and D.iii.99ff.</p>
