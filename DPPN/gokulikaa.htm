<p>A secondary division of the Vajjiputtakā, 
their immediate parent-body being the Mahāsanghikas. Later, from the Gokulikas, 
sprang two other schools — the Paññattivādins and the Bāhulikas (or Bahussutikas) 
(Dpv.v.40; Mhv.v.4f.; Mbv., p.96). Their most important heresy seems to have 
been that they considered all sankhāras, without qualification, no better than a 
heap of embers (kukkula) whence the flames have died out as from an inferno of 
ashes. They based this view on the Buddha’s declaration made in the 
Adittapariyāya Sutta (“All is on fire, bhikkhus”) (Kvu.ii.7, p.208, and Points 
of Controversy, 127f). This view was probably responsible for their other name 
of (Kukkulikas or Kukkutikas) (Rockhill, 186ff). It may be that Kukkulika was 
their earlier name, of which Gokulikā was either a corruption or a derivation 
from the name of one of their teachers. But all Pāli records give only the “Gokulika” 
reading.</p>
