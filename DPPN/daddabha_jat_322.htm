  <h2>Daddabha Jātaka (No.322)</h2>

<p>Once a timid hare lying at the foot of a 
vilva tree heard a vilva fruit fall on a palm-leaf and, imagining that the world 
was collapsing, started to run. Other animals, alarmed by the sight, ran also 
until all the beasts of the forest were in headlong flight. The Bodhisatta, born 
as a lion, heard their story and calmed their fears.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
question asked of the Buddha by some monks, as to various austerities practised 
by ascetics. J.iii.74ff. The Jātaka is quoted at MA.i.313f.</p>
