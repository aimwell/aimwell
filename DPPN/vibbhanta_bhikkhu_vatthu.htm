<p>The story of a monk, living with Mahā Kassapa, who 
returned to lay life and associated with bad companions. One day Kassapa saw him 
being led to execution for some crime and asked him to recall the meditation 
which, in former days, had enabled him to gain the Fourth Jhāna. The man did so 
and was without fear. The executioners, finding him unconcerned with their 
punishments of him, took him to the king who, after enquiry, released him. Later 
he visited the Buddha and became an arahant. DhA.iv.52f.</p>
