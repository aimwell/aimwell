<p>A mountain in Ceylon, not far from 
Kacchakatittha, no the right bank of the Mahāvālukanadī. There Pandukābhaya 
defeated his uncles and occupied their fortified camp for two years. The 
mountain was the abode of yakkhas, and it was here that Pandukābhaya captured 
the Yakkhinī Cetiyā, near the pond Tumbariyangana in the vicinity of the 
mountain (Mhv.x.46, 53, 58ff). King Mahānāma built a vihāra there 
(Cv.xxxvii.213).</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.289), 
the mountain was also called Udumabarapabbata (or -giri). There seems (See P.L.C., 
s.v. Udumbaragiri) to have lived at Udumbaragiri a fraternity of forest-dwelling 
monks who produced from among their number several scholars of great repute and 
monks of great piety — e.g., Kassapa and Medhankara.</p>
<p>The mountain is identified (Ep. 
Zey.ii.194ff) with the present “Gunners' Quoin” on the right bank of the 
Mahāvaliganga.</p>
