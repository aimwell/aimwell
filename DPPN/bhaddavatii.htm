<p><b>1. Bhaddavatī</b>. A city, the residence of 
  Bhaddavatiyasetthi, father of Sāmāvati. Trade was carried on between Kosambī 
  and Bhaddavatī (DhA.i.187). See also Bhaddavatikā.</p>

</b>A female elephant belonging to King Udena. </p>
<p>She had belonged originally to Candappajjota. She could 
travel fifteen leagues in a day (DhA.i.196). Udena made use of her in his 
elopement with Vāsuladattā (DhA.i.198). At first the king paid her great honour, 
declaring that his life, queen and kingdom were all due to her; her stall was 
smeared with perfumed earth and hung with coloured hangings, a lamp burned 
perfumed oil and a dish of incense was set on one side. She stood on a coloured 
carpet and ate royal food of many flavours. But when she grew old she was 
neglected and became destitute. One day she saw the Buddha entering the city for 
alms, fell at his feet, and complained of the king’s neglect. The Buddha 
reported the matter to the notice of Udena, and all former honours were restored 
to Bhaddavatī. This incident led to the preaching of the Dalhadhamma Jātaka.
