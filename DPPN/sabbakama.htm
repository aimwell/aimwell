<p><b>1. Sabbakāma.</b> One of the chief disciples of 
<a href="sumedha.htm" title="s/sumedha.htm">Sumedha</a> 
Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xii.23.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sabbakāma (v.l. Sabbakāmī).</b> An arahant Thera. He 
was born in a noble family of <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, shortly before the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> death. When he 
came of age he gave away his possessions to his kinsfolk and joined the Order 
under <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>. In the course of his studies, he returned to Vesāli with his 
teacher and visited his family. His former wife, afflicted, thin, in sad array 
and in tears, greeted him and stood by. Seeing her thus, he was overwhelmed with 
love and pity and felt carnal desire. When he realized this, he was filled with 
anguish and hurried to the charnel field, there to meditate on foulness. He 
developed insight and became an arahant. Later, his father in law brought his 
wife to the vihāra, beautifully dressed, and accompanied by a great retinue, 
hoping to make him return, but the Thera convinced them that he had rid himself 
of all such desires. See Thag. vss. 453 8.</p>
<p>Sabbakāma lived on to one hundred and twenty years of age, 
and was consulted by <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa</a>, <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Soreyya Revata</a>, and others, in connection with the 
<a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjiputta</a> heresy. He was, at that time, the oldest Thera in the world. He sat 
on the committee appointed to examine the points in dispute and decided against 
the Vajjaputtakas, giving his reasons point by point. For details see 
Vin.ii.303ff.; also Dpv.iv.49; v. 22; Mhv.iv.48, 576; Sp.i.34.</p>
<p>The Theragāthā Commentary adds (ThagA.i.467) that, before 
his death, Sabbakāmā requested the Brahmā Tissa (afterwards 
<a href="moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm" title="me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm">Moggaliputta Tissa</a>) 
to see that the heresies, which were to arise in the time of
<a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a>, were put 
down. Sabbakāma’s resolve to dispel heresy was made in the time of 
<a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara 
Buddha</a>. Ibid., 465f.</p>
