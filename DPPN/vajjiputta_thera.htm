<p><b>1. Vajjiputta Thera.</b> He belonged to the family of a 
minister of Vesāli, and, seeing the majesty of the Buddha who visited the city, 
he joined the Order and lived in a wood near by. A festival took place in 
Vesāli, with much singing and dancing and gaiety. This distracted Vajjiputta, 
and he expressed his disgust in a verse spoken in scorn of the forest life. A 
woodland sprite heard him and upbraided him, saying, “Though you spurn life in 
the forest, the wise, desiring solitude, think much of it,” and she then uttered 
a verse praising it. This verse, which the monk afterwards repeated, is included 
in Thag.vs.62. </p>
<p>Urged on by the sprite’s words, Vajjiputta developed 
insight and became an arahant.</p>
<p>Ninety one kappas ago he had been a householder and had 
paid homage to Vipassī Buddha, with pollen from nāga flowers. Forty five kappas 
ago he was a king, named Renu. ThagA.i.142f. Vajjiputta’s story is given very 
briefly in S.i.201f.</p>
<p>Vajjiputta’s story is also given in the Dhammapada 
Commentary. There he is called a rājā, and is said to have renounced his kingdom 
when his turn came to rule. On the day of the festival, on the full moon day of 
Kattika, he was filled with discontent. After his conversation with the woodland 
sprite, he sought the Buddha, who preached to him. He attained arahantship at 
the end of the Buddha’s sermon. DhA.iii.460f.; see also SA.i.228, where also he 
is called rājā. There may be some confusion between Vajjiputta (1) and (2).</p>
<p>He is evidently to be identified with Renupūjaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.146.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vajjiputta Thera.</b> He belonged to a Licchavi 
rājā’s family, and while still young, and learning various arts, such as 
training elephants, he was filled with the desire for renunciation. One day he 
went to a vihāra where the Buddha was preaching, entered the Order, and not long 
after became an arahant.</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, when the chief Elders were 
living in various places prior to their agreed meeting for the recital of the 
Dhamma, he saw Ānanda, still a learner (sekha), teaching the Doctrine to a large 
assembly. Wishing to urge him to higher attainment, Vajjiputta uttered a verse, 
and this verse was among those which led to Ānanda’s attainment of arahantship. 
The verse is found in Thag.vs.119. In S.i.199 the verse is attributed to a 
forest deva who wished to agitate Ānanda. In Rockhill (op. cit., 155f.), 
Vajjiputta was Ānanda’s attendant at the time and preached to the people while 
Ānanda meditated.</p>
<p>Ninety four kappas ago, Vajjiputta had seen a Pacceka 
Buddha begging for alms and had given him plantain fruits. ThagA.i.236f.</p>
