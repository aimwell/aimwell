<p>Brahmadatta, king of Benares, once 
started off during the rainy season to quell a border rising. He stopped on the 
way, while his men steamed peas and put them into troughs for the horses to eat. 
A monkey came down from a tree hard by, filled his mouth and hands with peas, 
went back to his tree and started eating. One pea fell down, and he, letting all 
the other peas fall, clambered down to seek for the lost one. The Bodhisatta, 
who was the king’s counsellor, pointed out to the king how fools of little wit 
spend a pound to win a penny. On hearing this, the king went back to Benares.</p>
<p>The story was told to Pasenadi, who was 
going on a similar expedition during the rains, and on the way visited the 
Buddha at Jetavana. The king in the story is identified with Ānanda. J.ii.74ff</p>
