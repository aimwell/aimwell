<h4>1. Niggundipupphiya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Ninety one kappas ago he was the monastery 
attendant (ārāmika) of Vipassī Buddha, and once gave a niggundi flower to the 
Buddha. Thirty five kappas ago he was king, under the name of Mahāpatāpa 
(Ap.i.205). He is probably identical with Vīra Thera. ThagA.i.50f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Niggundipupphiya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. In the past he had been an inhabitant of the 
deva world and listened to the preaching of a disciple of Padumuttara Buddha, 
called Sumana. He then offered a niggundi flower on the seat of the Buddha. In 
this life he entered the Order at the age of seven, and after listening to a 
sermon by Ānanda became an arahant. He was sixteen times king, under the names 
of Abbuda and Nirabudda. Ap.i.262f.</p>
