<p>He was born at <a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, his father bearing 
the same name as himself. (He was probably chief of Jambugāma). He joined the 
Order and dwelt in the <a href="anjana_vana.htm" title="ay/anjana_vana.htm">Añjanavana</a> in 
<a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>. One day, in order to test him, his 
father sent him a verse, and he, realising his imperfections, became an arahant 
(Thag.28; ThagA.i.86f).</p>
<p>In the time of Vessabhū Buddha he threw 
three kimsuka-flowers into the air as offering to the Buddha.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Kimsukapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.435; but see s.v. Somamitta.</p>
