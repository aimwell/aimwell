  <h2>Matakabhatta Jātaka (No. 18)</h2>
  </li>

<p>Once a brahmin, well versed in the Vedas, wished to slay a 
goat at the Feast of the Dead (Matakabhatta), and sent his pupils to bathe the 
goat in the river. After the bath, the goat remembered its past lives and knew 
that after its death that day it would be free from misery. So it laughed for 
joy. But it saw also that the brahmin, through slaying it, would suffer great 
misery, and this thought made it weep. On being questioned as to the reason for 
its laughing and its weeping, it said the answer would be given before the 
brahmin. When the brahmin heard the goat’s story, he resolved not to kill him; 
but that same day, while the goat was browsing near a rock, the rock was struck 
by lightning and a large splinter cut off the goat’s head. 
The Bodhisatta, who was a tree sprite, saw all this and preached the Law to the 
assembled multitude.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a question by the monks 
as to whether there was any good at all in offering sacrifices as Feasts for the 
Dead, which the people of Sāvatthi were in the habit of doing. J.i.166ff.</p>
