  <h2>Anāthapindikovāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Addressed by Sāriputta to Anāthapindika 
when he lay on his deathbed. It was an exhortation to him not to cling to 
mundane things. It is said that at the end of the sermon the banker wept aloud, 
never before having heard such a homily. Soon after, he died and was born as a 
deva, in which form he came to Jetavana and paid homage to the Buddha 
(M.iii.258-63).</p>
<p>In this sutta Sāriputta says that such 
sermons were not vouchsafed to the white-robed laity but reserved for the 
duly-ordained (M.iii.261), a statement sometimes quoted as evidence of an 
esoteric doctrine in Buddhism. </p>
<p>Anāthapindika makes a request that such 
suttas should also be preached to laymen because there are young men whose eyes 
are but slightly dimmed.</p>
