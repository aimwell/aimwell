  <h2>Mahātanhāsankhaya Sutta</h2>
  </li>

<p>Sāti Thera, a fisherman’s son, went about saying that, 
according to the Buddha’s doctrine, one’s consciousness runs on and continues 
without break of identity. Hearing this several monks protested, but failed to 
convince him of his error. Sāti was therefore brought before the Buddha and 
acknowledged that he had spread such a view. The Buddha explains that he had 
always taught that consciousness arises only by causation and that, without 
assignable condition, consciousness does not come about. </p>
<p>There are four substances (āhārā), which either maintain 
existing organisms or help those yet to be: </p>
<ul>
  <li>material substance, </li>
  <li>contact, </li>
  <li>cogitation, and </li>
  <li>perception. </li>
</ul>
<p>The derivation and birth of all four substances is craving
-&nbsp; craving arises from feeling and so on. Three 
things must combine for a conception to take place: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the coitus of the parents, </li>
  <li>the menstruation, at the time, of the mother, 
  </li>
  <li>and the presence of a being awaiting rebirth (gandhabba).
