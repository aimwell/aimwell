<p>King of Benares in the time of Kassapa 
Buddha. His story is related in the Mahā-Kanha Jātaka (J.iv.181ff). He is 
mentioned in a list of kings who, although they gave great gifts, could not get 
beyond the domain of sense (J.vi.99). He is, however, elsewhere (J.vi.251) 
mentioned as having been born in Sakka’s heaven as a result of waiting 
diligently on brahmins and recluses.</p>
