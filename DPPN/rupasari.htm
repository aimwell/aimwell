<p>Mother of <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, who was called after her, his personal name being 
Upatissa. (SNA.i.326; DhA.i.73, etc.; in Sanskrit texts (e.g., Dvy.395) 
Sāriputta is called Sāradvatīputra). </p>
<p>Her husband was the brahmim <a href="vanganta.htm" title="va/vanganta.htm">Vanganta</a> (DhA.ii.84), and she became the mother 
of seven children, all of whom became arahants — <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, 
<a href="upasena.htm" title="u/upasena.htm">Upasena</a>, <a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Mahācunda</a>, 
<a href="revata.htm#Khadiravaniya" title="r/revata.htm#Khadiravaniya">Revata Khadiravaniya</a>, 
<a href="caalaa.htm" title="c/caalaa.htm">Cālā</a>, <a href="upacaalaa.htm" title="u/upacaalaa.htm">Upacālā</a> and 
<a href="sisupacala_theri.htm" title="s/sisupacala_theri.htm">Sisūpacālā</a> (DhA.ii.188; SA.iii.172). </p>
<p>Both she and her husband were unbelievers, and she was very sad when, one 
after another, her children, giving up wealth worth eighty crores, joined the 
Order. She wished to keep at least the youngest of the boys, Revata, for 
herself, and had him married at the age of seven, but her plot miscarried (See 
Revata). This embittered her against the monks, and, though she gave them alms 
when they came to the house, she blamed them for having enticed her children 
away. </p>
<p>Once when Sāriputta visited her with five hundred monks, among whom was 
<a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula</a>, she invited them in and gave them food, but did not fail to abuse her 
son, calling him “eater of leavings” (ucchitthakhādaka) (DhA.iv.164f). She 
outlived Sāriputta, who visited her just before his death, at 
<a href="nala.htm" title="n/nala.htm">Nālakagāma</a>, in the 
house where he was born. There she provided lodging for him and his five hundred 
companions. Sāriputta fell ill of a violent attack of dysentery on the night of 
his arrival, and she saw various gods, including even 
<a href="brahmaloka.htm" title="b/brahmaloka.htm">Mahā Brahmā</a>, come to wait 
on him. Learning their identity from <a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Mahā Cunda</a>, she was amazed and went to see 
Sāriputta to have Mahā Cunda’s words confirmed. Sāriputta told her how Mahā 
Brahmā was a follower of the Buddha and talked to her about the marvellous 
virtues of his teacher. At the end of his talk, she became a 
Sotāpanna. 
Sāriputta died the next day at dawn, and she made elaborate arrangements for his 
cremation (SA.iii.172ff.; for details see Sāriputta).</p>
<p>She seems to have also been called <b>Surūpasārī</b>. E.g., ThigA.162.</p>
