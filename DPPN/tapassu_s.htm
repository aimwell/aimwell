  <h2>Tapassu (Tapussa) Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The householder Tapassu visits Ānanda at 
Uruvelakappa, and expresses surprise that young men in the fullness of life can 
renounce the pleasures of household life and enter the Order. Ānanda takes 
Tapassu to the Buddha, who is having his siesta at the foot of a tree in the 
Mahāvana, and repeats Tapassu’s remark. The Buddha tells Ānanda how he himself 
had attained to Buddhahood by passing through the nine successive stages, the 
anupubbavihārā. These nine stages consist of the four jhānas, the four āyatanas 
(ākāsānañcāyatana, etc.), and, as the crowning stage, the saññāvedayitanirodha 
(A.iv.438ff).</p>
<p>The Tapassu mentioned is evidently 
identical with the brother of Bhalluka mentioned above. </p>
<p>The Commentary (AA.ii.814) on this 
passage makes no attempt to distinguish him from any other.</p>
