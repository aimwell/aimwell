  <h2>Sumanā-rājakumārī Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Sumanā, sister of Pasenadi, visits the Buddha at Jetavana 
with five hundred companions in five hundred chariots and asks him whether, in 
the case of two disciples, alike in faith, virtue and insight, the one being an 
almsgiver and the other not, there be any distinction. The Buddha replies that 
whether they be born in the deva world or in the world of men, the giver would 
be superior in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power. There would still 
be a difference between them, even when, in later life, they both enter the 
Order, but the difference would cease to exist on their becoming arahants 
(A.iii.32f).</p>
<p>The Commentary adds (AA.ii.595f ) that Sumanā’s questions 
were the result of a conversation between two babies born in the house of the 
King of Kosala, one as the king’s son, the other as the son of one of the 
attendant women. The children were laid side by side on two beds, the prince’s 
bed being higher and better. They had both been monks in their previous life; 
the prince was a sārānīyadhammapūraka, the other a bhattaggapūraka. The prince 
saw his past life, and, realizing that the other had not taken his advice and 
had, therefore, suffered eclipse, addressed him as he lay on the next bed. 
Sumanā heard their talk, but spoke no word of it to anyone, in case the children 
should be thought to be possessed of evil spirits.</p>
