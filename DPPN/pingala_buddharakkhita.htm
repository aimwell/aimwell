</ul>
<p>A monk of Ceylon, incumbent of the Ambariya-vihāra. The 
upāsaka of Uttara (or Antara )vaddhamānaka took the precepts from him and was 
soon after seized by a snake. The upāsaka made up his mind not to break the 
precepts, and the snake set him free (MA.i.165; SA.ii.113; DhSA.103, etc.). 
Pingala Buddharakkhita’s monastery was near Uttaragāma (Uttaravaddhamāna?) and 
there were one hundred houses in the village, all of which he visited, and there 
was not one single house at the door of which he had not developed samāpatti. 
MA.ii.978.</p>
