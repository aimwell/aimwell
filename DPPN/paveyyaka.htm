  <h2>Pāveyyakā</h2>

<p>The name given to the inhabitants of Pāvā — 
e.g., Pāveyyakā Mallā (E.g., D.ii.165). </p>
<p>Pāvā was evidently a centre of Buddhist activity even 
during the lifetime of the Buddha, and mention is made of Pāveyyaka monks in the 
Vinaya (E.g., Vin.i.253). During the time of the Vajjiputta heresy, it was the 
Pāveyyakā who upheld the true doctrine, their leaders being Revata, Sambhūta 
Sānavāsī, Yasa Kākandakaputta and Sumana (Vin.ii.301ff.; Mhv.iv.17ff). In this 
connection the Pāveyyakā are also described as “Pacchimikā” in opposition to the 
Vajjiputtakas who are called “Pācīnakā.” </p>
<p>It is explained (E.g., MT.166) that the Pāveyyakā were 
called “Pacchimikā” because they lived to the west. West of Kosala, according to 
Buddhaghosa, on Mahā Vagga (vii.1.).</p>
<p>The Burmese MSS. seem to spell Pāveyyakā as Pātheyvakā.</p>
