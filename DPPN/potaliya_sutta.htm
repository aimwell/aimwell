<h4>1. Potaliya Sutta</h4>
<p>A discussion between the householder Potaliya and the 
Buddha as to what constitutes true retirement from household life. The Buddha 
shows, by means of various similes, that the pleasures; of the senses are 
unsatisfying and dangerous, and should be avoided. Such renunciation brings 
higher knowledge. M.i.359 ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Potaliya Sutta</h4>
<p>The Buddha tells the Paribbājaka Potaliya, who visits him, 
of four kinds of persons found in the world: those who praise and dispraise 
rightly and seasonably, and those who praise and dispraise wrongly and 
unseasonably. A.ii.100ff.</p>
