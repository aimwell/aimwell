  <h2>Kurundī-Atthakathā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the great collections of 
commentaries on the Tipitaka used by Buddhaghosa in the compilation of his 
works. Tradition says (See, e.g., Saddhamma-Sangaha, p.55) 
that it was written in Sinhalese, and was so called because it was compiled in 
the Kurundavelu-Vihāra in Ceylon. </p>
<p>It seems to have been chiefly concerned 
with Vinaya rules, for we find frequent references to it; particularly in the 
Samantapāsādikā. E.g., Sp.i.281; ii.319; iii.537, 544, 545, 573, 583, 597, 616, 
620, 626, 627, 660, 664, 668, 688, 722, 726; iv.745, 
758, 778, 783, 789, 813, 818, 861, 920, etc.</p>
<p>It is also called Kurundī-gandha 
(Gv.59). In many cases its explanations appear to have been different from those 
of other commentaries.</p>
