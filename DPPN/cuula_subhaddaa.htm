<p>Daughter of Anāthapindika. At the 
insistent request of his friend Uggasetthi, and after consultation with the 
Buddha, Anāthapindika agreed to give her in marriage to Ugga’s son. (According 
to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.482ff), the setthi’s name was Kālaka and his 
city was not Ugga, but Sāketa). But he was an unbeliever, and when Niganthas 
came to his house on invitation, Subhaddā refused to do obeisance to them. For 
this she was ordered out of the house by her father-in-law; but she convinced 
her mother-in-law that the reasons for her behaviour were sound, and at the 
suggestion of the latter she prepared a meal and invited to it the Buddha and 
the congregation of monks, by throwing into the air from the top storey of the 
house eight handfuls of jasmine. The Buddha divined her thoughts and arrived 
with five hundred arahants. After the meal the Buddha preached the Doctrine and 
Ugga and his family were converted. As a mark of favour towards Subhaddā the 
Buddha requested Anuruddha to stay behind at Ugganagara. (DhA.iii.465ff; the 
story is also given in AA.ii.482ff, but with several variations in detail. There 
seems to be a comparison between the stories of Mahāsubhaddā and Cūlasubhaddā. 
See also AA.i.146 and Vsm.390). </p>
<p>Cūlasubhaddā, while still in her 
father’s house, had become a Sotāpanna, and with her sisters, Mahāsubhaddā and 
Sumanā, she had been entrusted with the distribution of food to the monks. 
DhA.i.128; J.i.93; ApA.i.81; see also Mil.383, 387.</p>
