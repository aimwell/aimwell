<p>1. Uttaramātā.-Mother of Uttara, who was 
a son of Udena’s minister. (See Uttara 7.) She was miserly, and when her son 
gave alms she abused him, and spoke disparagingly of the holy men who accepted 
his gifts. On one occasion, however, she approved of a gift of a tuft of 
peacock’s feathers at the festival of dedication of a vihāra. After death she 
was born as a peta. Because of her approval of the gift of peacock’s feathers 
she had lovely hair, but when she stepped into the river to drink water, all the 
water turned into blood. (She had told her son that his gifts would turn into 
blood in his nest birth). For fifty-five years she wandered, famished and 
thirsty, till one day, seeing the Elder Kankhā-Revata spending the day on the 
banks of the Ganges, she approached him, covering her nudity with her hair, and 
begged him for a drink. The Elder, having learnt from her her story, gave food 
and drink and clothes to the monks on her behalf and she obtained release from 
her suffering and enjoyed great bliss (Pv.28f; PvA.140ff).</p>
<p>According to the Visuddhi-Magga 
(ii.382), Uttaramātā was able to go through the sky because of the psychic power 
inborn in her as a result of Kamma. This probably refers to another woman. (See 
below 2.)</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Uttaramātā.-A Yakkhinī, mother of 
Punabbasu and Uttarā. Once as she passed Jetavana at sunset looking for food, 
with her daughter on her hip and holding her son by his finger, she saw the 
assembly, intently listening to the Buddha’s sermon. She, too, hoping to get 
some benefit, listened quietly and with great earnestness, hushing her children 
to quietness. The Buddha preached in such a manner that both she and her son 
could understand, and at the end of the sermon they both became Sotāpannā. She 
immediately got rid of her sad Yakkha-state and obtained heavenly bliss, and 
took up her residence in a tree near the Buddha’s Fragrant Chamber.</p>
<p>Little Uttarā was too young to realise 
the Truth. S.i.210; SA.i.238-40; DA.ii.500f.</p>
