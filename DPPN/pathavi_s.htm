<h4>1. Pathavī Sutta</h4>
<p>Seven small balls of clay, as big as jujube kernels, are 
infinitely smaller than the earth. So with the Ariyan disciple — when he has won 
understanding, the dukkha that remains is infinitely smaller than that which he 
has destroyed. S.ii.135f.; repeated at S.v.462f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pathavī Sutta</h4>
<p>The same as the above. S.ii.136.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Pathavī Sutta</h4>
<p>Incalculable is samsāra. The number of parents a man has 
had would be greater than the number of balls, each the size of a kola (jujube) 
kernel, that could be made of the clay of the earth. S.ii.179.</p>
