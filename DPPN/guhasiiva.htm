<p>King of Kālinga. At first he did not pay 
honour to the Tooth-relic of the Buddha which was in his capital, but later, 
having seen a miracle, he became a Buddhist and paid the relic all homage.

through his daughter Hemamālā and her husband Dantakumāra. The whole story is 
given in the Dāthāvamsa (chap.iv.ff).</p>
