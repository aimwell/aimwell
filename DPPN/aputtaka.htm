<p>A wealthy burgess of Sāvatthi who died 
intestate. In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.89-91) we find Pasenadi, King of Kosala, 
visiting the Buddha at noonday and telling him that he had just finished having 
the banker’s wealth removed to the royal coffers, “eight millions of gold to say 
nothing of silver.” And yet Aputtaka ate nothing except sour husk-gruel left 
over from the previous day and wore only hempen garments.</p>
<p>In the next Sutta of the same Nikāya 
(S.i.91-3) the Buddha is reported as revealing the banker’s past. In a former 
birth he had given alms to a Pacceka Buddha, Tagarasikhī, but later he repented 
and wished that he had given the food to slaves and workmen.</p>
<p>He had, in the same birth, slain the 
only son of his brother for the sake of his fortune.</p>
<p>As a result of the alms he was born 
seven times in the deva-worlds and seven times as a rich man of Sāvatthi. His 
repentance made him inclined to deny himself enjoyment of sense-desires. Owing 
to the murder of his nephew in his previous birth, he was childless in this, and 
he died intestate. After this life he was born in Mahāroruva purgatory. 
</p>
<p>The Mayhaka Jātaka (J.iii.299f.), 
contains the whole story of the banker’s past and present, giving many graphic 
details not found in the Samyutta account, but it does not mention the seven 
births in heaven or in Sāvatthi. It adds that the king’s men took seven days and 
nights to remove the treasure. Aputtaka is there referred to not as Aputtaka but 
as Āgantuka (Strange). See also DhA.iv.76-80.</p>
