  <h2>Jāliya</h2>

<p>A paribbājaka who, with his friend 
Mandissa, visited the Buddha at the Ghositārāma (D.i.159). The Buddha preached 
to them the Jāliya Sutta (q.v.). According to the Pātika Sutta, when Jāliya 
heard that Pātika could not come to hold a discussion with the Buddha at Vesāli, 
he went to the Tindukkhāna-paribbājakārāma and tried to get Pātikaputta to come. 
But the latter was unable to come, being fixed in his seat. Jāliya thereupon 
spoke insultingly to him, calling him boaster, etc. (D.iii.22ff).</p>
<p>Jāliya is described as 
dārupattakantevāsī, because, says the Commentary (DA.i.319), his teacher used to 
beg for alms with a wooden bowl.</p>
