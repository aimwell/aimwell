<p>An upﾄ《aka of Icchﾄ］angala. </p>
<p>He was a devoted disciple of the Buddha 
and had been in the habit of visiting him often (UdA.115). </p>
<p>Once he visited the Buddha at Jetavana 
after a long interval, and on being asked why he had been absent so long, he 
replied that he had been kept busy by various duties. Thereupon the Buddha sang 
the joy of the life free from ties. Ud., p.13.</p>
