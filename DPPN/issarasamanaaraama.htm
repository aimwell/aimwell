<p>One of the monasteries at Anurādhapura. 
It was built by Devānampiyatissa on the spot where the prince Arittha dwelt with 
his five hundred followers after having received their ordination from Mahinda 
(Mhv.xx.14; xix.66). The building of this monastery was the seventh of the great 
tasks performed by Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xx.20).</p>
<p>One of the eight saplings from the Bodhi-tree 
at Anurādhapura was planted at Issarasamanārāma (Mhv.xix.61; Mbv.162).</p>
<p>Candamukha Siva built a tank near 
Manikāragāmaka and gave it for the use of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxv.47), while 
Vasabha built in the monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxv.87) and Vohāraka Tissa 
constructed a wall round it (Mhv.xxxvi.36). Kassapa I. restored the buildings 
and enlarged the grounds. He also bought villages which he presented to the 
monastery for its maintenance. He had two daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā, and 
he gave their names and his own to the vihāra. When the king wished to hand over 
the vihāra to the Theravāda monks they refused to accept it, fearing the 
reproach of the people that it was the work of a parricide. Then the king 
dedicated it to the image of the Buddha and the monks accepted it saying that it 
belonged to their Master (Cv.xxxix.10-14; see also below).</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (pp. 407 
and 652), the vihāra was also called Kassapagiri, probably after its restoration 
by Kassapa I., mentioned above.' See also Kassapagiri. See also Cv. Trs.i.43, 
n.7, and Ep. Zeyl. i.31ff., where the vihāra is called “Isuramenu-.Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri” 
in an inscription of Mahinda IV.</p>
<p>It had originally been called 
Issarasamana because of its association with the five hundred noblemen (issaradārakā) 
who joined the Order with Arittha (MT.416). The Tīkā adds (607) that Sāliya, son 
of Dutthagāmani, enlarged the vihāra out of the tribute brought to him by the 
men of his tributary villages to the south of Anurādhapura. He used to observe 
the uposatha on fast days at the vihāra and spend the day in the Mahindaguhā 
there.</p>
<p>In the Samantapāsādikā (i.100) the 
vihāra is called Issaranimmāna.</p>
