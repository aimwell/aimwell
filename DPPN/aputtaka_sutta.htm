<p>1. Aputtaka Sutta.-Contains the earlier 
part of the story of Aputtaka as given above, and the moral to be drawn 
therefrom: namely, that the mean man, who acquires wealth, pleases neither 
himself nor others, but is like a lake of delicious waters lying in a savage 
region. On the other hand, the rich man who is generous is like a lake near a 
village. S.i.89-91.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Aputtaka Sutta.-Contains an account 
of Aputtakaâ€™s past, as related above; the wealth that a man stores here has to 
be left behind for others; hence let him make a good store for life elsewhere by 
using this wealth well. S.i.91-3.</p>
