<p>1. Jāli.-Son of Vessantara and Maddī, 
and brother of Kanhajinā. He and his sister were given to Jūjaka as slaves, but 
were later rescued by the intervention of Sakka. Jāli led the army which brought 
Vessantara back from his hermitage. He is identified with Rāhula (J.vi.487ff; 
cp.i.9). See the Vessantara Jātaka.</p>
<p>Jāli is probably also the king of the 
same name given in a list of Okkāka’s descendants, and stated to have succeeded 
Vessantara (E.g., Mhv.ii.13; Dpv.iii.42).</p>
<p>The gift of Jāli as a slave is 
considered one of the greatest sacrifices made by the Bodhisatta. J.i.77; 
AA.i.64; DhA.i.406; Mil.275, 282, etc.</p>
<p>2. Jāli.-The name of two Pacceka 
Buddhas, occurring in a nominal list. M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.</p>
