<p>The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares, and, one day, 
while dallying near a lake in his park, he noticed that fishes and tortoises 
flocked to him. He learnt, on enquiry, that these animals were attracted by his 
music, and ordered that they should be fed regularly. On finding that some of 
them failed to appear, he made arrangements for a drum to be sounded at the 
feeding time. Later, finding that a crocodile came and ate some of the fish, the 
king ordered him to be harpooned. The crocodile escaped capture, but died soon 
after.</p>
<p>The story was related to a backsliding monk. Desire always 
leads to suffering, said the Buddha; it was desire that caused the death of the 
crocodile. J.ii.227f.</p>
