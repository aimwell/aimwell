<p>A Damila stronghold, subdued by 
  Dutthagāmani after a four months' siege.  </p>
<p>Its commander was called Mahela 
  (Mhv.xxv.48f).  </p>
<p>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (479f.) explains that the city lay off the 
  road leading from Vijitapura to Anurādhapura. It was the king’s elephant, 
  Kandula, who led the way thither.<span lang="en-us"> 
  The city erected on the spot where the elephant turned off 
  the main road was called Nivattagirinagara.</p>
