<p><b>1. Abhibhū.</b>-Chief disciple of 
Sikhī Buddha (D.ii.9; J.i.41; Bu.xxi.20). In the Arunavatī Sutta it is said that 
he went with Sikhī to a Brahma-world and, at the Buddha’s request, preached a 
sermon to the accompaniment of great magical powers. He proved that by using 
just such speech as if he were preaching to a gathering of monks, he could, 
standing in the Brahma-world, make his voice heard by its thousand realms 
(S.i.154f). The verses spoken on this occasion are, in the Theragāthā, ascribed 
to Abhibhūta (v.1147-8).</p>
<p>In the Anguttara Nikāya (i.226f.; 
AA.i.436f ) we find Ānanda asking the Buddha how far Abhibhū’s powers bore 
relation to those of a Buddha, and the Buddha replying that Abhibhū was a mere 
disciple, and proceeding to describe the immeasurable powers of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>Abhibhū was a brahmin because we find 
him so addressed in the Arunavatī Sutta referred to above, but in the 
Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.202) he is spoken of as a rājaputta.</p>
<p>In the Patisambhidhāmagga Commentary 
(488f ) his story is given as an example of vikubbana-iddhi whereby a person 
could make himself seen in many places at the same time. We are told that he 
developed nīlakasina, to attract to himself the attention of the world systems.</p>
<p>The Thera Adhopupphiya had been a hermit 
in Himavā during the time of Sikhī Buddha and had offered flowers to Abhibhū. 
Ap.i.128-9.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Abhibhū.</b>-A class of devas 
belonging to the Arūpa-plane (M.i.1). They live in the same plane as the 
Vehapphalā. In the Mūlapariyāya Sutta the word is used to denote all the 
Asaññasattādevā. Buddhaghosa explains the word by saying abhibhavī ti Abhibhū; 
kim abhibhavī ti ? cattāro khandhe, arūpino. They are beautiful and long-lived, 
and are therefore considered to be eternal and identical with Brahmā (MA.i.30). 
In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.329) the Buddha claims to be Abhibhū (=the 
conqueror).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Abhibhū.</b>-The name of a 
Bodhisatta who obtained vivarana under Gotama. He will become the sixth Buddha 
after Gotama. Anāgata Vamsa, p.37.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Abhibhū Sutta.</b>-On the 
immeasurableness of a Buddha’s powers. A.i.226f.; also called the Sīhanada Sutta 
in the Commentary.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Abhibhū Sutta</b>.-On the eight 
stages or stations of mastery over the senses (abhibhāyaphanāni) (A.iv.305f).</p>
