<p>A monastic building, once the residence of a monk named 
Mahādhammakathī. Kassapa II. found the buildings dilapidated, and, during their 
restoration, he persuaded the Elder to live in a large pāsāda attached to the 
Maricavatti vihara.</p>
<p>The Elder was proficient in the Abhidhamma, and the king 
caused the Abhidhamma and the Commentaries to be recited by him. The village of 
Mahānitthula was given to him for his maintenance (Cv.xliv.149ff.; xlv.2). 
Nāgasālā was also the residence of Dāthāsiva (Ibid.xlvi.6). </p>
<p>A parivena, called the Nāgasāla parivena, was built by 
Aggabodhi, ruler of Malaya and minister to the king, in the reign of Sena III., 
who gave a village for its maintenance (Ibid.,liii.36).</p>
