  <h2>Hatthaka, called Alavaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An eminent lay disciple of the Buddha declared foremost 
among those who gather a following by means of the four bases of sympathy (catūhi 
vatthūhi parisam sanganhantānam) (A.i.26). He was the son of the, king of Alavī 
(hence his name Alavaka), and the Buddha saved him from being eaten by the 
<a href="aalavaka.htm" title="aa/aalavaka.htm">Yakkha Alavaka</a>. He was given the name of Hatthaka because he was handed 
to the Buddha by the Yakkha, after the latter’s conversion, and by the Buddha to 
the king’s messengers. He was thus “handed” from one to another (hatthato 
hattham gatattā) (AA.i.212; SNA.i.240).</p>
<p>When he grew up Hatthaka heard the Buddha preach, and, in 
due course, became an Anāgāmī. He was always accompanied by five hundred lay 
disciples, and was one of seven laymen who had such a following (SA.iii.223). 
The books record several conversations between the Buddha and Hatthaka. He once 
saw the Buddha at Gomagga in Simsapavana, near Alavi, and asked him if he were 
one of those who lived happily. The Buddha said he was always happy in any 
circumstances (A.i.136f). On another occasion the Buddha asked Hatthaka how he 
could command the allegiance of such a large company. “By the four bases of 
sympathy,” he answered,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>by giving gifts, </li>
  <li>by kindly words,  </li>
  <li>by kindly deeds,  </li>
  <li>by equality of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>And when Hatthaka had gone, the Buddha praised him for 
his eminence, in that he possessed eight marvellous qualities:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>faith,  </li>
  <li>virtue, 
 
</li>
  <li>conscientiousness,  </li>
  <li>fear of blame,  </li>
  <li>ability to listen well,  </li>
  <li>charity,  </li>
  <li>wisdom, 
 
</li>
  <li>modesty. (A.iv.218f; his modesty is especially mentioned elsewhere also e.g., at 
A.iv.216).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Together with <a href="citta.htm" title="c/citta.htm">Citta-gahapati</a>, Hatthaka is often held up as an example 
to be copied by others. (E.g., at S.ii.235; A.i.88; ii.164; iii.451, etc.).</p>
<p>After death, Hatthaka was born in 
<a href="avihaa.htm" title="ay/avihaa.htm">Avihā</a>, there to pass away entirely. From there he 
once visited the Buddha and tried to stand in his presence, but collapsed and 
could not remain upright. The Buddha then asked him to create a gross body form, 
and when he did this he was able to stand. He told the Buddha that he was 
constantly surrounded by devas wishing to learn the Dhamma from him, and 
confessed that he had died regretting three things — </p>
<ul>
  <li>of not having seen enough of the Buddha, </li>
  <li>of not heard enough of the Dhamma, </li>
  <li>of not served enough the Sangha (A.i.278f).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Buddhavamsa (Bu.xxvi.19), Citta and Hatthakālavaka 
are mentioned as the chief lay patrons (aggupatthākā) of Gotama Buddha.</p>
