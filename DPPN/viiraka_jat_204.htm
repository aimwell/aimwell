<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a marsh crow, named Vīraka, 
and lived near a pool. There was a drought in Kāsi, and a crow, named Savitthaka, 
finding no food, went with his wife to where Vīraka lived, and, becoming his 
servant, ate of the fishes which Vīraka caught in the pool. Later, Savitthaka, 
in spite of Vīraka’s warning, tried to catch fish himself and was drowned.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta’s attempt to 
imitate the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with the crow Savitthaka. J.ii.148 
L; quoted at DhA.i.122.</p>
