<p>A brahmin and his wife wished to give alms to four 
brahmins; the brahmin went to the monastery to fetch them. With him returned 
four arahant sāmaneras: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="sankicca.htm" title="sa/sankicca.htm">Sankicca</a> (Saññkicca)</li>
  <li><a href="pandita.htm" title="pa/pandita.htm">Pandita</a></li>
  <li><a href="sopaka.htm" title="s/sopaka.htm">Sopāka</a></li>
  <li><a href="revata.htm#4" title="r/revata.htm#4">Revata</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The wife was angry at the sight of them and sent the man 
back. He brought, in turn, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, both of whom turned back on 
seeing the novices. Sakka’s throne was heated, as the novices sat hungry, and he 
came in the guise of a brahmin, entered the house, and sat down after 
worshipping the novices. The brahmin and his wife tried to turn him out; but 
failing in this, they fed all their five guests. Each of them made an opening in 
some part of the house, through which he departed. Henceforth the house was 
known as the Pañcacchiddageha. DhA.iv.176ff.</p>
