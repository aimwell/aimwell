  <h2>1. Bījaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The son of <a href="sudinna.htm" title="s/sudinna.htm">Sudinna Kalandakaputta</a> by the wife of his lay 
days. He was conceived after Sudinna had already been ordained. His wife came to 
him during her period and begged him to give her an offspring (bījaka). As the 
rule against unchastity had not then been promulgated, Sudinna yielded to her 
importunities, thus becoming guilty of the first Pārājikā. The son was called 
Bījaka, and so Sudinna came to be called Bījakapitā and the mother Bījakamātā. 
Both Bījaka and his mother later left the world and became arahants. Vin.iii.17 
19; Sp.i.215f.</p>

  <h2>2. Bījaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A slave of <a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a>, present when the ascetic Guna expounded 
his doctrine to King <a href="angati.htm" title="ay/angati.htm">Angati</a>, and it was approved by Alāta. Bījaka also agreed 
that Guna’s teaching accorded with his own experience. He remembered his 
previous life, when he had been born as Bhāvasetthi of Sāketa and had done many 
acts of virtue and piety. But at present he was the son of a poor prostitute 
leading a wretched life. Even so, he always gave half his food to any who might 
desire it, kept the fast, and led, in every way, a virtuous life. But virtue, he 
said, was useless; it bore no fruit. So saying, he wept. When Rujā (q.v.) heard 
this, she said that Bījaka’s sufferings were due to evil actions done in the 
past in earlier lives (J.vi.227, 228, 229, 233, 235). </p>
<p>The scholiast explains (J.vi.228) that in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha, while Bījaka was seeking a lost ox, a monk enquired of him the 
way which he had lost. Bījaka was angry and abused the monk, calling him a 
slave. His birth as Bhāvasetthi was due to some earlier good done by him, but in 
this birth he became a slave. </p>
<p>Bījaka is identified with Moggallāna (J.vi.225).</p>
