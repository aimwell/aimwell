  <h2>Ratanapāsāda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A building in the Abhayagiri vihāra, erected by King Kanitthatissa for 
Mahānāga Thera (Mhv.xxxvi.8; for its identification see Cv.Trs.i.123, n.2). </p>
<p>Mahinda II. evidently rebuilt it at a cost of three hundred thousand 
kahāpanas, and installed in it a Buddha image worth sixty thousand. At the 
dedication festival, the king offered his whole kingdom to the image 
(Cv.xlviii.135f). Mahinda III. gave the revenue from the Getthumba Canal for the 
repairs of the pasāda (Cv.xlix.41). </p>
<p>In the reign of Sena I. the Pānidīyas, who invaded Ceylon, plundered the 
pāsāda and removed the jewels from the eyes of the image (Cv.l.43). Sena II. 
found the image itself removed from its pedestal and taken to Madhurā, and, 
after his victory over the Pānndiyas, he had it restored (Cv.li.22,49). When the 
people rose in rebellion against Udaya III., he took refuge in the Ratanapāsāda 
with his colleagues, but the people surrounded the building and they were forced 
to flee (Cv.liii.17).</p>
