  <h2>Alandanāgarājamahesī</h2>

<p>The name occurs in the Samantapāsādikā 
(iii.680), in a discussion as to what is and what is not, kappiya for the monks. 
Monks should not accept or use a pond or any such thing, unless it has been 
properly gifted to them. </p>
<p>But if the real owners of the pond, 
etc., or their heirs, or, if no heirs exist, the chief of the district, having 
discovered that the pond was being used by monks, were to give it to the monks, 
then the gift becomes kappiya, “as in the case of the bucket of water taken by 
the monk of Cittalapabbata and Alandanāgarājamahesī” — evidently meaning that 
the water was later given to the monk by the mahesī, thereby making it kappiya.</p>
