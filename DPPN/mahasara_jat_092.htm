<h2>Mahāsāra Jātaka (No. 92)</h2>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once minister of Brahmadatta, king of 
Benares. One day the king went with his queens to the park and the latter took 
off their ornaments for bathing. A female monkey, watching her opportunity, 
stole a pearl necklace. On the loss being discovered, the king had every person 
and every place searched. A rustic, seeing the commotion, took to his heels and 
was chased and captured by the guards. When questioned, he confessed to having 
stolen the necklace, thinking that the best way of saving his life, and said he 
had given it to the Treasurer. The Treasurer said he had given it to the 
chaplain, the chaplain to the chief musician, the musician to the courtesan. As 
it was by this time late, the matter was put off till the next day, the alleged 
accomplices being imprisoned. The Bodhisatta, doubting their words, obtained the 
king’s leave to investigate the matter. He had the prisoners watched, and knew, 
from their reported conversations, that they were innocent. He then decided that 
it had been stolen by a monkey, and gave orders that a number of monkeys should 
be captured and turned loose again with strings of beads round their necks, 
wrists, and ankles. The monkey, who had stolen the necklace, on seeing the 
others with their beads, was filled with jealousy and produced the necklace. The 
guard frightened her, and so she dropped it, and the Bodhisatta was greatly 
praised for his wisdom.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Ānanda. Pasenadi’s 
wives wished for someone to preach to them in the palace. Pasenadi went to the 
Buddha and from him heard the praises of Chattapānī. Later, he met him and asked 
him to preach in his harem. But Chattapānī was unwilling, saying that it was the 
prerogative of the monks. Thereupon the king asked the Buddha to appoint 
someone, and the Buddha appointed Ānanda. One day Ānanda found all the women of 
the palace very dejected, and learnt that the jewel of the king’s turban had 
been lost and everyone was most distracted. Ānanda, therefore, went to the king 
and asked that each suspect should be given a wisp of straw on a lump of clay 
and asked to place it somewhere, the idea being that the thief would leave the 
jewel in one of these lumps. The ruse, however, did not succeed, and orders were 
then given that a water pot be set in a retired corner of the courtyard behind a 
screen and that everyone should be asked to wash his hands. When all had washed, 
the pot was emptied and the jewel found inside it.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with the king of the Jātaka. J.i.381 
7.</p>
