<p>A village in Ceylon, which contained a 
vihāra and a thūpa. King Vasabha repaired the thūpa, built an uposatha-house, 
and endowed land for the maintenance of lamps in the house (Mhv.xxxv.85). The 
village is probably identical with that mentioned elsewhere as 
Galamba-titthagāma (Cv.lxxv.7). In that case, it was in Rohana and was the scene 
of a battle in the campaign of Parakkamabāhu I.</p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.i.57; 
VibhA.353) contain references to a group of fifty monks dwelling in 
Galambatittha Vihāra, who took a vow never to address each other until they 
attained arahantship.</p>
<p>See s.v. Kalambatittha.</p>
