<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha there lived a monk who was 
maintained by a rich man of the district. Into the monastery belonging to this 
rich man there came one day an arahant, and the former, liking his appearance, 
asked him to stay in the monastery, promising to look after him. The arahant 
agreed, but the incumbent of the monastery grew jealous and told their patron 
that the arahant was lazy and good for nothing. Some food sent by the patron for 
the arahant the incumbent threw into the embers. The arahant, reading his 
thoughts, left and went elsewhere. The monk was seized with remorse and was 
reborn in hell. In five hundred successive births he was a Yakkha, with never 
enough to eat; during a further five hundred births he was a dog. Then he was 
born, under the name of Mittavindaka, in a poor family 
in Kāsi. Because of him, dire misfortune befell the family, and he was driven 
out. In Benares he became a charity scholar under the Bodhisatta, who was a 
teacher there, but he was so quarrelsome that he was sent away. He married a 
poor woman and had two children. For a while he was a teacher, but the village 
in which he lived earned the king’s displeasure seven times, their houses caught 
fire and the water dried up. Having discovered the cause, the villagers drove 
out Mittavindaka and his family. In a haunted forest the wife and children were 
eaten up by demons.</p>
<p>In his wanderings Mittavindaka came to a coastal village, 
Gambhīra, where he took service in a ship. On the seventh day of the voyage the 
ship suddenly stopped sailing. Lots were cast, and seven times the lot fell on 
Mittavindaka, so they put him on a raft and lowered him overboard. He was cast 
ashore on an island where lived four vimāna petas in palaces of crystal, and he 
enjoyed happiness with them for seven days. From there he went to an island 
where lived eight goddesses in palaces of silver, thence to another where lived 
sixteen in palaces of jewels, thence to another still where lived thirty two in 
palaces of gold. In each he stayed seven days. From the last he went to an 
island of ogres. There he seized an ogress wandering about in the shape of a 
goat, and, when she kicked him, he was hurled into the dry moat of Benares. 
There goatherds were keeping watch for thieves, and when Mittavindaka seized a 
goat, hoping to be kicked back to his original place, he was caught. As he was 
being led away, the Bodhisatta saw and recognized him and persuaded the 
goatherds to allow him to have him as a slave.</p>
