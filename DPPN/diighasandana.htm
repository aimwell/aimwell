<p>A Commander-in-chief of Devānampiyatissa. 
He built a little pāsāda “on eight pillars” for Mahinda, which became known as 
Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena (Mhv.xv.212f; also Cv.xxxviii.16), and is famous as 
the residence of Mahānāma, author of the Mahāvamsa (MT.502). According to the 
Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.289), Dīghasandaka was so called because he wore a long robe (dīghasāttakam 
nivāsesīti Dīghasandako), and the original name of the parivena built by him was 
Cūlapāsāda.</p>
