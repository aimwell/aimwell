  <h2>Māra</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the 
Evil One, the Tempter (the Buddhist counterpart of the Devil or Principle of 
Destruction). The legends concerning Māra are, in the books, very involved and 
defy any attempts at unravelling them. In the latest accounts, mention is made 
of five Māras&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
  <li>Khandha Māra, </li>
  <li>Kilesa Māra, </li>
  <li>Abhisankhāra Māra, </li>
  <li>Maccu Māra and </li>
  <li>Devaputta Māra&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>as shown in the following quotations: pañcannam pi Mārānam 
vijayato jino (ThagA.ii.16); sabbāmittehi khandha-kilesā-bhisankhāramaccudeva-puttasankhāte, 
sabbapaccatthike (ThagA.ii.46); sankhepato vā 
pañcakilesa-khandhābhi-sankhāra-devaputta-maccumāre abhañji, tasmā . . . bhagavā 
ti vuccati (Vsm.211). </p>
<p>Elsewhere, however, Māra is spoken of as one, three, or 
four. Where Māra is one, the reference is generally either to the kilesas or to 
Death. Thus: Mārenāti kilesamārena (ItvA.197); Mārassa visaye ti kilesamārassa 
visaye (ThagA.ii.70); jetvāna maccuno senam vimokkhena anāvaran ti 
lokattayābhibyāpanato diyaddhasahassādi vibhāgato ca vipulattā aññehi avāritum 
patisedhetum asakkuneyyattā ca maccuno, Mārassa, senam vimokkhena ariyamaggena 
jetvā (ItvA.198); Mārāsenā ti ettha satte anatthe niyojento māretīti Māro 
(UdA.325); nihato Māro bodhimūle ti vihato samucchinno kilesamāro 
bodhirukkhamūle (Netti Cty. 235); vasam Mārassa gacchatīti kilesamārassa ca 
sattamārassa (?) ca vasam gacchi (Netti, p. 86); tato sukhmnataram Mārabandhanan 
ti kilesabandhanam pan' etam tato sukhumataram (SA.iii.82); Māro māro ti maranam 
pucchati, māradhammo ti maranadhammo (SA.ii.246).</p>
<p>It is evidently with this same significance that the term 
Māra, in the older books, is applied to the whole of the worldly existence, the 
five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbāna. Thus Māra is 
defined at CNid. (No. 506) as kammābhisankhāravasena patisandhiko kandhamāro 
dhātumāro, āyatanamāro. And again: Māro Māro ti bhante vuccati katamo nu kho 
bhante Māro ti? Rūpam kho, Rādha, Māro, vedanāmāro, saññāmāro, sankhāramāro 
viññānam Māro (S.iii.195); yo kho Rādha Māro tatra chando pahātabbo. Ko ca Rādha 
Māro? Rūpam kho Rādha Māro . . . pe . . . vedanāmāro. Tatra kho Rādha chando 
pahātabbo (S.iii.198); sa upādiyamāno kho bhikku baddho Mārassa, anupadiyamāno 
mutto pāpimāto (S.iii.74); evam sukhumam kho bhikkhave, Vepacittibandhanam; tato 
sukhumataram mārabandhanam; maññamāno kho bhikkhave baddho Mārassa, amaññamāno 
mutto pāpimato (S.iv.202); labhati Māro otāram, labhati Māro ārammanam 
(S.iv.85); santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyarūpā ... pe . . . tañ ce bhikkhu 
abhinandati . . . pe . . . ayam vuccati bhikkhave bhikkhu āvāsagato Mārassa, 
Mārassa vasam, gato (S.iv.91); dhunātha maccuno senam nalāgāram va kuñjaro ti 
paññindriyassa padathānam (Netti, p. 40); rūpe kho Rādha sati Māro vā assa 
māretā vā yo vā pana mīyati. Tasmā he tvam Rādha rūpam māro ti passa māretā ti 
passa mīyatīti passa ... ye nam evam passanti te sammā passanti (S.iii.189); 
Mārasamyogan ti tebhūmakavattam (SNA.ii.506).</p>
<p>The Commentaries also speak of three Māras: bodhipallanke 
tinnam Mārānam matthakam bhinditvā (DA.ii.659); aparājitasanghan ti ajj' eva 
tayo Māre madditvā vijitasangānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim 
abhisambuddho (CNidA. p. 47). In some cases the three Māras are specified: 
yathayidam bhikkhave mārabalan ti yathā idam devaputtamāra maccumāra 
kilesamārānam balam appasaham durabhisambhavam (DA.iii.858); maccuhāyino ti 
maranamaccu kilesamccu devaputtamaccu hāyino, tividham pi tam maccum hitvā 
gāmino ti vuttam hoti (SNA.ii.508; cp. MA.ii.619); na lacchati Māro otāram, Māro 
ti devaputtmāro pi maccumāro pi kilesamāro pi (DA.iii.846); but elsewhere five 
are mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., ariyamaggakkhane kilesamāro abhisahkhāramāro, 
devaputtamāro ca carimaka cittakkhane khandhamāro maccumāro ti pañcavidhamāro 
abhibhūto parājito (UdA.216). Very occasionally four Māras are mentioned: 
catunnam Mārānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisamabuddho (MNid. 
129); indakhīlopamo catubbidhamāraparavādiganehi akampiyatthena (SNA.i.201); 
Mārasenam sasenam abhibhuyyāti kilesasenāya anantasenāya ca sasenam anavasittham, 
catubbidham pi māram abhibhavitvā devaputtamārassā pi hi gunamārane 
sahāyabhāvūpagamanato kilesā senā ti vuccanti (ItvA.136). The last quotation 
seems to indicate that the four Māras are the five Māras less Devaputta Māra.</p>
<p>A few particulars are available about Devaputta Māra: Māro 
ti Vasavattibhūmiyam aññataro dāmarikadevaputto. So hi tam thānam 
atikkamitukāmam janam yam na sakkoti tam māreti, yam na sakkoti tassa pi maranam 
icchati, tenā Māro ti vuccati (SNA.i.44); Māro yeva pana sattasankhātāya pajāya 
adhipatibhāvena idha Pajāpatīti adhippeto. So hi kuhim vasatīti? 
Paranimmittavasavattidevaloke. Tatra hi Vasavattirājā rajjam kāreti. Māro 
ekasmim padese attano parisāya issariyam pavattento rajjapaccante 
dāmarikarājapittto viya vasatī ti vadanti (MA.i.28); so hi Māro opapātiko 
kāmāvacarissaro, kadāci brahmapārisajjānampi kāye adhimuccitum samattho (Jinālankāra 
Tīkā, p.217).</p>
<p>In view of the many studies of Māra by various scholars, 
already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Māra 
in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data. The commonest use of the word was 
evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world 
under the sway of death” (also called Māradheyya — 
e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein. Thence, the kilesas also came to be 
called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to 
hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were 
likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a 
devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head 
of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of 
sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As 
time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with 
the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p>
<p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with 
Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over 
which Death and the kilesas hold sway. Thus: Those who can restrain the mind and 
check its propensities can escape the snares of Māra (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 7). He 
who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under Māra’s sway 
(S.iv.91). He who has attachment is entangled by Māra (S.iii.73). Māra will 
overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle 
and weak (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 8). By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be 
free from Māra (Dhp. vs. 40). The Samyutta (i. 135) records a conversation 
between Māra and Vajirā. She has attained arahantship, and tells Māra: “There is 
no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap 
of sankhāras (suddhasankhārarapuñja).</p>
<p>The later books, especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka 
Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp. MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p. 239f), 
contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha 
by Māra, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his 
Enlightenment. These accounts describe how Māra, the devaputta, seeing the 
Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his 
forces and advanced against him. These forces extended to a distance of twelve 
yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the 
right and to the left. Māra himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, 
Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. His followers assumed 
various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons. At Māra’s 
approach, all the various Devas, Nāgas and others, who were gathered round the 
Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong 
flight. The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the ten 
pārami which he had practiced to perfection.</p>
<p>Māra’s army is described as being tenfold, and each 
division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in 
Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail. Each division was faced by the 
Buddha with one pāramī and was put to flight. Māra’s last weapon was the 
Cakkāvudha (q.v.). But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a 
canopy of flowers. Still undaunted, Māra challenged the Buddha to show that the 
seat on which he sat was his by right. Māra’s followers all shouted their 
evidence that the seat was Māra’s. The Buddha, having no other witness, asked 
the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response. 
Māra and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered 
round the Buddha to celebrate his victory. The sun set on the defeat of Māra. 
This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha’s conquest of Māra, greatly 
elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines 
and temples with all the wealth of riotous color and fanciful imagery that 
gifted artists could command.</p>
<p>That this account of the Buddha’s struggle with Māra is 
literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the 
present day. The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids 
(Article on Buddha in the Ency. Brit.). We are to understand by the attack of 
Māra’s forces, that all the Buddha’s “old temptations came back upon him with 
renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of 
a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within 
itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but 
now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of 
wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again 
with attractive colors. He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun 
set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come 
out even purified from the struggle.” There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, 
with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op. cit., 230), whether we can assume 
that the elaborators of the Māra story were recording “a subjective experience 
under the form of an objective reality,” and did they know or think that this 
was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living 
traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid 
of the rationalists. The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the 
elaboration so dear to the hearts of the Pāli rhapsodists.</p>
<p>The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their 
commentarial works — e.g., in the Uttarādhyayana 
Sūtra (ZDMG. vol. 49 (1915), 321ff )&nbsp;&nbsp; bears no close parallelism to 
the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Māra legend had its origin in 
the Padhāna Sutta (q.v.). There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the 
banks of the Nerañjarā, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to 
abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s 
army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the 
Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; 
the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the 
eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained 
form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of 
others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet 
Māra with his equipage (savāhanam). He shall not make me yield ground. That army 
of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my 
wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have 
practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p>
<p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta (SN. vs. 446f.; cf. 
S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and 
this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us. After Māra had retired 
discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any 
transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow 
attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so 
overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha 
disappeared thence.” This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was 
picked up by Sakka and given to Pañcasikha. Of this part of the sutta, more 
anon.</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal. 490 
(378); cp. A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta (“Dhītaro” 
Sutta) in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha 
after his Enlightenment. Their names are Tanhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are 
evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given 
in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full 
of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit 
defeat.</p>
<p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all 
temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and 
Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his 
nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared 
before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away 
from their chosen path.</p>
<p>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him 
and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he 
himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was 
free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22). On another occasion Māra 
entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. 
(S.i.67; cp. DhA.iv.141, where Māra asks the Buddha about the further shore. In 
the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts 
even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world). The Māra Samyutta (S.i.103ff ) 
contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him 
with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before 
him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, 
making the rocks of Gijjhakūta fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether 
he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no 
need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his 
hearers (E.g., at Ekasalā; cf. Nigrodha and his fellow Paribbājakas, D.iii.58). 
Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, Māra came in the guise of a 
bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another 
occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were 
distracted. Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pañcasālā, he entered into 
the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl. Māra 
approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; 
this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury 
in addition to neglect. But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that 
day on pīti, like the Abhassara gods. The incident is related at length in 
SA.i.140f. and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the 
difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Verañja 
(q.v.) was also due to the machinations of Māra.</p>
<p>Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on 
Nibbāna, Māra came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if 
anyone had seen his oxen. His desire was to make the cares of the present life 
break in on the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbāna. On 
another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power 
that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers. Once, at the 
Sākyan village of Sīlavatī, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in 
the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the 
things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time. In the same 
village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations. Samiddhi 
sought the Buddha’s help and went back and won arahantship. (Cp. the story of 
Nandiya Thera. Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when Sūrambattha, after 
listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, Māra visited him there 
in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached 
to him earlier was false. Sūrambattha, though surprised, could not be shaken in 
his faith, being a sotāpanna). Māra influenced Godhika to commit suicide and 
tried to frighten Rāhula in the guise of a huge elephant. (DhA.iv.69f ). In the 
account of Godhika’s suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after 
Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his (Godhika’s) consciousness (patisandhicitta), 
and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of 
smoke.” Later, Māra came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddadārakavannī), 
(SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha 
about Godhika. (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks 
regarding Godhika’s destiny.)</p>
<p>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed 
various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots — 
e.g., Ālavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, 
Selā, Vajirā and Khemā. To the same category of temptations belongs a story 
found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his 
journey of Renunciation, Māra, here called Vasavattī, appeared before him and 
promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but 
turn back. Māra’s temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted 
also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness&nbsp;- 
e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife. (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).</p>
<p>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, 
of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; 
the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon 
after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was 
firmly established. Can it be that here we have the word Māra used in the sense 
of physical death (Maccumāra), and that the occasions referred to were those on 
which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to “lay down the 
burden“? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death’s 
door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made 
inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, 
digestive disorders and headache. (It is true that in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta 
(M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the 
Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is 
there any mention of the Bodhi tree. But to argue from this, that such events 
did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences 
from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvagāma, shortly before he finally decided 
to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp. Dvy. 203) that “there fell upon him a dire 
sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death.” But the Buddha 
conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would 
not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of 
the Order. Compare with this Māra’s temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi 
(q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot 
by a splinter. It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which 
at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions 
which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f). We know of 
other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried 
by physical ills — e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, 
Channa. When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free 
from all blame.</p>
<p>Can it be, further, that with the accounts of Māra, as the 
personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named 
Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita 
Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nikāya, Māra is described (aggo 
ādhipateyyānam iddhiyā yasasā jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the 
Kāmāvacara worlds and as a dāmarika devaputta (as mentioned earlier). A.ii.17. 
Even after the Buddha’s death Māra was regarded as wishing to obstruct good 
works. Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha’s relics in the Mahā Thūpa, 
Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the 
universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of Māra (Mhv.xxxi.85).</p>
<p>Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking 
on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) 
that Māradevaputta, having dogged the Buddha’s footsteps for seven years, and 
having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him. Is it, then, 
possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have 
had with Māra — e.g., in the second part of the 
Padhāna Sutta (see above)&nbsp;&nbsp; were originally ascribed to a real 
personage, designated as Māradevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical 
Māra? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the Māratajjaniya 
Sutta (M.i.333; cp. D.iii.79) uttered by Moggallāna, that he too had once been a 
Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age 
was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for 
many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. 
According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great 
power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men. 
This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation. See also 
Mārakāyikā deva.</p>
<p>Māra bears many names in Pāli Literature, chief of them 
being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu. (MNid.ii.489; for their 
explanation see MNidA.328; another name of Māra was Pajāpati, MA.i.28). His 
usual standing epithet is pāpimā, but other words are also used, such as 
anatthakāma, ahitakāma, and ayogakkhemakāma (E.g., M.i.118).</p>
<p>Māra is called Namuci because none can escape him&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Namucī ti Māro; so hi attano visayā nikkhamitukāme devamanusse na muñcati 
antarāyam tesam karoti tasma Namucī ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386). In the Mahāsamaya 
Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly. 
D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p. 261f.) it is said that when all the 
devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his 
“swarthy host” and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc. 
But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and Māra had to 
depart unsuccessful. At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally 
ascribed to Māra. They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers. In 
this sutta Māra is described as mahāsena (having a large army).</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to 
Māradevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he 
was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandikā abhabbā, ayam pi tādiso 
yeva, tasmā dhātuso samsandamāno āgato). Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp. MNidA. 
328) that Māra is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him&nbsp;&nbsp; 
attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte māreti ti Māro; he is called 
Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all&nbsp;&nbsp; Māro nāma vasavattī 
sabesam upari vasam vattati.</p>
<p>
Kālī (Kālā) is the mother of Māra of the present age. See Kālī (4).</p>
