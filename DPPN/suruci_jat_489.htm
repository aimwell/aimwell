  <h2>Suruci Jātaka (No. 489)</h2>

<p>There once reigned in <a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a> a king, named Suruci. He had 
a son also called Suruci-kumāra, who studied at <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, where Prince Brahmadatta of Benares was his fellow student. They became great friends, and 
agreed to bring about an alliance between the two royal houses. Suruci came to 
the throne of Mithilā and had a son called after himself. Brahmadatta became 
king of Benares and had a daughter, Sumedhā. A marriage was arranged between 
Suruci and <a href="sumedhaa.htm" title="s/sumedhaa.htm">Sumedhā</a>, but Brahmadatta agreed to the alliance only on condition 
that Sumedhā should be Suruci’s only wife. Suruci accepted this condition, but, 
though Sumedhā lived in the palace for ten thousand years, she had no child. The 
people clamoured for an heir, but Suruci refused to take another queen, though 
Sumedhā herself obtained for him many thousands of women for his harem, sixteen 
thousand in all. Forty thousand years thus passed, but no child was born in the 
palace.</p>
<p>Then Sumedhā vowed an Act of Truth; <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka’s</a> throne was 
heated, and he asked the god <a href="nalakara.htm" title="n/nalakara.htm">Nalakāra</a> to be born as Sumedhā’s son. 
Nalakāra reluctantly agreed. Then Sakka went to the king’s park disguised as a 
sage and offered to give any woman who was virtuous a son. “If thou seek virtue, 
seek Sumedhā,” they said. He then went to the palace, and having made Sumedhā 
declare to him her virtue, he revealed his identity and promised her a son. In 
due course a son was born — <a href="mahapanaada.htm" title="maha/mahapanaada.htm">Mahāpanāda</a>. He grew up amid great splendour, and, 
when he was sixteen, the king built for him a grand palace.</p>
<p>It is said that Sakka sent <a href="vissakamma.htm" title="vy/vissakamma.htm">Vissakamma</a> as mason to help 
with the building. When the palace was completed, three ceremonies were held on 
the same day: the dedication of the palace, Mahāpanāda’s coronation and his 
marriage. The festival lasted for seven years, and the people began to grumble; 
but the king would not bring the festival to an end, for all this time 
Mahāpanāda had not once laughed, and the king said the feast could not end till 
he was made to laugh. Various people came to amuse him, among them two jugglers, 
<a href="bhandukanna.htm" title="b/bhandukanna.htm">Bhandukanna</a> and <a href="pandu.htm" title="pa/pandu.htm">Pandukanna</a>; but it was not till 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> sent a divine dancer to 
dance the “Half&nbsp; body” dance, in which one half of the body danced while 
the rest stood still, that Mahāpanāda smiled.</p>
<p>The story was related on the occasion on which the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> 
gave <a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a> eight boons. One night there was a great storm, and the Buddha 
asked the monks to drench themselves in the rain as that would be the last great 
rain storm in his time. Together with them the Buddha appeared at Visākhā’s 
house, but as soon as they arrived on the threshold they were quite dry.</p>
<p>Bhaddaji is identified with Mahāpanāda, Visākhā with 
Sumedhā, Ānanda with Vissakamma, and the Bodhisatta, was Sakka. J.iv.314-25; cf. 
DA.iii.856f.; and J.ii.334.</p>
