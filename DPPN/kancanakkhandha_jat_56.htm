  <h2>Kañcanakkhandha Jātaka (No. 56)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a farmer 
and, while ploughing his field, came upon a nugget of gold, four cubits long and 
as thick as a man’s thigh, which had been buried by a merchant in bygone days. 
Finding it impossible to remove the gold as a whole, he cut it into four and 
carried it home easily. The story was related in reference to a monk who wished 
to leave the Order because he was frightened by all the rules his teachers asked 
him to learn and obey. The Buddha gave him three rules — to guard voice, body 
and mind — and the monk won arahantship. Even a heavy burden becomes light if 
carried piece by piece. J.i.276-8.</p>
