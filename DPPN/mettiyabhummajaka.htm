  <h2>Mettiyabhummajakā</h2>

<p>A group of monks, followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka 
forming part of the Chabbaggiyā (q.v.). They lived near Rājagaha. Sp.iii.614; 
J.ii.387; Sp.iii.579 says they were the chief leaders of the Chabbaggiyā.</p>
<p>Twice they brought an unfounded charge of breach of 
morality against <a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabba Mallaputta</a>, who seems to have earned their special 
dislike. Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the ārāma where they 
stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder 
who had a reputation for providing good food. When, however, the man heard from 
Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajakā to receive his hospitality, 
he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them. The 
monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the 
householder. They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyā to go to the Buddha 
and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity. The charge was investigated 
and proved false and the nun expelled from the Order (Vin.ii.76ff.; iii.160ff).</p>
<p>On another occasion, these monks persuaded a Licchavi, 
named <a href="vaddha.htm" title="va/vaddha.htm">Vaddha</a>, who was their patron and friend, to go to the Buddha and charge 
Dabba with having had relations with his wife. This, too, was proved false, and 
other monks refused to accept alms from Vaddha until he had confessed his guilt 
(Vin.ii.124ff). One day, while descending from Gijjhakūta, the Mettiyabhummajakā 
monks saw a heifer with a she goat and the idea occurred to them of calling the 
heifer Dabba and the she goat Mettiyā and then of spreading the story that they 
had seen Dabba mating with Mettiyā.</p>
<p>Vin.iii.166ff.; see also iv. 37f., 
<a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> mentions a 
tradition, but contradicts it, that the persecution of Dabba by the 
Mettiyabhummajakā was so persistent that in the end he committed suicide to 
escape from it (UdA.431). In any case, they managed to bring him into disfavour 
with the laity, and the Buddha had to take special steps to reinstate him in 
their esteem (UdA.434). The incident regarding the charge brought by Mettiyā 
seems to have given much trouble to later commentators. Sp.iii.582 says that 
there was a great dispute about this between the monks of the 
<a href="mahavihara.htm" title="maha/mahavihara.htm">Mahāvihāra</a> and 
those of <a href="abhayagiri.htm" title="am/abhayagiri.htm">Abhayagiri</a>. In the end, King Bhātikatissa intervened and had the matter 
settled by <a href="diigha_kaaraayana.htm" title="d/diigha_kaaraayana.htm">Dīghakārāyana</a>.</p>
