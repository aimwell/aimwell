<p>1. Kacchapa Jātaka (No. 178).-The story 
of a tortoise who would not leave the lake where he lived even though all the 
other tortoises, knowing there would be a drought, swam in time to the 
neighbouring river. When the drought came, he buried himself in a hole. There he 
was dug up by the Bodhisatta who was digging for clay, having been born as a 
potter. The tortoise’s shell was cracked by the potter’s spade and he died, 
having uttered two verses on the folly of clinging too much to things. The 
Bodhisatta took his body to the village and preached to the villagers.</p>
<p>The story was told to a young man of 
Sāvatthi who, when the plague broke out in his house, listened to his parents' 
advice and escaped through a hole in the wall. When the danger was past he 
returned and rescued the treasure hoarded in the house and, one day, visited the 
Buddha with many gifts.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with the tortoise 
of the story. J.ii.79-81.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kacchapa Jātaka (No. 215).-The story 
of a tortoise who became friendly with two geese living in the Cittakūta 
mountain. One day the geese invited the tortoise to their abode, and when he 
agreed they made him hold a stick between his teeth, and seizing the two ends 
flew away with him. The children of the village, seeing them, started shouting, 
and the tortoise, being of a talkative nature, opened his mouth to reprimand 
them and fell near the palace of the king of Benares, crushing himself to death. 
The Bodhisatta, who was the king’s minister, seized the opportunity for 
admonishing his master, who was an inveterate talker, on the virtues of silence.</p>
<p>The tortoise is identified with Kokālika, 
in reference to whom the story was related (J.ii.175-8; repeated also in 
DhA.iv.91f). For details see the Mahātakkāri Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Kacchapa Jātaka (No. 273).-The story 
of how a monkey insulted a tortoise by introducing his private parts into the 
tortoise as the latter lay basking in the sun with his mouth open. The tortoise 
caught hold of the monkey and refused to release him. The monkey went for help, 
and the Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic in a hermitage near by, saw the monkey 
carrying the tortoise. The Bodhisatta persuaded the tortoise to release the 
monkey.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the quarrelsome ministers of the king of Kosala. J.ii.359-61.</p>
