  <h2>Kundadhāna Thera</h2>

<p>An arahant. He was proclaimed the first 
among those who received food tickets (salāka) (A.i.24). He came of a brahmin 
family of Sāvatthi and his name was Dhāna. He knew the Vedas by heart, and when 
advanced in years, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. From that day, 
however, in all his movements the form of a young woman followed him wherever he 
went, though he himself could not see the figure. This caused great merriment 
and evoked many sarcastic remarks, which he could not understand. When he went 
for alms women would put into his bowl two portions of food, saying, “One is for 
your Reverence and the other for your friend, the young lady, your companion.” 
In the monastery the novices and young monks would point at him and say: “Look, 
our venerable one has become a konda” (gallant?). From this he became known as 
Konda- or Kundadhāna. Driven to distraction by this teasing, he became abusive 
and was reported to the Buddha, who hade him be patient as he was only being 
pursued by the remnant of an evil kamma. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of 
Kundadhāna, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that 
the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no 
longer go round for alms. This enabled him to concentrate his mind, and he 
became an arahant. Thereupon the figure of the woman disappeared.</p>
<p>Kundadhāna’s claim to be the first among 
receivers of salāka was due to the fact that he it was who received the first 
food-ticket when the Buddha visited </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Mahā-Subhaddā at Ugganagara, 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Culla-Subhaddā at Sāketa, and also
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Sunāparanta-janapada. </li>
</ul>
<p>Only khīnāsavas were allowed to 
accompany the Buddha on these visits.</p>
<p>Kundadhāna’s determination to attain 
this special eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. Once he gave 
Padumuttara a well-ripened “comb” of bananas when the Buddha arose from a long 
trance. As a result he became king of the devas eleven times and king of men 
twenty-four times.</p>
<p>He was an earthbound sprite in the time 
of Kassapa Buddha. Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha 
held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and 
when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he 
followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her 
hair, adjusting her garments, and so on. The second monk, seeing his friend 
return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing 
to perform the uposatha with him. Realising the effect of his practical joke, 
the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks 
was for ever spoilt. The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole 
Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadhāna his evil kamma pursued him, 
as seen above. AA.i.146ff; Thag.A.i.62ff; also Ap.i.81f; Thag.15. The version 
given in Dh A.iii.52f differs very slightly in certain details.</p>
<p>Kundadhāna was among those to whom the 
Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta, and was therefore probably a friend of 
Anuruddha and the other Sākyan nobles present on that occasion (M.i.462). v.l. 
Konda-dhāna, Konthadhāna, Kuddadhāna.</p>
