  <h2>Kundala (v.l. Kulakundala) Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An arahant. He came of a brahmin family 
of Sāvatthi and entered the Order, but from want of mental balance he could not 
concentrate his thoughts. Then, one day, while begging for alms, he saw how men 
conducted water whither they wished by digging channels, how the fletcher fixed 
the arrow shaft in his lathe surveying it from the corner of his eye, how the 
chariot-makers planed axle and tire and hub. Dwelling on these things, he soon 
attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the past he was a park-keeper, and 
gave a coconut to the Buddha Vipassī, which the Buddha accepted while travelling 
through the air (ThagA.i.71f). </p>
<p>Perhaps he is to be identified with 
Nālikeradāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.447f). The same Apadāna-verses, however, 
are also ascribed to Khitaka Thera (ThagA.i.315f). </p>
<p>The verse attributed to Kundala in the 
Theragāthā (Thag.19) occurs twice in the Dhammapada, and is in the Dhammapada 
Commentary mentioned as having been preached once in reference to 
Pandita-Sāmanera (DhA.ii.147), and once in reference to Sukha-Sāmanera 
(DhA.iii.99).</p>
