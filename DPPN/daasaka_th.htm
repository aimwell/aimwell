<p>1. Dāsaka Thera.-He was born in Sāvatthi 
and was appointed by Anāthapindika to look after the vihāra. There, being 
impressed by what he saw and heard, he entered the Order. Some say that he was 
the son of a slave-woman of Anāthapindika. The setthi was pleased with him and 
freed him that he might become a monk. It is said that in a previous birth he 
had ordered an arahant to do some work for him, hence his birth as a slave. From 
the time he was ordained he became slothful and fond of sleep. The Buddha 
admonished him, and, much agitated, he put forth effort and realised 
arahantship.</p>
<p>Ninety-one kappas ago he met the Pacceka 
Buddha Ajita and gave him some beautiful mangoes to eat. Later, in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha, he was a monk (Thag.17; ThagA.i.68ff).</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this same Dāsaka who is 
mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.127ff; SA.ii.230) as having been sent by 
the monks of Kosambī to Khemaka, carrying messages to and fro till he had walked 
up and down over two yojanas.</p>
<p>2. Dāsaka Thera.-Friend of Sonaka and 
pupil of Upāli. He was a learned brahmin of Vesāli, and, meeting Upāli at the 
Vālikārāma, had a discussion with him, at the end of which he entered the Order 
for the purpose of studying the Doctrine. He learnt the whole of the Tipitaka 
and became an arahant. Later he ordained Sonaka, son of the caravan-guide, and 
teacher of Siggava and Candavajji. After Upāli’s death, Dāsaka became chief of 
the teachers of the Vinaya. Mhv.v.104ff; Dpv.iv.28ff; v.77ff; Vin.v.2; Sp.i.32, 
235; but see Dvy.3ff.</p>
