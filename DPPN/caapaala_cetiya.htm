  <h2>Cāpāla-cetiya</h2>

</ul>
<p>A shrine near <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. </p>
<p>Here the Buddha, 
three months before his parinibbāna, definitely decided to accede to the request 
of Māra that he should die.  </p>
<p>When he announced this decision the earth shook 
(D.ii.102ff; A.iv.308f; S.v.260f.; Ud.vi.1; Dvy.201, 207; Mtu.i.209f; iii.306). 
 
</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (i.457) states that during the first twenty years of 
the Buddha’s ministry, he sometimes dwelt in Cāpāla-cetiya. It was once the 
residence of the Yakkha Cāpāla, but, later, a vihāra was erected on the site for 
the use of the Buddha (UdA.322f).  </p>
<p>Fa Hsien found a pagoda there and relates a 
story in connection with it (p.43).</p>
