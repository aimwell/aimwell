<p><b>1. Buddhasaññaka Thera.</b> An arahant. In the time of 
Vipassī Buddha he was an earth bound deva, and when, at the death of the Buddha, 
the earth trembled, he realized the Buddha’s might and honoured him in his 
heart. Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samita (Ap.i.151f). He is 
probably identical with Meghiya Thera. ThagA.i.149f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Buddhasaññaka Thera.</b> Ninety four kappas ago he 
saw Siddhattha Buddha and his heart was gladdened. Ap.i.252.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Buddhasaññaka. </b>A hermit in the time of 
Siddhattha Buddha. Having heard from his pupils of the birth of the Buddha, he 
set forth from his hermitage to visit him. But he fell ill while yet one hundred 
and fifty leagues away, and he died full of faith in the Buddha (Ap.ii.420). He 
is probably identical with Vītasoka Thera. ThagA.i.295f.</p>
