<p><b>1. Vitakka Sutta. </b>Sense desire thinking is got rid 
of by renunciation, ill will thinking and harm thinking by the cultivation of 
their opposites. A.iii.446.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vitakka Sutta.</b> Concentration accompanied by 
thought, both directed and sustained, only sustained, neither directed nor 
sustained, is the path which leads to the “Uncompounded.” S.iv.360.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vitakka Sutta. </b>Thoughts of lust, hatred, and 
delusion are unprofitable. Thoughts of ill, its cause, etc., are concerned with 
profit. S.v.417.</p>
