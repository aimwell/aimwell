  <h2>Vacchanakha Jātaka (No. 235)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Vacchanakha, an anchorite 
living in the Himālaya, and on one occasion, having gone to Benares for salt and 
seasoning, he stayed in the king’s garden. A rich man saw him and, pleased with 
his looks, attended to his wants. A friendship soon grew up between them, and 
the rich man invited the hermit to give up his robes and share his wealth. But 
this offer the hermit refused, pointing out the disadvantages of household life.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an attempt of Roja, the 
Malla, friend of Ānanda, to tempt the latter back to the worldly life by 
offering him half his possessions. Roja is identified with the rich man of the 
story. J.ii.231ff.</p>
