  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Pāli Dictionary written in the twelfth 
century by Moggallāna Thera of Ceylon, following the style and the method of the 
Sanskrit Amarakosa. </p>
<p>It is in three parts, dealing with 
“celestial, terrestrial and miscellaneous objects,” and each part is sub divided 
into several sections, which are not all mutually exclusive. The whole book is a 
dictionary of synonyms, all the names given to one particular thing being 
grouped together and put into verse for the purpose of memorisation.</p>
<p>A Samvannanā was written by a Burmese 
Officer-of-State under King Kittisīhasūra (A.D. 1351), and there exists a 
Burmese translation of the eighteenth century. In Ceylon itself a sanna 
(paraphrase) and a tīkā have been written, the sanna being the older and by far 
the more valuable work. Gv.62, 63; Svd.v.1253; Sad.65; see also P.L.C. 187-9; 
Bode, op. cit., 67.</p>
