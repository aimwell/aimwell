</ul>
<p>Younger brother of Bhātikābhaya and king of Ceylon for 
twelve years (67-79 A.C.). He made a courtyard of 
kincikkha stones on plaster round the Mahā Thūpa, and built the Ambatthala thūpa, 
making it firm at the risk of his own life. He placed chairs for the preachers 
in all the vihāras of Ceylon, and laid out the grounds round Cetiyagiri, holding 
a great celebration called the Giribhandapūjā (q.v.). From the Kadambanadī to 
Cetiyagiri he laid carpets for the comfort of pilgrims. He built the 
Manināgapabbata, the Kalanda, the Samudda, and the Cūlānāgapabbata Vihāras, and 
gave land for the use of monks in Pāsānadīpaka and Mandavāpi Vihāras in 
gratitude for favours shown him by novices of these monasteries. He had two 
sons, Ānanda gāmani Abhaya and Kanirajānutissa, both of whom succeeded to the 
throne. Mhv.xxxiv. 68ff.; xxxv.l.9; Dpv.xxi.34. </p>
<p>He had a queen called Damiladevī (apparently a Tamil lady) 
who died young. AA.i.13.</p>
