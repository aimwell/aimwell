<p><b>1. Sāmā.</b> The chief woman disciple of 
<a href="kakusandha.htm" title="ka/kakusandha.htm">Kakusandha</a> 
Buddha. Bu.xxiii.21; J.i.42.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sāmā.</b> One of the chief lay women disciples of 
<a href="konaagamana.htm" title="ku/konaagamana.htm">Konāgamana</a> Buddha. Bu.xxiv.24.</p>

<p><b>3. Sāmā.</b> A courtesan of Benares; for her story see 
the <a href="kanavera_jat_318.htm" title="ka/kanavera_jat_318.htm">Kanavera Jātaka</a>. J.iii.59ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sāmā Therī. </b>She belonged to an eminent family of 
Kosambī, and when her friend <a href="samavati.htm" title="sa/samavati.htm">Sāmāvatī</a> died she left the world in distress of 
mind. Unable to subdue her grief, she could not grasp the Ariyan way. One day, 
while listening to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda’s</a> preaching, she won insight, and, on the seventh day 
from then became an arahant. Thig.vs.37 8; ThigA.44.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sāmā Therī. </b>She belonged to a family of Kosambī 
and left the world in distress on the loss of her friend, <a href="samavati.htm" title="sa/samavati.htm">Sāmāvatī</a>. For twenty 
five years she was unable to gain self mastery, till, in her old age, she heard 
a sermon and won arahantship.</p>
<p>Ninety one kappas ago she was a kinnarī on the banks of 
the Candabhāga. One day, while amusing herself in company of her friends, she 
saw Vipassī Buddha and worshipped him with salala flowers (Thig.39 41; 
ThigA.45f). She is evidently identical with Salalapupphikā of the Apadāna. 
Ap.ii.524.</p>
