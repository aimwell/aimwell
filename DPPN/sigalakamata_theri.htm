<p>She belonged to a setthi’s family in Rājagaha and, after 
marriage, had a son called Sigālaka. She heard the Buddha preach and entered the 
Order. She was full of faith, and, when she went to hear the Buddha preach, 
would gaze at his beauty of personality. The Buddha, realizing her nature, 
preached so that her faith might reach its culmination, and, in due course, she 
became an arahant. Later she was declared chief of nuns who had attained release 
by faith (saddhādhimuttānam).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she belonged to a 
minister’s family, and once went with her father to hear the Buddha preach. Full 
of faith, she entered the Order, and, hearing a nun declared foremost of those 
who had faith, she wished for similar eminence (A.i.25; AA.i.206f).</p>
<p>According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.603f), she was the mother 
of Sigāla(-ka), to whom the Buddha preached the sutta regarding the worship of 
the directions (evidently the Sigālovāda Sutta). She heard the sermon and became 
a sotāpanna.</p>
