  <h2>Cha-Chakkha Sutta</h2>

<p>Preached at Jetavana. The Buddha 
explains to the assembled monks the six “sixes” — e.g., the six internal senses 
(hearing etc.), the six external sense-objects (form etc.), the six groups of 
perceptions (sight and forms, hearing and sounds, etc.), and the six groups of 
cravings (M.iii.280ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary (MA.ii.1024f) says that, 
apart from the sixty monks who became arahants when the Buddha first preached 
the sutta, on each occasion of its preaching, by the Chief Disciples and by the 
eighty chief disciples, a like number attained arahantship. In Ceylon, 
Maliyadeva Thera preached it at sixty different places, and each time sixty 
monks became arahants. Once, when Tipitaka-Cūlanāga preached it at the 
Ambilahālavihāra, one thousand monks attained to arahantship (MA.ii.1025).</p>
