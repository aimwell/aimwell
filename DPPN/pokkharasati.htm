  <h2>Pokkharasāti, Pokkharasādi</h2>

<p>A Mahāsāla brahmin of great wealth and learning who lived 
in Ukkatthā, on a royal demesne given by Pasenadi. Ambattha was the pupil of 
Pokkharasāti, who sent him to the Buddha at Icchānangala to discover if the 
report of the Buddha’s greatness were true. When Pokkharasāti heard later that 
Ambattha had been rude to the Buddha, he sought the Buddha by night and begged 
for his forgiveness. The next day he invited the Buddha to a meal, and having 
listened to his teaching, declared himself his follower and became a sotāpanna 
(D.i.87f., 106ff). Owing to his eminence, he was present at the meetings of the 
brahmins held in Manasākata (D.i.235) and Icchānangala (SN.p.115). Vasettha, of 
the Vāsettha Sutta, was also his pupil (SN.vs.594). In the Subha Sutta 
(M.ii.200ff)*, Subha Todeyyaputta, another disciple, is reported to have said 
that Pokkharasāti — here described as Opamañña (of the Upamañña clan) and lord 
of Subhagavana (Subhapvanika)&nbsp;&nbsp; treated as empty boasts the claims of 
brahmins and recluses to transcend ordinary human bonds and rise to the height 
of Ariyan knowledge. This evidently refers to a time prior to his conversion. 
The same Sutta mentions a slave girl of Pokkharasāti, Punnikā by name.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* the Vimānavatthu gives the name of another of his 
  disciples, Chattamānava (q.v.), who was killed while bringing presents to his 
  teacher. (Vv.v.3; VvA.229ff.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commentaries (DA.i.244f.; MA.ii.804; SNA.462) dwell at 
length on Pokkharasāti’s attractive personality. His body was of the color of 
the white lotus, like a silver pandal in heaven, his hair the color of sapphire, 
his eyes like blue lotus, etc. He evidently was of true regal appearance.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin versed in 
the three Vedas who, having heard the doctrine and given alms, was reborn in the 
deva world. Thereafter, scorning birth in the womb of a woman, he sprang to life 
in a lotus, which grew in a pond in Himāva. An ascetic saw the lotus, adopted 
the boy, and taught him the Vedas. The king was pleased with his great learning, 
and gave him Ukkatthā as a mark of great favor. The name of Pokkharasāti was 
given to him owing to his birth in a lotus.</p>
<p>The Divyāvadāna (p. 616 ff., 620) calls him Puskarasārī, 
and tells a story of his daughter Prakrti.</p>
