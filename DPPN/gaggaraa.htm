<p><b>1. GaggarÄ.</b>-A lotus-pond at CampÄ.  </p>
<p>The 
Buddha is several times mentioned as staying on the banks of the pond. On one 
such occasion Pessa and Kandaraka visited him, and he preached to them the 
Kandaraka Sutta (M.i.339). Among others who visited him there are mentioned 
BÄhuna (A.v.151), VajjiyamÄhita (A.v.189), and Kassapagotta (Vin.i.312). On one 
occasion, when the Buddha was staying there, SÄriputta approached him with a 
large number of the inhabitants of Campà and asked him questions concerning the 
efficacy of giving alms (A.iv.59ff).</p>
<p>On another such occasion SÄriputta 
assembled the monks and preached to them the Dasuttara Sutta (D.iii.272ff). It 
was on the banks of the GaggarÄ that the Buddha preached the Karandava Sutta 
(q.v.) on the necessity of getting rid of evil-minded members of the Sangha lest 
they should corrupt the whole Order (A.iv.168f), and the pond-bank was also the 
scene of the preaching of the well-known Sonadanda Sutta (D.i.111f). Once, when 
the Buddha was at this spot with a large number of monks and lay-followers, 
VangÄ«sa came up to him and praised him in a song, pointing out how the Buddha 
outshone them all (S.i.195; Thag.v.1252; ThagA.ii.210).</p>
<p>The pond was called GaggarÄ because it 
owed its origin to a queen of that name. On its bank was a Campaka-grove where 
the Buddha stayed during his visits (MA.ii.565; DA.i.279f). Nearby was a 
monastery of titthiyas. (See A.v.189). The pond, together with that at Jetavana, 
is given as an example of a very beautiful lotus pond (E g., AA.i.264). 
Monks found it a convenient spot for meditation (SNA.i.17).</p>
