<p>A monastery to the east of Anurādhapura, built by 
Devānampiyatissa in the first year of his reign (Mhv.xx.25). Its site was one of 
the resting places of the Bodhi tree on the way from Jambukola to Anurādhapura. 
There Mahinda and the monks were given a morning meal, and Mahinda preached on 
the subduing of the Nāgas by the Buddha. Ibid.,xix.34f.</p>
