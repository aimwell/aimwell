<p>Once a novice, returning from his alms round, entered his 
cell and sat down in silence and at ease, not helping the monks with the robe 
making.  </p>
<p>This was reported to the Buddha, who sent for the monk.  </p>
<p>The Buddha 
discovered his abilities, and told the monks to leave him alone as he was one 
who could win, without toil, the four jhƒÅnas (S.ii.277).</p>
