<p>The bodhi-tree planted by 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> at the 
entrance to <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>.  </p>
<p>The people of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, led by 
<a href="anaathapindika.htm" title="ay/anaathapindika.htm">Anāthapindika</a>, suggested to Ānanda that some place should be provided where they might offer flowers and 
perfumes in the name of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, when the Buddha was away on his periodical 
tours. </p>
<p>After consultation with the Buddha, Ānanda obtained, with 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna’s</a> 
assistance, a fruit from the bodhi-tree at <a href="gayaa.htm" title="g/gayaa.htm">Gayā</a>, and had it planted at the 
gateway of Jetavana in the presence of a large and distinguished gathering, 
including <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> Kosala and
<a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a>.  </p>
<p>The seed was planted by Anāthapindika in 
a golden jar filled with fragrant earth. Immediately a sapling sprang up, fifty 
cubits tall, with five branches, each fifty cubits long.  </p>
<p>The king poured round 
the tree perfumed water from eight hundred jars of gold and silver.  </p>
<p>In order to 
consecrate the new tree, the Buddha, at Ānanda’s request, sat under it for one 
night, in the rapture of samāpatti.  </p>
<p>Because the tree was planted by Ānanda, it 
became known as Ānandabodhi (J.iv.228-30).  </p>
<p>Pilgrims who came to the Buddha at 
Jetavana were in the habit of paying respect to the Ānandabodhi (J.ii.321).  </p>
<p>The <a href="paduma_jat_261.htm">Paduma Jātaka</a> and the <a href="kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm">Kālingabodhi Jātaka</a> were both preached in reference to this bodhi-tree.</p>
