<p>The Buddha goes with Ānanda on his 
begging round in Vesāli and, after the meal, rests at the Cāpāla Cetiya. There 
the Buddha sings the praises of Vesāli and declares that, if he would, he could 
live for a whole kappa. Ānanda does not act on the hint. When Ānanda leaves him, 
Māra asks that the Buddha should die, as his disciples have been fully trained. 
The Buddha agrees, and declares that he will die in three months time. 
S.v.258ff; the incident is also given in D.ii.102ff and Ud.vi.1.</p>
