<h4>1. Nisabha</h4>
<p>One of the two chief disciples of Anomadassī Buddha 
(Bu.viii.22; J.i.36; DhA.i.88). </p>
<p>Pañcasīlasamādāniya Thera took the precepts from him in 
the time of Anomadassī Buddha. Ap.i.76; also 74 (?).</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nisabba</h4>
<p>One of the chief lay supporters of Atthadassi Buddha. 
Bu.xv.21.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nisabha</h4>
<p>Also called Mahānisabha, chief among the dhutahgadharas in 
the time of Padumuttara Buddha. It was his example that prompted Mahā Kassapa to 
strive for a similar honour. ThagA.ii.134f.; SA.ii.135f.; AA.i.85f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nisabha Thera</h4>
<p>He was born in a Koliyan family, and, having seen the 
Buddha’s wisdom and power in the fight between the Sākyans and the Koliyans, he 
entered the Order and became an arahant. Two verses uttered by him in admonition 
of a fellow worker are found in the Therāgathā (vs.195f.). In time of Vipassī 
Buddha he was a householder, and gave to the Buddha a kapittha fruit 
(Thag.i.318). He is probably identical with Kapitthaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.ii.449; but see also ThagA.i.73.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nisabha</h4>
<p>A mountain in Himavā. J.vi.204, 212; Ap.i.67.</p>
