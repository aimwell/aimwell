<p>Preached at Venāgapura. The brahmins of that village visit 
the Buddha, and their leader Vacchagotta expresses his admiration of the 
Buddha’s translucent colour in various similes, suggesting that it may be due to 
the luxurious beds on which the Buddha is able to sleep. The Buddha, however, 
answers that the costly beds mentioned by Vacchagotta are not for recluses like 
himself, but that he has three different “couches,” each of which gives him 
great comfort of body and mind: the broad celestial (dibba) couch, the sublime 
couch, and the Ariyan couch. He explains the nature of these couches and of the 
four jhānas. The Venāgapura brahmins thereupon accept the Buddha as their 
teacher. A.i.180ff.</p>
