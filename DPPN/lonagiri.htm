<p><b>1. Lonagiri.</b> A vihāra on the banks of the 
  Ajakaranī, where Sabbaka (Sappaka) attained arahantship. v.l. Lena vihāra. 
  ThagA.i.399.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Lonagiri.</b> A vihāra in Ceylon, near Mahākhīragāma (v.l. Mahāgirigāma). 
In the Commentaries (AA.ii.653f.; M.A.i.546f.; DA.ii.534f ) we find two stories 
about a monk named Tissa, who lived there. Once, five hundred monks, on their 
way to Nāgadīpa, reached Khīragāma and went into the village for alms, but 
returned with empty bowls. When Tissa. discovered this, he went into the 
village, whence he shortly returned with his bowl full of milk rice, which he 
served to the five hundred monks, keeping some for himself. When asked whether 
he possessed supernormal power, Tissa replied that he practised Sārānīyadhammā, 
as a result of which his bowl was never empty even after he had served as many 
as one thousand monks from it.</p>
<p>The other story relates how, when Tissa was still a 
novice, he went to the Giribhanda festival. There, having heard that the 
costliest offering was a pair of robes, he openly wished that he should get 
them. The king heard of this and tried to prevent Tissa from having the robes, 
but this effort was unsuccessful. The king was amazed, and, on questioning 
Tissa, the reply was to the same effect as that of the first story. v.l. 
Lenagiri.</p>
