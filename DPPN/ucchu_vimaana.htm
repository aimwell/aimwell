<p>1. Ucchu-vimāna, also called 
Ucchudāyikā-vimāna. A girl, who belonged to a pious family in Rājagaha, used to 
give to holy men half of anything she received. She was given in marriage to a 
family of unbelievers. One day she saw Moggallāna going about for alms, and 
having invited him to her house she gave him a piece of sugar cane which had 
been set aside for her mother-in-law, whose approval of the gift she hoped to 
win. But when the mother-in-law heard of what had happened in her absence, she 
flew into a rage and struck the girl with a stool. The girl died immediately and 
was born in Tāvatimsa.</p>
<p>Later she visited Moggallāna and 
revealed her identity. Her palace came to be called Ucchudāyikā-vimāna. Vv.24f; 
VvA.124ff.</p>
<p>2. Ucchu-vimāna.-The story is the same 
as the above except that the mother in-law struck the girl with a clod of earth. 
Vv.44f; VvA.203ff.</p>
