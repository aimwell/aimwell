<p>A seven-year-old novice, an arahant who 
offered to perform a miracle herself, so that the Buddha might be saved the 
trouble of performing the Twin Miracle. She offered to fetch Sineru, the 
Cakkavālapabbata and Himavā, and to soar over their tops like a wild goose 
(DhA.iii.211). </p>
<p>She is probably identical with the 
Bhikkhunī mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.213) as having won the praise of a 
Yakkha.</p>
