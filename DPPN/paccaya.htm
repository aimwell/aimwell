<h4>1. Paccaya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. He belonged to a noble family of Rohī (Rohinī) 
and succeeded to his father’s estate. Once, when he was holding a ceremonial 
oblation, a great number of people assembled, and the Buddha, arriving among 
them, preached from the sky, seated in a jewelled pavilion made for him by 
Vessavana. Paccaya heard the preaching and renounced the world, attaining 
arahantship in a few days, and not leaving his cell till he had developed 
insight.</p>
<p>It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Paccaya was 
a monk who refused to leave the vihāra till he gained insight, but he died 
before his purpose was fulfilled. Earlier, ninety one kappas ago, he had come 
across the Buddha Vipassī, on the banks of the Vinatā, and had offered him a fig 
(udumbara) (Thag. vss. 222 4; ThagA.i.341f). He is probably identical with 
Udumbaraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.295.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Paccaya</h4>
<p>The state elephant of Vessantara, brought to the stall by 
a female flying elephant, on the day of his birth, and deposited there. He was 
white in colour, and was called Paccaya because he supplied a need of Vemantara. 
J.vi.485.</p>

<h4>Paccaya Sutta</h4>
<p>An explanation of the teaching regarding Paticcasamuppāda. 
S.ii.25f.</p>
