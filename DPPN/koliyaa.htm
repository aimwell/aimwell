  <h2>Koliyā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the republican clans in the time 
of the Buddha. The Koliyā owned two chief settlements — one at Rāmagāma and the 
other at Devadaha. The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; 
ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas. We are 
told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and 
explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being 
detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and 
retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon 
recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five 
daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy. Rāma, having 
cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the 
king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in 
doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site 
was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā. 
The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā. </p>
<p>According to the Kunālā Jātaka 
(J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the 
Koliyans had once “lived like animals in a Kola-tree,” as their name signified. 
The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the 
river Rohinī. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed 
relationship with the Buddha. (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried 
away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the 
Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262). A quarrel once arose between 
the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated 
the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention 
of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the 
membership of the Order, and during the Buddha’s stay in the neighbourhood, he 
lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara. (For details of this 
quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).</p>
<p>Attached probably to the Koliyan central 
authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a 
distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā). They bore a 
bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).</p>
<p>Besides the places already mentioned, 
several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his 
disciples, are mentioned in literature — e.g.,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Uttara, the residence of the 
headman Pātaliya (S.iv.340); </li>
  <li>Sajjanela, residence of 
Suppavāsā (A.ii.62); </li>
  <li>Sāpūga, where Ānanda once stayed 
(A.ii.194); </li>
  <li>Kakkarapatta, where lived Dīghajānu 
(A.iv.281); and </li>
  <li>Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and 
Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115). </li>
</ul>
<p>Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) 
(attendant of Moggallāna), and Kankhā-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona 
Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death the Koliyans of 
Rāmagāma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha’s relics, over which they 
erected a thūpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff). See also s.v. Suppavāsā.</p>
