  <h2>Mahāgavaccha Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was the son of Samiddhi, a brahmin of Nālaka in 
Magadha. Mahāgavaccha admired Sāriputta greatly, and on learning that he had 
joined the Order, he followed Sāriputta’s example, becoming an arahant in due 
course.</p>
<p>In the past he gave a drink of water to Padumuttara Buddha 
and was a devout follower of Sikhī Buddha (Thag.vs.12; ThagA.i.57). He is 
probably identical with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.437; but the same 
verses are attributed to Gangātiriya (ThagA.i.249).</p>
