  <h2>Mahā Kotthita (Mahā Kotthika) Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked 
foremost among masters of logical analysis (patisambhidappattānam) (A.i.24; 
Dpv.iv.5; v. 9). He was born into a very wealthy brahmin family of Sāvatthi, his 
father being Assalāyana and his mother Candavatī.</p>
<p>He gained great proficiency in the Vedas and, after 
hearing the Buddha preach (to his father, says the Apadāna account), entered the 
Order and, engaging in meditation, soon became an arahant.</p>
<p>He was extremely skilled in knowledge of the Patisambhidā, 
on which were based all his questions to the Buddha and his own colleagues.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a rich 
householder, and, hearing the Buddha praise a monk as foremost among those 
skilled in the Patisambhidā, he wished for similar eminence for himself in the 
future. To this end he visited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them for 
seven days, giving them three robes each at the conclusion of his almsgiving. 
Owing to the skill showed by him in the Mahā Veddha Sutta (q.v.), the Buddha 
declared him foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā (Thag.vs.2; 
ThagA.i.29ff.; AA.i.159; Ap.ii.479; also Avadānas ii.195).</p>
<p>Several instances are given of discussions between 
Kotthita and other eminent theras — e.g., the 
Nalakalāpiya Sutta on kamma (S.ii.112f), the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline 
(S.iii.165ff), three suttas on samudayadhamma (the nature of arising), two on 
assāda (satisfaction) (S.iii.172-7), two on samudaya (arising) (S.iii.173) and 
three on avijjā and vijjā (S.iii.17). Another similar sutta is on sense and 
sense objects (S.iv.162-5), and there is a series of suttas on matters not 
revealed by the Buddha (avyākatāni). S.iv.384-91; Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests 
(KS.i.79i n.1) that all these suttas were compiled rather as “lessons” to be 
learnt than as genuine inquiries by Kotthita. The pre eminent monks were 
“playing” at teacher and pupil in order to aid Kotthita to win proficiency as a 
teacher. Another such “lesson” is given at A.iv.382ff., as to the motives 
guiding those who live the brahmacariya life.</p>
<p>All these suttas took the form of discussions with 
Sāriputta, in which Mahā Kotthita is the questioner and Sāriputta the 
instructor.</p>
<p>One sutta (S.iv.145 7) records a “lesson” given by the 
Buddha to Kotthita on conceptions of anicca, dukkha and anattā. The Anguttara 
Nikāya (see the Kāyasakkhi Sutta, A.i.118f) records a discussion at Jetavana 
between Savittha, Kotthita and Sāriputta, as to who is best: one who has 
testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by 
faith. Another discussion (A.ii.161f) takes place between Sāriputta and Kotthita 
as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of 
contact (Nibbāna). Once there was a dispute between Kotthita and Citta 
Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were 
gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by 
Kotthita to abide his time and not interrupt. Citta’s friends protested that 
Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Kotthita declared 
that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the 
Order. And so it happened (A.iii.392ff).</p>
<p>Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Kotthita; the 
Theragāthā (Thag.vss.1006 8; ThagA.ii.117) contains three stanzas in which 
Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.</p>
