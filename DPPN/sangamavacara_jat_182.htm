<p>The Bodhisatta was once a skilled elephant trainer. The 
king, in whose service he was, attacked Benares, riding the state elephant; but 
the elephant was so soared by the missiles and noise that he would not approach 
the place. Thereupon his trainer encouraged him, telling him that he should feel 
at home on the battlefield, and the elephant, impressed by his words, broke down 
all obstacles and achieved victory for his master.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the Buddha’s step 
brother Nanda (q..v), who, at first, kept the precepts of the Order, because the 
Buddha had promised to get for him the dove footed nymphs (kakutapādiniyo) of 
Sakka’s heaven; but later, moved by Sāriputta’s words, he put forth effort and 
attained arahantship. Nanda was the elephant and Ānanda the king. J.ii.92 5.</p>
