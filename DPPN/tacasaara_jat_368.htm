<p>Once a poor village doctor saw some boys 
playing near a tree, in the hollow of which lived a snake. Hoping to make some 
money, he asked one of the boys, who was the Bodhisatta, to put his hand into 
the hollow of the tree, saying that a hedgehog lived there. The boy did so, but, 
feeling the snake, with great presence of mind, he seized it firmly by the neck 
and flung it away from him. The snake fell on the doctor and bit him so severely 
that he died. The boys were brought before the king and charged, but on hearing 
the Bodhisatta’s explanation the king released them.</p>
<p>The story was related to show how the 
Bodhisatta practised paññāpāramitā. Ānanda is identified with the king.
