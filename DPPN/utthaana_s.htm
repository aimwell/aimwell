<p>The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was once staying in the upper 
storey of the <a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">Migāramātupāsāda</a> when he heard the new entrants to the Order, in 
the cells below, making a great uproar, talking about the food they had eaten, 
and other such worldly topics. The Buddha desired 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> to come and, when 
he appeared, the Buddha asked him to frighten the monks by a display of 
iddhi-power.</p>
<p>By his psychic power Moggallāna caused 
the whole building to rock to and fro like a ship, and when the monks, in 
terror, sought the Buddha’s protection, he explained to them that Moggallāna 
gave them the fright as a lesson to them to lead active and energetic lives, for 
death lays hold of the slothful.</p>
<p>The monks having listened to the 
Buddha’s sermon, concentrated their minds on it, and soon after became arahants.
