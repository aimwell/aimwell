  <h2>Gandhavamsa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A late Pali work written in Burma.  </p>
<p>It 
relates, in brief, the history of the Pāli Canon and gives accounts of 
post-canonical Pali books written in Burma and Ceylon.  </p>
<p>The colophon states that 
the work was composed by a forest-dwelling Elder named Nandapañña. At the end of 
each chapter the work is referred to as Cullagandhavamsa; perhaps what we have 
now is an abridged edition of a larger work.  </p>
<p>The work is published in J.P.T.S., 
1886, pp.55-80.</p>
