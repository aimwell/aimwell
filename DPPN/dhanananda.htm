<p>The youngest of the nine Nandas, sons of 
Kālāsoka. He was killed by Cānakka, who raised Candagutta to the throne 
(Mhv.v.17). He incurred Cānakka’s wrath by insulting him in the alms-hall. 
Cānakka stole his son Pabbata, put him to death, adopted Candagutta as his 
protégé, and stole DhanĀnanda’s treasures which he had discovered. With the 
money thus obtained he raised an army for Candagutta and defeated DhanĀnanda.
