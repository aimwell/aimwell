<p>1. Apannaka Sutta.-Preached to a 
gathering of brahmins in Sālā. On informing the Buddha that they had no favorite 
teacher in whom they had confidence, they were told that they should embrace and 
fulfill the Sound Doctrine (apannaka-dhamma), and the Buddha proceeded to 
explain it. In the course of this elucidation reference is made to the teachings 
of several other schools of thought, particularly those of the Jainas and the 
Ājīvakas, including the six Environments of life (abhijāti). For a discussion of 
some of these see Further Dial. i.293, n.1.</p>
<p>The sutta concludes with the 
arahant-ideal as the height to be attained by the being who tortures neither 
himself nor others, and who is given to torturing neither himself nor others, 
but lives here and now beyond all appetites, blissful and perfected.</p>
<p>M.i.400-13. For a derivation of the name 
see Weber: Ind. Str. iii.150, and Kuhn: Beitr., where the word is derived from 
a-prasna-ka. Buddhaghosa defines it as aviruddha advejjhagāmi ekasangāhiko 
(MA.ii.630).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Apannaka Sutta.-As sure as the cast 
of a true die (apannakamani) are the results of failures or successes of sīla, 
etc. A.i.270.</p>
<hr>
<p>1. Apannaka Vagga.-The eighth chapter of 
the Catukka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya. It consists of ten suttas on various 
topics, including an extract from the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta and a sutta 
containing reasons why women are excluded from public assemblies and serious 
business. A.ii.76-53.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Apannaka Vagga.-The first section of 
the Ekanipāta of the Jātakatthakatthā. J.i.95-142.</p>
