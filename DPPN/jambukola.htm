<p>A sea-port in Nāgadīpa in the north of 
Ceylon. Here Mahārittha and his companions embarked on their journey as envoys 
to <a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Dhammāsoka</a> (Mhv.xi.23). Here also arrived the ship conveying 
<a href="sanghamitta_theri.htm" title="sa/sanghamitta_theri.htm">Sanghamittā</a> and 
the branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree, welcomed by 
<a href="devaanampiyatissa.htm" title="d/devaanampiyatissa.htm">Devānampiyatissa</a>, who awaited 
her arrival in the Samuddapannasālā (Mhv.xix.25f). A sapling from the Bodhi-tree 
was afterwards planted on the spot where it had stood after landing (Mhv.vs.59; 
Sp.i.100; Mbv.145-62, passim) and Devānampiyatissa built a vihāra there called 
the Jambukolavihāra (Mhv.xx.25). From Jambukola to Tāmalitti by sea was a seven 
days' voyage (Mhv.xi.23), and it appears to have taken five days to get to 
<a href="anuraadhapura.htm" title="ay/anuraadhapura.htm">Anurādhapura</a> from Jambukola (Mhv.vs.38). It was the seaport of Anurādhapura 
(E.g., VibhA.446).</p>
<p>Geiger thinks (Cv. Trs.i.293, n.1; see 
Cv.lxx.72; lxxii.136) that, besides the seaport, there was another locality in 
the interior of Ceylon bearing the same name, which he identifies with the 
modern Dambulla.</p>
