<p>A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.69; ApA.i.106), 
third among the five hundred sons of Padumavatī, all of whom became Pacceka 
Buddhas. Suppabuddha, a banker of Rājagaha, having seen the Pacceka Buddha on 
his way to a park, spoke insultingly to him, and, as a result, was born as a 
leper in this birth. (Ud.v.3; UdA.291; DhA. (ii.36) says Suppabuddha spat on the 
Pacceka Buddha).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikaya (i.92f; SA.i.126f; 
also J.iii.299f and MT.597) contains the story of a man who often met 
Tagarasikhī begging for alms. One day, being attracted by him, he asked his wife 
to give him a meal and went on his way. His wife prepared excellent food and 
gave it to Tagarasikhī. The husband met Tagarasikhī on his way back to the town, 
and seeing the excellence of the food, was displeased with his wife’s 
generosity, thinking to himself that it were better that slaves and workmen 
should have eaten the food. As a result, he was born as a very rich setthi in 
Sāvatthi, but was never able to enjoy his wealth, and died intestate, all his 
possessions passing to the royal treasury. </p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.77f) calls 
him Aputtaka. It has been suggested (Bud. India, p.31) that the “Tagara” in 
Tagarasikhī was the name of a place, perhaps the modern Ter.</p>
