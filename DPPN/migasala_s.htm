<p>Ānanda visits Migasālā in her home and is questioned as to 
why both Pūrana and Isidatta, the former of whom was a brahmacārī and the latter 
not, should both have been born in Tusita, as sakadāgāmins. Ānanda offers no 
explanation, but consults the Buddha, who declares that Migasālā is but a 
foolish, frail, motherly body with none but mother wit; how, then, could she 
understand the diversity in the person of man? (purisa-puggala-paropariyañāna). 
The Buddha then goes on to divide men into six classes according to their 
capabilities and attainments. It is not possible for anyone, save a Tathāgata, 
to measure persons. A.iii.347ff.; v. 137ff.</p>
