<blockquote>
  <h2>Mahānāma Sutta 1 — 7</h2>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">Mahānāma the Sākyan visits the 
  Buddha at Nīgrodhārāma and confesses his worry as to where he would be reborn 
  if he were to meet with an accident while passing through the crowded streets 
  of Kapilavatthu! The Buddha assures him that he need not distress himself as 
  he has for long practised faith and virtue, learning, renunciation and 
  insight. His mind will soar aloft like a jar of butter or of oil, broken in a 
  deep pool of water, where the fragments of the jar will sink but the butter 
  and the oil float. S.v.370.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">The circumstances are similar to 
  those of the above sutta. The noble disciple, possessed of unwavering loyalty 
  to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who cultivates virtues dear to 
  the Ariyans, such a one is destined to Nibbāna. Mahānāma is such a one. 
  S.v.371; 404.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">See Godha Sutta.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">Mahānāma asks the Buddha, at 
  Nigrodhārāma, as to how a man becomes a disciple, how virtuous and a believer, 
  how far is he given to generosity and blessed with insight? The Buddha answers 
  his questions. S.v.395f.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">The Buddha tells Mahānāma, in 
  answer to his question, that the noble disciple who has won the fruit (āgataphala) 
  and grasped the teaching (viññātasāsana), lives a life of abundance, his mind 
  occupied with thoughts of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, the virtues 
  he practises, his liberality and the devas. Thus among uneven folk he lives 
  evenly and untroubled. A.iii.284ff.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">On six qualities which are 
  developed in a monk who is faithful, energetic, mindful, concentrated and 
  wise. His thoughts dwell on the Tathāgata, the Dhamma and the Sangha, on his 
  own generosity and on the devas. Thus his mind is free from thoughts of ill 
  will, lust, folly; it is direct, And he realises the attha and dhamma and the 
  joy associated with dhamma; his body is serene and his mind filled with joy. 
  A.v.328ff.; cp. No. 5 above.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 8">Very similar to sutta No. 6. 
  A.v.332ff.</li>
