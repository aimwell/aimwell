<h4>1. Nandiya Thera</h4>
<p>He belonged to a Sākiyan family of Kapilavatthu, and was 
called Nandiya because his birth brought bliss. He left the world at the same 
time as Anuruddha, Kimbila and the others, and he soon attained arahantship. 
Thereafter he dwelt with his companions in the Pācīnavamsamigadāya (Vin.i.350f. 
It was to them that the Upakkilesa Sutta was preached, M.iii.155. Later, they 
seem to have lived in the Gosingasālavana, M.i.205). It is said that Mars 
appeared before him in a terrible form, but Nandiya drove him away.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Nandiya built an altar 
of sandalwood at the Buddha’s cetiya and held great celebrations. Fifteen kappas 
ago Nandiya was eight times born as king under the name of Samatta (Samagga) 
(Thag.25; ThagA.82f.) He is probably identical with Saparivāriya (q.v.) of the 
Apadāna (i.172).</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvastu (iii.177) Nandiya (Nandika) was 
the son of Sukrodana.</p>
<p>He was a special friend of Kimbila. ThagA.i.276.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nandiya</h4>
<p>A Sakyan layman, evidently to be distinguished from the 
above. He visited the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu and had a 
discussion with him on the different kinds of Ariyan disciple, the one who 
dwells in remissness and the one who is earnest (S.v.397ff.; see also p. 403). 
Later, when the Buddha returned to Sāvatthi for the rainy season, Nandiya also 
went there, finding some business to do, and from time to time he visited the 
Buddha. At the end of the rains, when the Buddha and the monks were about to 
start on tour, Nandiya went to the Buddha and was taught the eleven conditions 
which lead to the destruction of evil. A.v.334ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nandiya</h4>
<p>A householder of Benarea. He was very pious and looked 
after his parents. When they wished him to marry Revatī, he refused because she 
belonged to a family of unbelievers. But when Revatī offered to help Nandiya in 
all his work, he agreed and they were married. When Nandiya’s parents died, 
leaving him very rich, he used the money to feed the poor and needy. Later he 
built a quadruple hall in the great monastery at Isipatana and furnished it with 
great splendour. On the day of its dedication to the Buddha and the monks, as 
the water of donation fell on the Buddha’s hand, there arose in Tāvatimsa a 
celestial mansion, measuring twelve leagues in each direction, for Nandiya’s 
use. During one of Moggallāna’s visits to Tāvatimsa he saw this mansion, and was 
told by many nymphs that they were awaiting Nandiya’s arrival (DhA.iii.290ff). 
The Vimāna Vatthu Commentary (VvA.222f ) goes on to say that after a life 
devoted to good deeds Nandiya died, and was born in his celestial mansion, and 
that Revatī, on the death of her husband, stopped the gifts of alms, abused the 
monks, and was cast alive into the Ussada niraya by the orders of Vessavana.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nandiya</h4>
<p>A Paribbājaka who visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks 
him the conditions for the attainment of nibbana. The Buddha teaches him the 
Noble Eightfold Path. S.v.11.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nandiya</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a monkey. For his story see the 
Cūla Nandiya Jātaka (J.ii.199ff.). He is also called Mahā Nandiya to distinguish 
him from his brother.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="6">6</a>. Nandiya</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a deer. See the <a href="nandiyamiga_jat_385.htm" title="n/nandiyamiga_jat_385.htm">Nandiyamiga Jātaka</a>. 
J.iii.270ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Nandiya</h4>
<p>A king of sixteen kappas ago; a former birth of 
Tilamutthidāyaka. Ap.i.235</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Nandiya Sutta</h4>
<p>The Paribbājaka Nandiya (see Nandiya 4) visits the Buddha 
and is instructed in the Noble Eightfold Path. S.v.11.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nandiya Sutta</h4>
<p>The Sākiyan Nandiya (Nandiya 2) visits the Buddha and 
learns the difference between the Ariyan disciple who is remise and the one who 
is earnest. S.v.397ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nandiya Sutta</h4>
<p>Nandiya, the Sākiyan, is taught by the Buddha hat the 
Ariyan disciple who is possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma 
and the Sangha, and who has the Ariyan qualities, is bound for enlightenment. 
S.v.403.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nandiya Sutta</h4>
<p>Relates the visit of Nandiya, the Sākyan (Nandiya 2) to 
Sāvatthi, to be near the Buddha, and the instruction he receives from the Buddha 
at the end of the rainy season. A.v.334ff.</p>
