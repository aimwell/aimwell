  <h2>Alāta</h2>

</ul>
<p>A minister and general of Angati, King 
of Videha. He is described as wise, smiling, a father of sons and full of 
experience. When Angati consulted his ministers as to ways and means of finding 
diversion for himself and his subjects, Alāta’s counsel was that they should set 
out to battle with a countless host of men. The suggestion of another minister, 
Vijaya, was that the king should visit some samana or brahmin, and this idea it 
was that won the king’s approval. Thereupon Alāta persuaded Angati to visit the 
Ājīvika Guna of the Kassapa family, who evidently enjoyed Alāta’s patronage. 
When Guna preached his doctrine that good and evil actions were alike fruitless, 
he was supported by Alāta, who stated that in a previous birth he had been 
Pingala, a cowkilling huntsman in Benares, and that he had committed many sins 
for which, however, he had never suffered any evil consequences.</p>
<p>Later, Angati’s daughter Rujā explains 
that Alāta’s present prosperity is the result of certain past acts of 
righteousness and that time will eventually bring him suffering on account of 
his evil deeds. Alāta himself, she says, is not aware of this because he can 
remember only one previous birth, while she herself can recall seven. See the 
Mahā Nārada-Kasappa Jātaka (J.vi.222ff).</p>
<p>Alāta was a previous birth of Devadatta 
(J.vi.255).</p>
<p>In the text he is sometimes (E.g., 
pp.221, 230) also called Alātaka, perhaps for the purposes of metre.</p>
