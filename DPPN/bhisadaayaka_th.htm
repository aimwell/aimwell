<p><b>1. Bhisadāyaka Thera.</b> An arahant. In the past, 
  while gathering lotus stalks for food, he saw Padumuttara Buddha travelling 
  through the air and asked him to accept some stalks. The Buddha did so. Soon 
  after, the man was struck by lightning and reborn in Tusita (Ap.ii.420f).
  He is probably identical with Bhaddaji Thera. ThagA.i.286.</p>

<p><b>2. Bhisadāyaka Thera.</b> An arahant. Thirty one 
  kappas ago he was an elephant, and seeing Vessabhū Buddha in the forest, he 
  gave him lotus stalks to eat. Thirteen kappas ago he was born sixteen times as 
  king under the name of Samodhāna. Ap.i.114.</p>
