<p><b>2. Amara.</b>-A city in the time of 
Siddhattha Buddha. The Buddha, being there, made his way to the pleasaunce (Amaruyyāna) 
of the city, leaving his footprints to show his path. The two chiefs of the 
city, Sambahula and Sumitta, brothers, seeing the footmarks, went themselves to 
the pleasaunce, and having listened to the Buddha’s preaching became arahants 
(BuA.186).</p>
