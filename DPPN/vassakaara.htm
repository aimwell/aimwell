<p>A brahmin, chief minister of <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>. He and
<a href="sunidha.htm" title="s/sunidha.htm">Sunidha</a> 
were in charge of the fortifications of <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaligāma</a>, built against the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajjī</a>. 
(Vin.i.228; Ud.viii.6; the Dīgha account, D.ii.72ff. omits Sunidha. The Vinaya 
account omits Vassakāra’s questions to the Buddha; cf. AA.ii.705ff).</p>
<p>At Ajātasattu’s suggestion, Vassakāra visited the Buddha 
to discover, indirectly, whether, in the Buddha’s view, there were any chances 
of Ajātasattu conquering the Vajjians in battle. The Buddha said that as long as 
the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught 
them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline, and this gave 
Vassakāra the idea that the downfall of the Vajjians could be brought about by 
diplomacy (upalāpana) or disunion (mithubheda). He thereupon conspired with the 
king (D.A.ii.522ff ) and, by agreement, the latter expelled him on the charge of 
showing favour to the Vajjians during discussions in the assembly. Vassakāra 
then went to the Vajjian country, and the Licchavis, all unsuspecting, welcomed 
him and appointed him as the teacher of their children. By means of cunning and 
questioning the children in secret, he made them quarrel with each other, and 
these quarrels soon spread to the elders. In three years the Licchavis were 
completely disunited, and when the assembly drum was beaten, they failed to 
appear. Vassakāra then sent a message to Ajātasattu, who was able to capture 
Vesāli without meeting any resistance.</p>
<p>In the <a href="gopaka_mogga.htm" title="g/gopaka_mogga.htm">Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta</a> (M.iii.8ff), Vassakāra is 
represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna 
was holding with Ānanda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, 
which were in charge of Moggallāna. Having asked the subject of conversation, he 
inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the 
Sangha after the Buddha’s death. Ānanda explains that the Buddha did not do so, 
that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom 
they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassakāra 
admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present. 
Vassakāra asks Ānanda where he lives, and is told, in 
<a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a>. Vassakāra thinks 
this a good place for the practice of jhāna, and tells Ānanda of a conversation 
he once had with the Buddha regarding jhāna. Ānanda, remarks that all jhānas are 
not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.854) that Vassakāra knew well of 
Ānanda’s residence at Veluvana, but that as the place was under his special 
protection, he wished to hear his work praised. Then follows a curious tale. 
Vassakāra once saw <a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> descending
<a href="gijjhakuuta.htm" title="g/gijjhakuuta.htm">Gijjhakūta</a> and remarked that he was 
just like a monkey. The Buddha, hearing of this, said that, unless Vassakāra 
begged the Elder’s forgiveness, he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana. 
Vassakāra, feeling sure that the Buddha’s prophecy would come true, had various 
fruit and other trees planted in Veluvana, to be of use to him as a monkey. 
After death he was actually reborn as a monkey and answered to the name of 
Vassakāra.</p>
<p>Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are 
recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veluvana. See 
<a href="vassakaara_sutta.htm" title="va/vassakaara_sutta.htm">Vassakāra Suttas</a> (1) and (2), and Suta Sutta 
??. Another Sutta, also called Vassakāra (3), repeats the conversation recorded in the Dīgha regarding the 
possibility of Ajātasattu defeating the Vajjians.</p>
<p>Vassakāra had a daughter whom he wished to give in 
marriage to <a href="uttara.htm" title="u/uttara.htm">Uttara</a>, but the latter refused the proposal as he wished to join the 
Order. Vassakāra was angry, and contrived to take his revenge even after Uttara 
had become a monk (ThagA.i.240; see Uttara).  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.ii.295) that Vassakāra was envious by nature, and, on discovering that a certain forest 
official had given tribute to <a href="dhaniya.htm" title="d/dhaniya.htm">Dhaniya</a> (2) without the king’s special leave, he 
reported the man to the king and had him punished (The incident is repeated at 
Vin.iii.42ff). In this context we find that Vassakāra was Mahāmatta (? prime 
minister) to <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> as well.</p>
