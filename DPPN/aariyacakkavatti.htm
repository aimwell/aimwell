<p>A Damila general who came with a large 
army from the Pandu kingdom and landed in Ceylon during the famine in the reign 
of Bhuvanekabāhu I. We are told that though he was no “Ariya” he was a dignitary 
of great power. He laid waste the kingdom and entered the capital Subhagiri. 
There he seized the Tooth Relic and the costly treasures which were kept with it 
and took them back to King Kulasekhara.</p>
<p>Cv.xc.43-7. Kulasekhara reigned 
1268-1308. His general Āriyacakkavatti is mentioned in a South Indian 
Inscription (No. 110, in the Annual Report of Epigraphy, Southern Circle, 
Madras, 1903).</p>
