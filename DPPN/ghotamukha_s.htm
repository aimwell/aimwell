<p>Records a conversation between Udena 
Thera and Ghotamukha at Khemiyambavana, after the Buddha’s death. Ghotamukha 
maintains that there is a Recluse who might be called Righteous (dhammiko 
paribbājo). Does Udena know of him? Udena describes to him the four types of 
individuals — those who torture themselves, those who torture others, those who 
torture both and those who torture neither, the last being those who live beyond 
appetites, consummate, unfevered and blissful. They want none of the things 
after which men hanker, but discarding them all go forth to homelessness. 
Ghotamukha admits that such are Righteous Recluses. M.ii.157ff</p>
