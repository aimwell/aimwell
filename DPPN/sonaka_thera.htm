  <h2>Sonaka Thera</h2>

<p>He was the son of a leader of a caravan of K훮si, and once, 
when he was fifteen, he went with his parents to R훮jagaha and then into the 
Veluvana vih훮ra. He had with him fifty five companions. He saw D훮saka Thera, 
and, very pleased with him, he entered the Order, after starving for three 
meals, until his parents gave their consent. He soon became an arahant and 
leader of one thousand monks. Later, as Sonaka sat in a trance, he was seen by 
Siggava and Candavaggi, who spoke to him. But he would not answer, and when they 
heard his explanation, they entered the Order under him. Mhv.v.104, 114ff.; 
Dpv.iv.39f.; v.79f.; Sp.i.32, 235; Vin.v.2.</p>
