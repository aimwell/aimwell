  <h2>Kinti Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Baliharana in Kusin훮r훮. The 
Buddha tells the monks that they should school themselves in the higher lore 
taught by him, such as the satipatth훮na, iddhip훮da, etc., and lays down rules on 
the treatment of monks who dispute about the meaning and letter of the Doctrine 
and of those who are guilty of transgressions. The sutta derives its name from 
the first words (kinti) uttered by the Buddha in beginning the sermon.
