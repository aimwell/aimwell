<p>A general of Dutthagāmanī. He was the son of Vasabha, a 
householder of Kutumbiyangana in Girijanapada. When the child was born, two 
friends of Vasabha, Vela and Sumana, came with gifts, and the boy was given 
their two names. When Velusumana grew up, he went to live with Sumana, governor 
of Girijanapada, and broke in a horse with which everyone else had failed. 
Sumana therefore gave him one hundred thousand and sent him to Kākavannatissa’s 
court (Mhv.xxiii.68ff).</p>
<p>When Vihāradevī wished to drink water in which had been 
washed the sword which cut off the head of Nandasārathi, Elāra’s chief warrior, 
Velusumana was entrusted with the task of killing Nandasārathi. He therefore 
went to Anurādhapura, where he became friendly with the keeper of the king’s 
state horse, Vāha. One day he took the horse to bathe in the Kadambanadī, and, 
after announcing his name, rode away on him. Elarā sent Nandasārathi in pursuit. 
Velusumana stood concealed behind a thicket, on a mound called Nigrodhasāla, 
with drawn sword, and as Nandasārathi rode past quickly, he was transfixed by 
Velusumana’s sword (Mhv.xxii.51ff.; MT. 440f).</p>
<p>Velusumana took a prominent part in the capture of 
Vijitapura (Mhv.xxv.25).
