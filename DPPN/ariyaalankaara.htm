<p>There were four theras of this name in 
Burma, all famous for their Pāli scholarship. The first (Ariyālankāra of Ava) 
excelled in dhātupaccayavibhāga, i.e. was an accomplished grammarian 
(Sās.p.106-12). His pupil, Ariyālankara the younger, is credited with exegetical 
works on the Atthasālinī, the Sankhepavannanā, the Abhidhammatthavibhāvanī and 
the Vibhanga. He also wrote a Pāli tika called the Sāratthavikāsinī on the 
Kaccāyanabheda, and he made in Burmese what amounted to a revised edition of 
Kaccāyana’s grammar (Sās.p.110-11; Bode, op. cit., 52-3).</p>
<p>The two others do not seem to have 
written any works which have been preserved.</p>
