<h3>Anattalakhana Sutta</h3>
<p>Preached five days after the 
<a href="dhammacakkappavattana.htm" title="d/dhammacakkappavattana.htm">Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta</a> to the
<a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiya</a> monks, all of whom became 
arahants at the conclusion of the sermon (Vin.i.13-14; J.i.82; iv.180; Dpv.i.34; 
MA.i.390; AA.i.57, 84). </p>
<p>No self is to be found in any of the 
five khandhas, all of which are impermanent and subject to woe. </p>
<p>The sutta does not deal with the 
question as to whether the self exists or not; it only shows that the khandhas 
are not the self.</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya (iii.66f ) the 
discourse is called the Pañca Sutta, the five referred to being the Pañcavaggīyā 
who listened to it.</p>

<h3>Anattalakhana Vatthu</h3>
<p>The story of five hundred monks. The 
Buddha, knowing their past, advises them to reflect on the “selfishness” of the 
khandhas (DhA.iii. 406-7). </p>
<p>These monks had devoted themselves to 
meditation on this topic for 20,000 years in the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha.</p>
