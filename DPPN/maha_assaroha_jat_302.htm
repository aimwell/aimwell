  <h2>Mahā Assāroha Jātaka (No. 302)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares, and having been 
defeated in some frontier disturbance, he fled on his horse till he reached a 
certain village. At sight of him all the people disappeared except one man, who 
made enquiries, and, on finding that he was no rebel, took him home and 
entertained him with great honour, looking well after his horse. When the king 
left, he told the man that his name was Mahā Assāroha, and asked him to visit 
his home if ever he should be in the city. On reaching the city himself, he gave 
orders to the gate keepers that if anyone should come enquiring for Mahā 
Assāroha, he should be brought at once to the palace. Time passed and the man 
failed to appear. The king, therefore, constantly increased the taxes of the 
village, until the villagers asked their neighbour to visit his friend Mahā 
Assāroha and try to obtain some relief. So he prepared presents for Mahā 
Assāroha and his wife, and taking a cake baked in his own house he set forth. 
Arrived at the city gates, he was conducted by the gate keeper to the palace. 
There the king accepted his presents, showed him all the honours due to a king, 
and, in the end, gave him half of his kingdom. When the ministers complained, 
through the medium of the king’s son, that a mere villager had been exalted to 
the rank of king, the Bodhisatta explained that real friends who help one in 
time of adversity should be paid every honour.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the good offices of 
Ānanda, who is identified with the villager. J.iii.8 13.</p>
