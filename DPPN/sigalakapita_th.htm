<p>He was a householder of Sāvatthi and had a son called 
Sigālaka. Later he entered the Order, and the Buddha asked him to meditate on 
the idea of a skeleton. He lived in the Bhesakalāvana in Sumsumāragiri, and 
there a woodland sprite once encouraged him with a verse (Thag.vs.18). Thus, 
urged to strive, he developed insight and became an arahant.</p>
<p>Ninety four kappas ago he had given a tāla fruit to the 
Pacceka Buddha Sataramsī. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk and 
developed meditation on the idea of a skeleton. ThagA.i.70f.</p>
