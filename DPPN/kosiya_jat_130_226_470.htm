<p><b>1. Kosiya Jātaka (No.130).</b>-A brahmin of 
Benares had a bad wife who lay in bed by day feigning sickness and spent her 
nights in enjoyment. The husband worked hard to supply her with dainties, and, 
in consequence, could not visit his teacher who was the Bodhisatta. When the 
latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of 
cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this 
medicine or get up and work. She then knew that her shamming was discovered and 
abandoned her evil ways.</p>
<p>The story was told to a brahmin of 
Sāvatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way. 
The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, 
for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the 
story (J.i.463f).</p>
<p>In the atītavatthu the woman is 
addressed as “Kosiyā.” The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the 
Kosiyagotta.</p>

<p><b>2. Kosiya Jātaka (No.226).</b>-The king of 
Benares, making war at an unseasonable time while camping in the park, saw an 
owl (kosiya) being attacked by crows. The king asked his minister the reason for 
this; the minister, being the Bodhisatta, said the owl had left his hiding-place 
too early-that is, before sunset.</p>
<p>The story was told to Pasenadi, who 
visited Jetavana on his way to quell a border rising; the time was unsuitable 
for such an enterprise. J.ii.208f.</p>
