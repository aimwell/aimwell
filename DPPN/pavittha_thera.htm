<p>A brahmin of Magadha who, following his own inclination, 
became a Paribbājaka. His training ended, he wandered forth and heard of 
Upatissa and Kolita joining the Buddha’s Order. Impressed by their example, he 
became a monk and, soon after, an arahant. In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he 
was an ascetic named Narādakesava and paid homage to the Buddha. Seventeen 
kappas ago he was a king named Amittatāpana (Thag.vs.87; ThagA.i.185f). 
</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Ekadamsaniya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.168f.</p>
