<p><b>1. Ekāsanadāyaka Thera.</b>-An arahant. In 
the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic named Nārada-Kassapa, living 
near the mountain Kosika. Once he saw the Buddha walking through the forest, and 
having provided him with a seat, spoke words in praise of him. The Buddha 
preached to him a short sermon. Fifty times Ekāsanadāyaka became king of the 
gods and eighty times he ruled over men. Wherever he wished he could find a 
seat, even in the forest or in a river (Ap.ii.381f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ekāsanadāyaka.</b>-A Thera. In the time 
of Padumuttara, he, with his wife, left the deva-world, and coming amongst men 
waited upon a monk named Devala (Ap.i.226).</p>
