<p>1. Sakalikā Sutta. Seven hundred devas of the Satullapa 
group visit the Buddha at Maddakucchi as he lay grievously hurt by a stone 
splinter. They express their admiration, in various ways, of the Buddha’s 
mindfulness and self possession and blame his enemy (Devadatta) for trying to 
injure so marvellous a being. S.i.27f.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Sakalikā Sutta. Māra approaches the Buddha at 
Maddakucchi as he lay there in great pain, and tries to grieve him by saying 
that he is idle and full of brooding thoughts. The Buddha denies the charge. 
S.i.110.</p>
