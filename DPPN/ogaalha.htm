  <h2>Ogālha or Kulagharanī Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A certain monk living in a forest tract 
in Kosala was held in very high esteem (ajjhogālhappatto) by a certain family. A 
deva of the forest, wishing to urge him to greater effort, went to the monk in 
the guise of the housewife (kulagharanī) of the family, and asked him why it was 
that people spent their time in endless talk. Was he not disturbed by it? The 
monk answered that a recluse should not be disturbed by other people’s talk 
(S.i.201). </p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.227) explains that 
the monk was already an arahant, but the devatā did not know it and could not 
therefore understand why he spent his time in visiting householders, hence her 
question wishing to make him live in solitude.</p>
