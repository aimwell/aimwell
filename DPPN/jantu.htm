<p>1. Jantu.-A devaputta. He saw a number 
of monks in a forest-lodge on the slopes of the Him캐laya, muddled in mind, loose 
of speech and heedless. He appeared before them on an uposatha day and reminded 
them of their duties. S.i.61f.</p>
<p>2. Jantu.-One of the five queens of 
Okk캐ka, founder of the third Okk캐ka dynasty. DA.i.258f; SNA.i.352f; 
MT.131.</p>
<p>3. Jantu.-Son of the third Okk캐ka, by a 
woman whom he appointed to be his chief queen when his first one, Hatth캐, died. 
This woman was promised a boon and she asked that her son Jantu be appointed to 
succeed Okk캐ka, in preference to his other children. Okk캐ka first refused but 
was obliged to yield. His other sons and daughters thereupon left the kingdom 
and became the founders of the S캐kiyan race (DA.258f; SNA.i.352f; MT.131).</p>
<p>The Mah竭astu (i.348) 
calls Jantu, Jent캐, and his mother Jent캶. He reigned in S캐keta.</p>
