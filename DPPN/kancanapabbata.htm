<p>1. Kañcanapabbata.-A mountain in Himavā 
(J.ii.396ff). It was near Kañcana-guhā, and on it grew the Abbhantaramba of 
Vessavana. On the mountain, in a hut, lived the ascetic Jotirasa, tending the 
sacred fire. The mountain formed one of the salient features of the Himālaya 
region (J.v.415). It is in the northern quarter of Himavā, and from its slopes 
flows the Sīdānadī (J.vi.101). In the Nimi Jātaka (J.vi.100) mention is made of 
two Kañcanapabbatā between which the Sīdānadī flows. The mountain is sometimes 
referred to as Kañcanagiri (E.g., UdA.411) and sometimes as Suvannapabbata 
(J.vi.100). The Buddha Sumana held his second assembly of disciples on the 
Kañcanapabbata, when ninety thousand crores of people were present (J.i.34).</p>
