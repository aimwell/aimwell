<p>King Sāma of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> had a state horse Pandava, whose trainer was the lame Giridanta. Observing that his trainer 
limped, the horse imitated him. When the king saw the horse limping, not being 
able to discover the reason, he asked his adviser, the Bodhisatta, to 
investigate the matter. The Bodhisatta reported that it was the result of evil 
association, and had the trainer replaced by another. The trainer was Devadatta 
(J.ii.98f).</p>
