<p>A village to the north of Samantakūta 
and on the road which led to it from the north. It is situated on a small river 
which joins the Maskeli river and ultimately flows into the Kelani river. 
Vijayabāhu I, built rest-houses at the village for the use of pilgrims coming to 
Samantakūta (Cv.lx.66).</p>
<p>Kadalī is to be identified with the 
modern Kehelgamuva (Cv.Trs.i.221, n.3).</p>
<p>Perhaps the Kadalisenagāma, where 
Devappatirāja built a bridge of one hundred staves, may be the same village, but 
this is questionable (Cv.lxxxvi.41). This is more likely to be the modern 
Kehellenāva (Cv.Trs.ii.174, n.3).</p>
