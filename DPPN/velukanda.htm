<p>A city in Avanti, birthplace of Nanda Kumāputta 
(ThagA.i.100). </p>
<p>Moggallāna and Sāriputta visited the place in the course 
of a journey in Dakkhināgiri and were entertained by Nandamātā (A.iv.62f). See 
Velukantakī. </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.717; SNA.i.370) that the city was 
so called because bamboos were thickly planted for protection round the walls 
and fortifications.</p>
