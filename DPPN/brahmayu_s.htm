  <h2>Brahmāyu Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Records the story of the conversion of Brahmāyu (q.v.).
</p>
<p>The Sutta contains a description of the thirty two marks 
of the Mahāpurisa (Cp. Lakkhana Sutta ) and also particulars of the Buddha's 
conduct in various circumstances <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; such as 
walking, eating, meditating, preaching, etc. That is an example of a sutta in 
which the word &quot;dhammacakkhu&quot; means the three Paths 
leading to anāgāmiphala. MA.ii.617.</p>
