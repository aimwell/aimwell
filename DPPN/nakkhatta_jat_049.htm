<p>Two parties, having arranged a marriage, fix a day for it 
to take place. The bridegroom’s party consults their family ascetic who, piqued 
at not having been asked before, declares that the chosen day is unlucky. The 
bride’s families, after waiting a while, give their daughter to another. When 
the first bridegroom comes later to claim her, he is charged with lack of common 
courtesy and a wrangle ensues, which is settled by a wise man who points out 
that all the trouble is due to the foolish habit of consulting stars.</p>
<p>The story is related in reference to two parties of 
Sāvatthi whose plans are similarly thwarted by a naked ascetic. The characters 
in both stories are the same, says the Buddha. J.i.257 ff.</p>
