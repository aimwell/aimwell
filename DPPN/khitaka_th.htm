<p>1. Khitaka Thera.-An arahant. He was 
born in a brahmin family in Sāvatthi, and having heard of the supernormal powers 
of Mahā Moggallāna entered the Order, wishing to attain to a like proficiency. 
He developed sixfold abhiññā and great supernormal powers.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a yakkha chief, and when he saw the Buddha and greeted him, the Buddha, to his 
great joy, preached to him. Eighty kappas ago he became king under the name of 
Sumangala (Thag.v.104; ThagA.i.209f). He is probably identical with Supāricariya 
of the Apadāna. Ap.i.181.</p>
<p>2. Khitaka Thera.-An arahant. He was 
born in a brahmin family of Kosala and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered 
the Order, in due course winning arahantship. Later he dwelt in the forest, 
stirring enthusiasm in the forest-dwelling monks.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a 
park-keeper, and having seen the Buddha going through the air offered him a 
coconut fruit, which the Buddha stopped to accept (Thag.vv.191-2; ThagA.315f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Nālikeradāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.447f). His Apadāna verses are also 
found under the name of Kundala Thera. ThagA.i.72.</p>
