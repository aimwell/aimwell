  <h2>Cakkavattisihan훮da Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached to the monks at <a href="m4_may.htm#Matula" title="ma/m4_may.htm#Matula">M훮tul훮</a>. It is a 
sermon on the necessity of living in accordance with the Dhamma, with the Dhamma 
as one s refuge.</p>
<p>The Sutta contains the story of the 
Cakkavatti <a href="dalhanemi.htm" title="d/dalhanemi.htm">Dalhanemi</a> and his eldest son, and the manner in which a 
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakka-vatti</a> 
administers the law, ruling by righteousness, over a people made virtuous by his 
instruction. But, later, there is a gradual corruption of morals, followed by 
the decay and destruction of human life with all its attendant comforts. This is 
followed by a gradual restoration of virtuousness, accompanied by the return of 
prosperity and longevity. </p>
<p>The Sutta also records the prophecy of 
the coming of the Buddha <a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteyya</a> (D.iii.58ff). It is said (DA.iii.858) that at 
the end of this discourse twenty thousand monks became arahants and eighty-four 
thousand others realised the Truth.</p>
