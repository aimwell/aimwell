<p>A Yakkha who lived in the Vepulla 
mountain outside Rājagaha. He was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya 
Sutta with a train of over one hundred thousand (D.ii.257). </p>
<p>He is called Rājagahika because he was 
born in Rājagaha (DA.ii.686). Sometimes (E.g., J.vi.272) he is spoken of as 
chief of the Kumbhandas. </p>
<p>When Bimbisāra wished to visit the 
courtesan Padumavatī at Ujjeni, the chaplain enlisted Kumbhīra’s assistance in 
transporting the king thither (ThigA.39).</p>
