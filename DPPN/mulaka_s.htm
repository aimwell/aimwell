  <h2>Mūlaka Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>The Buddha tells the monks that, should they be questioned 
by followers of other religions, they should answer that all things have desire 
(chanda) as their root. They originate in attention, they are caused by contact, 
their confluence is feeling, concentration is their chief state of all things, 
emancipation is the most precious. A.v.106f.= A.iv.338, where it is called Mūla 
Sutta.</p>
