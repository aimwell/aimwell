<p>An arahant. Ninety four kappas ago she was a kinnarā on 
the banks of the Candabhāgā, and, having seen the Buddha, offered him a garland 
of flowers. </p>
<p>She was queen of the devas thirty six times and queen 
among men in ten lives (Ap.ii.528f). </p>
<p>She is probably identical with Cittā Therī (ThigA.33f).</p>
