<p>A pavilion near the Karerikutikā, 
evidently a hall with a thatched roof supported by wooden pillars, but with no 
walls (D.ii.1; Dial.ii.5, n.2). Buddhaghosa calls it a nisīdanasālā 
(sitting-hall). Between this hall and the Gandhakuti was the Karerimandapa. 
Probably the term Karerimandalamālā was used to denote all the grounds within 
the Gandhakuti, the Karerikutikā and this hall (Gandhakuti pi Karerikutikā pi 
sālā pi Karerimandalamālo ti vuccati) (DA.ii.407). Dhammapāla, however, says 
that only the mandapa and the sālā were called Karerimandalamālā. He explains 
mandalamālā thus: tinapannacchadanam anovassakam mandalamālo; atimuttakādi 
latāmandapo ti apare (UdA.203). The monks seem to have been in the habit of 
sitting out here and talking on various topics at the close of the day. One such 
topic is recorded in the Udāna (Ud., p.30f), for discussing which the monks drew 
on themselves the Buddha’s stern rebuke.</p>
