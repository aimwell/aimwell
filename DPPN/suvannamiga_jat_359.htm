<p>The Bodhisatta was a young stag of golden colour who lived 
happily with a beautiful doe. The stag was the leader of eight myriads of deer. 
One day a hunter set a snare and the Bodhisatta’s foot got entangled therein. He 
gave a succession of warning cries and the herd fled. The doe, however, came up 
to him and encouraged him to try to break the noose. But all his efforts were in 
vain, and, when the hunter approached, the doe went up to him and asked to be 
allowed to die in her mate’s place. The hunter was so touched and amazed that he 
set them both free, and the stag gave him a magic jewel which he had found on 
the feeding ground.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a girl of Sāvatthi who 
belonged to a family devoted to the two Chief Disciples. She married an 
unbeliever, but was allowed to practise her own religion unmolested. She finally 
persuaded her husband to listen to a sermon by Sāriputta, and both husband and 
wife became sotāpannas. Later, they joined the Order and became arahants.</p>
<p>Channa (the husband) is identified with the hunter, while 
the woman was the doe. J.iii.182-7.</p>
