  <h2>Gandhamādana</h2>

</ul>
<p>A mountain range beyond the seven ranges 
of  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Cullakāla</li>
  <li>Mahākāla</li>
  <li>Nāgapalivethana</li>
  <li>Candagabbha</li>
  <li>Suriyagabbha</li>
  <li>Suvannapassa</li>
  <li><a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himavā</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is one of the five mountain ranges that encircle
<a href="anotatta.htm" title="ay/anotatta.htm">Anotatta</a>. It is 
crowned with a tableland, is green in colour (muggavanna), and covered with 
various medicinal plants. It shines from afar “like a glowing fire on a new-moon 
night.”  </p>
<p>In the range is an inclined slope (pabbhāra) named 
<a href="nandamulapabbhara.htm" title="n/nandamulapabbhara.htm">Nandamūlaka</a> 
containing three caves, Suvanna-, Mani- and Rajata-guhā, which are the abodes of 
Pacceka Buddhas.  </p>
<p>At the entrance to Maniguhā is a tree named Mañjūsaka, one 
league in height and in girth; on this tree bloom all the flowers that grow both 
on land and in water, and especially do they bloom on the occasions of the 
Pacceka Buddhas' visits; round the tree is the Sabbara-tanamāla.  </p>
<p>There the Sammajjanakavāta sweeps the ground, the Samakaranavāta levels the sand, and the 
Siñcanakavāta sprinkles water from Anotatta.  </p>
<p>The Sugandhakaranavāta brings all 
the perfumes of Himavā, the Ocinakavāta plucks flowers, and the Santharanakavāta 
spreads them.  </p>
<p>In the māla seats are always ready for the Pacceka Buddhas, who on 
fast days and on their own birthdays assemble there. When a new Pacceka Buddha 
arises in the world, he goes first to Gandha-mādana and other Pacceka Buddhas, 
who may be in the world, assemble there to greet him, and they all sit rapt in 
samādhi. Then the senior among them asks the new-comer to describe how he came 
to be a Pacceka Buddha (SNA.i.52, 66f; ii.437; AA.ii.759; UdA.300, etc.; 
MA.ii.585).  </p>
<p>The Pacceka Buddhas who live on Gandhamādana will often enter into 
samādhi for seven days, and at the end of that period seek alms from someone on 
whom they wish to bestow a special favour, that he may thereby obtain merit 
(E.g., DhA.iii.368f; iv.121, 199f; J.iv.16). These Buddhas will sometimes leave 
the mountain, and, having admonished those whom they wish to help, return again 
(E.g., J.iii.453).  </p>
<p>Besides Pacceka Buddhas, others are also mentioned as having 
resided in Gandhamādana — e.g., <a href="naarada.htm" title="n/naarada.htm">Nārada</a> (J.iv.393), 
<a href="n1_nan.htm#Nalinikaa" title="n/n1_nan.htm#Nalinikaa">Nalinikā</a> (J.v.186), 
<a href="b.htm" title="b/b.htm">Bahusodarī</a> (J.vi.83); also the deva king 
<a href="nagadatta.htm" title="n/nagadatta.htm">Nāgadatta</a> (ThagA.i.138), and 
<a href="vessantara.htm" title="vy/vessantara.htm">Vessantara</a>, 
with his family, after he renounced his kingdom (J.vi.528f.). It is also said 
that Kinnaras (J.iv.438) and Nāgas (Rockhill, 169) lived on the slopes of 
Gandhamādana. It was among the places visited by <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Khadira-vaniya Revata</a> 
(AA.i.139).</p>
<p>It is not explicitly mentioned that all 
Pacceka Buddhas die in Gandhamādana, but the inference seems to be such. Thus, 
once, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas led by <a href="mahapaduma.htm" title="maha/mahapaduma.htm">Mahāpaduma</a> died there, and their 
bodies were cremated (ThagA.ii.141).</p>
<p>The Jātaka Commentary (vi.79) explains 
Gandhamādana as gandhena mada-karo pabbato.</p>
<p>The fragrant tree Bhujaka grows only in 
heaven and in Gandhamādana (VvA.162).</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha <a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteya</a> will 
retire for a while to Gandhamādanā, after spending his first rainy season (Anāgatavamsa 
v.81).</p>
