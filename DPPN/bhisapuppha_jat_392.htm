<p>The Bodhisatta was born once as an ascetic, and one day a 
goddess, having seen him smell a lotus in bloom, upbraided him, telling him he 
was a thief to smell a lotus which did not belong to him. Near by was a man 
digging up lotus plants for their fibres, but to him the goddess said nothing. 
When questioned, her answer was that in a man like the Bodhisatta, seeking for 
purity, a sin even as large as a hair tip showed like a dark, cloud in the sky. 
The Bodhisatta, greatly impressed, thanked her.</p>
<p>The goddess is identified with Uppalavannā.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who was 
upbraided by a deity in a forest tract in Kosala for smelling a lotus. In great 
agitation, he went and consulted the Buddha, who told him the above story. 
J.iv.307ff.</p>
