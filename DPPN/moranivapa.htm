<p>A grove in Veluvana at Rājagaha. It contained a 
Paribbājakārāma, the resort of recluses of various denominations. The Udumbarikā 
Sīhanāda, the Mahā Sakuladāyi and the Culla Sakūladāyi Suttas were preached 
there (D.iii.36ff.; M.ii.1, 29).</p>
<p>The place was so called because peacocks were protected 
there and food was provided for them (DA.iii.835; MA.ii.694).</p>
<p>The Moranivāpa was on the bank of the Sumāgadhā and the 
Buddha is mentioned (D.iii.39) as walking there. Not far away was the park of 
the Queen Udumbarikā (D.iii.36). </p>
