<p>The Bodhisatta was once a minister of 
the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Noticing that the king was slothful, the Bodhisatta took a 
tortoise as an object lesson, showing him how the indolent came to misery.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk who was slothful regarding his duties. J.iii.139f.</p>
