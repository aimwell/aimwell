  <h2>Āmandagāmanī Abhaya</h2>

</ul>
<p>Son of Mahādāthika and King of Ceylon 
for nine years and eight months. His younger brother, by whom he was ultimately 
slain, was Kanirajānu-Tissa, and he had two children, a son Cūlābhaya and a 
daughter Sīvalī. Ilanāga was his nephew.</p>
<p>Āmandagāmani heightened the cone of the 
Mahā Thūpa and made additions to the Lohapāsāda and the Thūpārāma. He also built 
the Rajatalena Vihāra and the Mahāgāmendi tank to the south of Anurādhapura, 
which latter he gave for the use of the Dakkhinavihāra.  </p>
<p>He enacted an order that 
there should be no slaughter of animals in Ceylon and had gourds planted 
everywhere. To the whole brotherhood of monks in the island he once gave robes 
and alms-bowls filled with kumbhandaka fruits (pumpkins) and thereafter he was 
known by the name of Āmandagāmanī (Āmanda is evidently a synonym of Kumbhandaka).</p>
<p>His brother Kanirajānu-Tissa, having 
killed him, succeeded to the throne (Mhv.xxxv.1-10; MT.640). Āmandagāmanī is 
also referred to as Āmanda and Amandiya.</p>
