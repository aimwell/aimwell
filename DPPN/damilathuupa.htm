<p>A cetiya erected at Pulatthipura by 
Parakkamabāhu I. Its original name was the Mahā Thūpa, but it was renamed on 
account of its being built by the Damilas brought as captives from the Damila 
kingdom. Its circumference of one thousand three hundred cubits was larger than 
that of all other thūpas and, according to the Chronicle, it was built without 
the aid of any miraculous power. Cv.lxxviii.76ff.</p>
