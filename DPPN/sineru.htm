</ul>
<p>A mountain, forming the center of the world. It is 
submerged in the sea to a depth of eighty four thousand yojanas and rises above 
the surface to the same height. It is surrounded by seven mountain ranges -

<ol>
  <li>Yugandhara, </li>
  <li>Isadhara, </li>
  <li>Karavīka, </li>
  <li>Sudassana, </li>
  <li>Nemindhara, </li>
  <li>Vinataka and </li>
  <li>Assakanna </li>
</ol>
<p>(SNA.ii.443; Sp.i.119; Vsm.206; cp. Mtu.ii.300; Dvy.217; 
it is eighty thousand leagues broad, A.iv.100). </p>
<p>On the top of Sineru is <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> (SNA.ii.485f), while at 
its foot is the Asurabhavana of ten thousand leagues; in the middle are the four 
Mahādīpā with their two thousand smaller dīpā. (The Asurabhavana was not 
originally there, but sprang up by the power of the Asuras when they were thrown 
down from Tāvatimsa, DhA.i.272; see, e.g., SNA.i.201).</p>
<p>Sineru is often used in similes, its chief characteristic 
being its un-shakeability (sutthuthapita) (E.g., SN. vs.683). It is also called 
Meru or Sumeru (E.g., Cv.xlii.2), Hemameru (E.g., Cv.xxxii.79) and Mahāneru 
(M.i.338; also Neru, J.iii.247). </p>
<p>Each <a href="cakkavaala.htm" title="c/cakkavaala.htm">Cakkavāla</a> has its own Sineru (A.i.227; v.59), and a 
time comes when even Sineru is destroyed (S.iii.149). </p>
<p>When the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa, he covered the distance 
there from the earth in three strides he set his right foot down on the top of 
Yugandhara and his left on Sineru, the next step brought him to Tāvatimsa, the 
whole distance so covered being sixty eight hundred thousand leagues. 
DhA.iii.216.</p>
