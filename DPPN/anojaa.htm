<p>1. Anojā.-Wife of Mahākappina, while he 
was king, before he entered the Order. She had been his wife in former births as 
well and had helped him in his good works. In this age she was of equal birth 
with Mahākappina and became his chief consort. She was so called because her 
complexion was the colour of anoja-flowers.</p>
<p>When Kappina made his renunciation, she 
and her companions followed him in chariots, crossing rivers by an act of truth 
(saccakiriyā), saying “the Buddha could not have arisen only for the benefit of 
men, but for that of women as well.”</p>
<p>When she saw the Buddha and heard him 
preach, she and her companions became Stream-enterers. She was ordained by 
Uppalavannā (AA.i. pp.176ff. ; SA.ii., pp.178ff). In the Visuddhimagga it is 
said that Mahākappina was present when she heard the Buddha preach, but the 
Buddha contrived to make him invisible. When she asked whether the king was 
there, the Buddha’s reply was “Would you rather seek the king or the self?” “The 
self ” was the answer (p.393. The conversation on the “self” seems to have been 
borrowed from Vin.i.23.</p>
