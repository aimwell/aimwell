<p><b>1. Mucalinda. </b>A legendary king, descended from 
Mahāsammata. Mhv.ii.3; Dpv.iii.6; Mtu.i.348.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mucalinda</b></p>
<p>A tree near the Ajapālanigrodha in Uruvelā. The Buddha 
spent there the third week after the Enlightenment. There was a great shower of 
rain, and the Nāga king, Mucalinda, of the tree, sheltered the Buddha by winding 
his coils seven times round the Buddha’s body and holding his hood over the 
Buddha’s head (Vin.i.3; J.i.80; BuA.8, 241; Ud.ii.1; Mtn.iii.300, 302; DhSA.35).
</p>
<p>The Udāna Commentary (100f.; see also MA.i.385) adds that 
the space provided by the Nāga’s coils was as large as the floor space of the 
Lohapāsāda and that the Nāga king lived in a pond near the tree.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mucalinda. </b>A king of long ago. He is mentioned 
(J.vi.99) in a list of those who, in spite of having given great gifts, could 
not penetrate beyond the realms of sense. He is, perhaps, identical with 
Mucalinda (1), and probably also with Mujalinda (q.v.).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mucalinda.</b> A lake in 
Himavā, north of Nālicapabbata. Vessantara and his family passed it on their way 
to Vankagiri, which was near by (J.vi.518, 519, there is a description of it at 
J.vi.534 and again at 539).</p>
<p>It seems also to have been called Sumucalinda (E.g., 
J.vi.582). </p>
<p>Mucalinda is one of the great lakes of Himavā. D.i.164.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Mucalinda. </b>One of the chief Yakkhas to be 
invoked by the Buddha’s followers in time of need. D.iii.205.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Mucalinda. </b>A mountain. Ap.ii.536 (verse 86).</p>
