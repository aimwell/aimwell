<p>The Bodhisatta in one of his births. He 
was a brahmin magnate of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, who, after giving away all his wealth in 
charity, retired to the forest with his sister, <a href="yasavatii.htm" title="y/yasavatii.htm">Yasavatī</a>. When gifts were 
brought to him as homage to his holiness, he sought obscurity, and, leaving his 
sister, dwelt in Kāradīpa, then known as Ahidīpa, eating the leaves of a Kāra-tree 
sprinkled with water. By virtue of his asceticism Sakka’s throne was heated, and 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> (Anuruddha in a previous birth), having tested him, and being satisfied 
that worldly attainments were not his aim, granted him various boons, including 
one that Sakka should not visit him any more and disturb his asceticism! 
(J.iv.236f). </p>
<p>His story is given in the Cariyāpitaka 
(p.1), to illustrate dāna-paramitā. In the <a href="nimi_jat_541.htm">Nimi Jātaka</a> he is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (*), who, by their holy lives; passed the Peta world to be born 
in Brahma’s heaven. In the Jātaka-mālā (no.7) his name occurs as Agastya, but he 
should not be confused with the Vedic sage of that name (See Vedic Index). 
Perhaps he belonged to the Kassapagotta, because, in the conversation related in 
the Jātaka story, Sakka addresses him as “Kassapa.” (J.iv.240-1)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(*) J.vi.99, the others being the seven 
brothers Yāmahanu, Somayāga, Manojava, Samudda, Māgha, Bharata and 
Kālikarakkhiya; and Angīrasa, Kassapa and Kisavaccha. See also KhA.127f</p>
