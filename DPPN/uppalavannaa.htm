<p>1. Uppalavannā Therī.-One of the two 
chief women disciples of the Buddha. She was born in Sāvatthi as the daughter of 
a banker, and she received the name of Uppalavannā because her skin was the 
colour of the heart of the blue lotus. When she was come of age, kings and 
commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her father, asking for her 
hand. He, not wishing to offend any of them, suggested that Uppalavannā should 
leave the world. Because of her upanissaya, she very willingly agreed and was 
ordained a nun. Soon it came to her turn to perform certain services in the 
uposatha-hall. Lighting the lamp, she swept the room. Taking the flame of the 
lamp as her visible object, she developed tejokasina and, attaining to jhāna, 
became an arahant possessed of the four special attainments (patisambhidā). She 
became particularly versed in the mystic potency of transformation (iddhivikubbana). 
When the Buddha arrived at the Gandamba-tree to perform the Twin Miracle, 
Uppalavannā offered to perform certain miracles herself, if the Buddha would 
give his consent, but this he refused (ThigA.190, 195). Later, at Jetavana, in 
the assembly of the Sangha, he declared her to be the chief of the women 
possessed of iddhi-power (A.i.25). The Therīgāthā (vv.234-5) contains several 
verses attributed to her.</p>
<p>Three of them had been uttered in 
anguish by a mother who had been unwittingly living as her daughter’s rival with 
the man who later became the monk Gangātīriya (q.v.). Uppalavannā repeated them 
to help her to reflect on the harm and vileness of sensual desires. Two others 
are utterances of joy on the distinctions she had won and another records a 
miracle she performed before the Buddha, with his consent. The rest contain a 
conversation between Uppalavannā and Māra (a conversation, more or less 
identical with the foregoing, is recorded in S.i.131f), wherein she tells him 
that she has passed completely beyond his power.</p>
<p>The books give several episodes 
connected with Uppalavannā. Once a young man named Ānanda, who was her cousin 
and had been in love with her during her lay-life, hid himself in her hut in 
Andhavana and, in spite of her protestations, deprived her of her chastity. It 
is said that he was swallowed up by the fires of Avīcī. From that time onwards, 
nuns were forbidden to live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49f; the incident is referred 
to in Vin.iii.35). It is said (E.g., DhA.iv.166f) that this incident gave rise 
to the question whether even arahants enjoyed the pleasures of love and wished 
to gratify their passions. Why should they not? For they are not trees nor 
ant-hills, but living creatures with moist flesh. The Buddha most emphatically 
declared that thoughts of lust never entered the hearts of the saints. On 
another occasion, Uppalavannā came across, in Andhavana, some meat left behind, 
obviously for her, by some kind-hearted thief; having cooked the meat, she took 
it to the Buddha at Veluvana. Finding him away on his alms-rounds, she left the 
meat with Udāyi, who was looking after the vihāra, to be given to the Buddha, 
but Udāyi insisted on Uppalavannā giving him her inner robe as a reward for his 
services (Vin.iii.208f).</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary 
(iii.211), the miracle which Uppalavannā volunteered to perform at the Gandamba-tree, 
was the assumption of the form of a cakkavatti, with a retinue extending for 
thirty-six leagues and the paying of homage to the Buddha, with all the 
cakkavatti’s followers, in the presence of the multitude.</p>
<p>Mention is made of a pupil of 
Uppalavannā, who followed the Buddha for seven years, learning the Vinaya 
(Vin.ii.261).</p>
<p>The Buddha declares that Khemā and 
Uppalavannā are the measure of his women disciples, and that the believing nun, 
if she would aspire perfectly, should aspire to be like them (A.i.88; ii.164; 
S.ii.236).</p>
<p>In Padumuttara’s time Uppalavannā saw a 
woman disciple who was declared to be the best of those possessed of supernormal 
power, and wished for herself a similar rank in the dispensation of a future 
Buddha. In the time of Kassapa, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king 
of Benares, and having done many good deeds, was born in heaven. Later, she was 
born in the world of men and had to work for her own living. One day she gave to 
a Pacceka Buddha, who had just risen from samādhi, a meal of fried rice in his 
bowl and covered it with a beautiful lotus; the meal had been prepared for 
herself. The lotus she afterwards took back but again replaced it, asking the 
Pacceka Buddha’s forgiveness. She expressed a wish that she should beget as many 
sons as there were grains of rice in her gift, and that lotuses should spring up 
under her feet as she walked. In her next birth she was born in a lotus. An 
ascetic adopted her as his daughter, but when she grew up, the king of Benares, 
hearing of her beauty, asked the ascetic for her hand and made her his chief 
queen, under the name of Padumavatī. The king’s other wives were jealous of her 
beauty, and when the king was away, quelling a rising of the border tribes, they 
concealed in caskets the five hundred sons, chief of whom was the prince 
Mahāpaduma (q.v.), that were born to Padumavatī, and told the king that 
Padumavatī was a non-human and had given birth to a log of wood. Padumavatī was 
sent away in disgrace, but later, through the instrumentality of Sakka, the 
trick was exposed, and Padumavatī regained all her former power and glory. (Her 
temporary downfall was due to her having withdrawn her gift of a lotus to the 
Pacceka Buddha.) Later, when Mahāpaduma and his brothers became Pacceka Buddhas, 
Padumavatī died of a broken heart and was born in a village outside Rājagaha. 
There some of the Pacceka Buddhas who had been her sons discovered her, and they 
all came to a meal at her house. At the conclusion of the meal she offered them 
blue lotuses, and expressed the wish that her complexion should be like the 
matrix of the blue lotus. </p>
<p>This account is a summary of the 
Therīgāthā Commentary, pp.182ff; AA.i.188ff; but see also DhA.ii.48f.</p>
<p>The Apadāna account of the past lives of 
Uppakavanna differs from the above in several details (ii.551. But vv.1-15 
quoted in the ThigA. differ from those in the Apadāna, and agree with the ThigA. 
account). According to this account, in Padumuttara’s time she was a Nāga maiden 
named Vimalā and was impressed by the iddhi-powers displayed by a nun, hence her 
wish for similar powers. The Apadāna also mentions Uppalavannā’s birth as the 
daughter of a banker of Benares, in the time of Vipassī. She gave great alms to 
the Buddha and the monks and made offerings of lotuses. She was the second 
daughter of Kikī and her name was Samannaguttā. In her next birth she became the 
ravishing daughter of Tirītavaccha of Aritthapura. In her last birth she became 
an arahant within a fortnight of her ordination.</p>
<p>Uppalavannā’s name occurs several times 
in the Jātakas. In the Kharādiya Jātaka (J.i.160) she was a deer, the sister of 
the Bodhisatta; in the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.164) she was the mother of 
Rāhula, then born as a stag. She is identified with the old woman, the 
foster-mother of Ayyakālaka (J.i.196), with the queen Mudulakkhanā (J.i.306), 
the brahminee in the Sārambha (J.i.375), the courtesan in the Kurudhamma 
(J.ii.381), the brahmin’s daughter (and sister of Rāhula) in the Dhonasākha 
(J.iii.168), Siridevī in the Sirikālakanni (J.iii.264), the goddess in the 
Bhisapuppha (J.iii.310), Manoja’s sister in the Manoja (J.iii.324), the 
ascetic’s daughter in the Kumbhakāra (J.iii.383), the deity in the Jāgarajā 
(J.iii.405), in the Sankha (J.iv.22), and in the Kiñchanda (J.v.11), the sister 
in the Bhisa (J.iv.314), Sutanā in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423), the younger 
sister in the Jayaddisa (J.v.36), Kundalinī in the Tesakuna (J.v.125), Ummadantī 
in the Ummadantī (J.v.227), Hiridevatā in the Sudhābhojana (J.v.412), the 
goddess of the parasol in the Mūgapakkha (J.vi.29), the ocean spirit in the 
Mahājanaka (J.vi.68), the goddess in the Sāma (J.vi.95), Selā in the Khandahāla 
(J.vi.157), Accimukhī in the Bhūridatta (J.vi.219), Bherī in the Mahā-ummagga 
(J.vi.478) and Kanhajinā in the Vessantara (J.vi.593).</p>
<p>It was Uppalavannā who ordained Anojā 
and her companions, by the express wish of the Buddha (AA.i.178).</p>

<p>2. Uppalavannā.-One of the two daughters 
of Kassapa I. of Ceylon, the other being Bodhī. The king built a vihāra and
