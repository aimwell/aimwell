<p>Queen consort of Udena. She belonged to 
a poor merchant’s family in Telappanāli and had long and beautiful hair, the 
envy of her friends. One day, Mahā Kaccāna and seven others visited the village, 
and she sold her hair for eight kahāpanas, that she might provide the visitors 
with a meal. It is said that she recovered her hair immediately on seeing Mahā 
Kaccāna. When the Elder reached Ujjeni that very day, by air, he related the 
incident to King Udena and the king, having sent messengers to fetch Gopālamātā, 
made her his chief consort. She gave birth to a son, whom she called Gopāla, 
after her own father, and thenceforth she herself was called Gopālamātā.
