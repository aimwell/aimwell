    <h1>Kaniska</h1>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="GramE">The great KusÄna 
  king of India, a renowned patron of Buddhism. 
  His name is spelt as <span class="SpellE">KÄniska in inscriptions. On 
  coins it appears, in Greek script, as <span class="SpellE">KanÃ©rki, or 
  in the genitive <span class="SpellE">Kanerkou which some scholars read 
  as <span class="SpellE">KanÃ©shki and <span class="SpellE">KanÃ©shkou.
  <span class="SpellE">Kasmir tradition gives the variant
  <span class="SpellE">Kanistha which become <span class="SpellE">Kanit'a 
  in Chinese. <span class="SpellE">Alberuni refers to him as
  <span class="SpellE">Kanik<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></a>.</p>
  <p>There are different theories regarding 
  the nationality of Kaniska. It is widely accepted that he is of
  <span class="SpellE">Yuch-chi origin. It is said that during the 2nd 
  century B.C. the <span class="SpellE">Yuch-chi, a Mongoloid nomadic 
  tribe of Central Asia, was forced out of their pasture lands by their more 
  powerful neighbours, the <span class="SpellE">Hiung-nu. Being thus 
  driven out they migrated westwards and in the course of their migration 
  conquered the Wu sun tribe and settled down in the basin of the
  <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lli<span class="GramE"> 
  river. Here they were divided into two branches of which the minor 
  branch (<span class="SpellE">Siao-yueh-chi) deflected southwards and 
  settled down along the Tibetan border while the major branch (Ta-<span class="SpellE">yueh-chi) 
  proceeded forwards, defeated the <span class="SpellE">Sakas and settled 
  down in the conquered territory. From there they were again expelled by the 
  son of the dead Wu sun chieftain. Resuming their march, they finally occupied 
  Bactria and Sogdiana and by about the 1st century B.C. gave up their nomadic 
  habits and adopted a more settled life, Here they were divided into five 
  groups of whom the <span class="SpellE">KusÄnas (<span class="SpellE">Kueishuang) 
  overpowered the rest and united the whole tribe under Kadphises I (i.e.,
  <span class="SpellE">Kujula Kadphises) who captured some regions of 
  North West India. He was succeeded by his son Kadphises II (i.e.,
  <span class="SpellE">Wima Kadphises) who annexed further Indian
  <span class="GramE">territory. Kaniska, <span class="SpellE">whos 
  connection with Kadphises II is not known<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></a>, 
  is said to have succeeded him<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></a>.
  </p>
    <p>Sten <span class="SpellE">Konow 
  and Fleet consider that Kaniska belonged to a separate clan of the
  <span class="SpellE">KusÄnas which originated from Khotan<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></a>. 
  B.N. Puri<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]</a><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
  <![endif]><span class="GramE">says 
  that the KusÄna and the <span class="SpellE">Yueh-chi are two different 
  racial groups and that the former is of Iranian <span class="SpellE">Saka 
  stock while the latter is of Mongoloid origin.</div>
<div class="Section2">
    <p>There is no consensus among scholars 
  regarding the date of Kaniska. The earliest and the latest dates assigned to 
  his accession are 5 B.C. and 278 A.C. S Levi suggested 5 B.C.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></a> 
  Fleet who places it in 58 B.C. also considers him to be the founder of the
  <span class="SpellE">Vikrama <span class="SpellE">Samvat<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></a>. 
  According to Professor Van <span class="SpellE">Lohuizen de
  <span class="SpellE">Leeuw Kaniska acceded to the throne between 71-86 
  A.C.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></a> 
  Cunningham places him in 80 A.C.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></a>
  <span class="SpellE">Fergusson, <span class="SpellE">Oldenberg,
  <span class="SpellE">Rapson, Thomas, <span class="SpellE">Banerji,
  <span class="SpellE">Jayaswal, and later, even Marshal and Levi place 
  Kaniska in 78 A.C. and some of them regard him also as the founder of the
  <span class="SpellE">Saka era<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></a>. 
  Vincent Smith, Sten <span class="SpellE">Konow favours one of the two 
  dates 120 or 128-29 A.C.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></a>
  <span class="SpellE">Ghirshman suggests the date 144 A.C. which is 
  endorsed by Benjamin Rowland and B.N Puri<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></a>. 
  The date put forward by R.C. <span class="SpellE">Majumdar is 248 A.C.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></a> 
  D.R. <span class="SpellE">Bhandarkar first suggested 278 A.C. but later 
  adopted 128 A.C.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></a></p>
    <p>Of these numerous dates the most 
  widely accepted is 78 A.C. though some modern scholars like Benjamin Rowland 
  and B.N. Puri prefer the date 144 on the ground that the latest archaeological 
  discoveries made at <span class="SpellE">Begram in Afghanistan by
  <span class="SpellE">Ghrishman add more weight to it.</p>
    <p>The view put forward by Fleet, and 
  supported by R. Otto <span class="SpellE">Franke and J. Kennedy, that 
  Kaniska preceded the two Kadphises, is no longer held as valid<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></a>. 
  The excavation done at <span class="SpellE">Taxila has shown that the 
  coins of the Kaniska group of the KusÄna kings were found in the upper (i.e. 
  later) strata of earth while those of the Kadphises group were in the lower 
  (i.e., earlier) strata. The connection between Kadphises II and Kaniska is not 
  known. However, the evidence provided by the coin finds in which the coins of 
  Kadphises II and Kaniska were found together proves that they were close to 
  each other in time. It is plausible to hold that Kaniska succeeded Kadphises 
  II after a short interregnum<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></a>.</p>
    <p>It is quite certain that Kaniska 
  succeeded to a fairly large kingdom of Kadphises II. He expanded this kingdom 
  by annexing more territory both in India and in Central Asia. Inscriptions of 
  Kaniska found at <span class="SpellE">Kosam (Allahabad)<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></a><span class="GramE">,&nbsp;
  <span class="SpellE">Sarnath<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></a>, 
  Mathura<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[19]<![endif]></a>, 
  Sui-<span class="SpellE">vihar (<span class="SpellE">Bhavalpur)<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[20]<![endif]></a>,
  <span class="SpellE">Zeda (Und)<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[21]<![endif]></a>,
  <span class="SpellE">Manikiala (<span class="SpellE">Rawalpindj)<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[22]<![endif]></a> 
  and his coins, found in Bihar and PÄtaliputta, suggest that he ruled over a 
  vast Indian territory<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[23]<![endif]></a>.
  <span class="GramE">Chinese and Tibetan tradition record that he conquered 
  SÄketa and <span class="GramE">Magadha and 
  carried off the eminent Buddhist scholar <span class="SpellE">Asvaghosa<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[24]<![endif]></a>. 
  He also conquered Kashmir, Punjab and Sind. In Kashmir he erected numerous 
  monuments and founded a city called <span class="SpellE">Kaniskapura, 
  now represented by the village <span class="SpellE">Kanispor. Outside 
  India his rule extended to Afghanistan, Bactria, Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand.</p>
  <p>Though he seems to have cherished a 
  marked preference for Kashmir he had his capital at <span class="SpellE">
  Purusapura, the modern Peshawar which lay in the main route from 
  Afghanistan to the Indus plain.</p>
  <p>Kaniska was a renowned warrior. His 
  most daring military feat is his conquest of Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan, 
  which were dependencies of China, Kadphises II is also said to have tried to 
  accomplish this feat without success and consequently had to pay tribute to 
  China. Kaniska not only freed his kingdom from this obligation, but also took 
  away hostages from a dependency of China<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[25]<![endif]></a>. 
  Some scholars are of opinion that on a previous occasion Kaniska, too, tasted 
  defeat at the hands of the Chinese general Pan-<span class="SpellE">chao.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[26]<![endif]></a></p>
  <p><![if !supportFootnotes]><![endif]></p>
  <p>Kaniska treated his hostages with 
  utmost consideration, providing them with places of residence suitable for 
  each season. These hostages are said to have resided in the
  <span class="SpellE">Sha lo ka monastery probably situated in the hills 
  of <span class="SpellE">Kapisa (modern Kafiristan) and in monasteries 
  at <span class="SpellE">GandhÄra and Eastern Punjab (<span class="SpellE">Cinabhukti).<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[27]<![endif]></a></p>
  <p>Buddhist tradition describes Kaniska 
  as a great patron of Buddhism comparable to Asoka: Legends about his 
  conversion closely resemble those of Asoka, and it is probable that these 
  legends were based on stories detailing Asokaâ€™s conversion. Tradition 
  represents Kaniska, before his conversion to Buddhism, as one who had no faith 
  either in right or wrong and as a person who did not pay any attention to 
  Buddhism. It is also said that the immediate cause of his conversion was the 
  deep remorse he felt over the bloodshed in his numerous wars.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[28]<![endif]></a> 
  Though this tradition is based on facts it could be surmised that it was built 
  up by the Buddhists making Kaniska to emulate Asoka and show the ennobling 
  influence of Buddhism on him.</p>
    <p>Epigraphical and numismatic records do 
  not provide clear testimony regarding his conversion and religion. Vincent 
  Smith surmises<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[29]<![endif]></a> 
  that his coins show that his conversion to Buddhism did not take place until 
  he had been on the throne for some time. The finest and presumably the 
  earliest coins bear legends, Greek in both script and language, with images of 
  the sun and moon under the names Helios and Selene (spelt <span class="SpellE">
  SalÃ©nÃ© on the coins). On later issues, the Greek script is retained but 
  the language is <span class="SpellE">Knotanese, while the reverse of 
  the coins represents gods worshipped by Greeks, Persians and Indians.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[30]<![endif]></a> 
  The coins that bear the images of <span class="SpellE">SÄkyamuni are 
  considered to be the latest. Some Indian scholars think that if numismatic 
  evidence proves anything, it is only his eclecticism, or that his coins only 
  depict the various forms of faith prevailing in his vast empire.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[31]<![endif]></a> 
  Despite attempts to adduce evidence to prove that he was not a Buddhist, the 
  testimony provided by the numerous monuments he has built, as well as his 
  association with the Buddhist Council held during his reign show that, even if 
  he was not a Buddhist, he was more bent towards Buddhism than towards any 
  other religion. An inscription found on a relic casket, too, is taken by some 
  scholars as evidence to establish that he favoured the <span class="SpellE">
  SarvÄstivÄda school of Buddhism.<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[32]<![endif]></a></p>
  <p>Tradition records that Kaniska studied 
  Buddhism in his leisure hours under the guidance of <span class="SpellE">
  PÄrsva. Tradition also states that he carried off <span class="SpellE">
  Asvaghosa from <span class="SpellE">PÄtaliputra.<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[33]<![endif]></a> 
  Even if this story is not accepted it is plausible to hold that Kaniska and
  <span class="SpellE">Asvaghosa were contemporaries and that these two 
  were associates.</p>
    <p>Two eminent Buddhist scholars
  <span class="SpellE">Vasumitra and <span class="SpellE">NÄgÄrjuna 
  too, are said to be his contemporaries.<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[34]<![endif]></a> 
  Buddhism at that time was a force to reckon with, and despite the possibility 
  that Kaniska was doing his best to consolidate big vast empire; he adopted 
  Buddhism to keep abreast of the trends prevalent at the time.</p>
    <p>According to the Buddhist tradition 
  the greatest service rendered to Buddhism by Kaniska is his convening of the 
  Buddhist Council during his reign. There are different accounts of this 
  council. The best known is that of <span class="SpellE">
  <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hsuan-tsang</a>.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[35]<![endif]></a>
  <span class="SpellE">ParamÄrtha in his Life of <span class="SpellE">
  Vasubandhu gives another version which, though generally considered to 
  be the same as that of <span class="SpellE">Hsuan-tsang, contains 
  different information.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[36]<![endif]></a>
  <span class="SpellE">TÄrÄnÄtha also records an account, which, though 
  confused, contains important information. It is not relevant at present, to 
  extract facts from these legendary accounts which are confused and often 
  discrepant.</p>
    <p>It is said that Kaniska, greatly 
  puzzled by the conflicting teachings found in different schools, suggested to
  <span class="SpellE">PÄrsva to summon a council of eminent monks to 
  obtain an authoritative disposition of the doctrine. There was some difference 
  of opinion among them as to the venue of the council and they finally decided 
  to hold it at the <span class="SpellE">Kundalavana vihÄra in Kashmir.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[37]<![endif]></a>
  <span class="SpellE">Vasumitra was elected president with
  <span class="SpellE">Asvaghosa as the Vice president. The members, five 
  hundred in all composed 100,000 stanzas of <span class="SpellE">Upadesa
  <span class="SpellE">SÄstra explanatory of the canonical sutras, 
  100,000 stanzas of Vinaya <span class="SpellE">vibhÄsÄ
  <span class="SpellE">sastra explanatory of the <span class="SpellE">
  vinaya and 100,000 of <span class="SpellE">Abhidharma
  <span class="SpellE">vibhÄsÄ <span class="SpellE">sastra 
  explanatory of the <span class="SpellE">Abhidharma. Kaniska is said to 
  have caused these treatises to be written on copper plates and enclosed them 
  in stone boxes which he deposited in a <span class="SpellE">stÅ«pa 
  specially constructed for that purpose.</p>
    <p>It is not possible to form a clear 
  idea about the work accomplished at the Council. Some scholars think that the 
  chief business of the Council was to collect canonical texts, and to prepare 
  commentaries of different schools of Buddhism.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[38]<![endif]></a></p>
    <p>Tradition seems to connect the rise of
  <span class="SpellE">MÄhÄnÄnana with Kaniska and with the Buddhist 
  Council held during his reign.<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[39]<![endif]></a> 
  The fact that this Council is recognised by the <span class="SpellE">
  MahÄnÄnists<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[40]<![endif]></a> 
  is also taken as evidence on this point. But a close scrutiny of the available 
  information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried 
  out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon. It is a fact 
  that <span class="SpellE">TÄrÄnÄtha observes that all kinds of
  <span class="SpellE">MahÄyÄnist writing appeared at this time and that 
  the <span class="SpellE">TheravÄdins raised no objection. But he 
  neither clearly states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest 
  in promoting MahÄyÄna teachings, or that any 
  MahÄyÄna treatises were composed at that Council. On the other hand, it is 
  generally regarded that this Council was exclusively a council of the
  <span class="SpellE">SarvÄstivÄdins of northern India and that the
  <span class="SpellE">MahÄyÄnists did not take part in it.<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[41]<![endif]></a> 
  It is apparent that after holding this Council the <span class="SpellE">
  SarvÄstivÄdin school of Buddhism gained more importance than before.</p>
    <p>Whatever the tradition is there is no 
  reasonable ground to hold that Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid 
  spread of <span class="SpellE">MahÄyÄnism and that the Council held 
  during his reign was a MahÄyÄna Buddhist<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[42]<![endif]></a> 
  Council. It is plausible to hold that he was more bent towards
  <span class="SpellE">SarvÄstivÄda teachings and this is established by 
  the inscription on the relic casket.</p>
    <p>Of the numerous <span class="SpellE">
  stÅ«pas he is said to have built, the most famous is the one at Shah-<span class="SpellE">ji-ki-Dheri 
  near Peshawar. From the accounts of the Chinese travellers of the fifth and 
  seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders at the time. This
  <span class="SpellE">stÅ«pa is said to have been 130 metres in height, 
  resting upon a stone substructure 50 metres high, topped by an iron mast 10 
  metres high with gilded metal discs. It is assumed that the original form of 
  the <span class="SpellE">stÅ«pa as it appeared in the days of
  <span class="GramE">Kaniska, looked quite different from the form that 
  could be reconstructed from the ruins. It is also believed that it was rebuilt 
  many times.<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[43]<![endif]></a></p>
    <p>The reliquary enshrined in the Kaniska 
  cetiya is also worthy of note. The object is a round pyxis, made of an
  <span class="SpellE">amalgum of precious metals. The lower hand of the 
  drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing
  <span class="SpellE">erotes and KusÄna sovereign, identified by 
  scholars as Kaniska, between the divinities of the sun and moon; on the side 
  of the lid is a flock of geese (<span class="SpellE">hamsa). To the top 
  of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha, flanked by 
  Indra and <span class="SpellE">BrahmÄ. The most interesting feature of 
  the object is the Greek name of the maker, <span class="SpellE">agesilas,
  <span class="GramE">the overseer of works at the Kaniska-<span class="SpellE">caitya. 
  The inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made â€œfor 
  acceptance of the teachers of the <span class="SpellE">SarvÄstivÄdin
  <span class="GramE">schoolâ€ and this is cited as evidence to prove that 
  Kaniska was an adherent of this school of Buddhism.<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[44]<![endif]></a></p>
    <p>During <span class="SpellE">Kaniskaâ€™s 
  reign his empire was enriched through trade carried on with countries outside 
  India, especially with Rome and Asia Minor, and as such he had the necessary 
  resources to patronise the arts. Many scholars believe that
  <span class="SpellE">GandhÄra art attained its peak during his reign.<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[45]<![endif]></a> 
  Tradition which credits Kaniska with having built many <span class="SpellE">
  <span class="GramE">stÅ«pas<span class="GramE">, also 
  seems to support this contention. According to Benjamin Rowland â€œThe Art of
  <span class="SpellE">GandhÄra is, properly speaking; the official art 
  of the <span class="SpellE">KushÄn emperor Kaniska and his successors<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[46]<![endif]></a> 
  (see also, GANDHÄ€RA).</p>
    <p>Like Asoka, Kaniska also helped 
  missionary activities. It was during his reign that Buddhism spread and became 
  firmly established in central and eastern Asia. There are no records of any 
  missionaries sent by him. But it is accepted that under his patronage Buddhism 
  greatly flourished and spread throughout his vast empire. One writer has 
  observed that â€œthere was ceaseless missionary activity throughout his vast 
  empire which extended from <span class="SpellE">Madhyadesa in India to 
  Central Asia. A truly integrated Asian culture came into existence at this 
  time..,â€œ<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[47]<![endif]></a> 
  Vincent Smith<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[48]<![endif]></a> 
  observes that the legend regarding his death possibly may be founded on fact.</p>
    <p>A statue of Kaniska was discovered by
  <span class="SpellE">Tokritila, in the village of 
  <span class="SpellE">MÄt. 
  In this headless statue the king is represented with his right hand resting on 
  a mace and the left clamping the hilt of the sword. He is dressed in a tunic 
  reaching down to the knees, and held round the loins by a girdle. He wears 
  heavy boots with straps round the ankles. Though headless, an inscription 
  found on it proves conclusively that it represents Kaniska.<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[49]<![endif]></a>&nbsp;</p>
