  <h2>Tathāgata</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An epithet of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, used by the 
Buddha in referring to himself. </p>
<p>The Commentaries (DA.i.59-67; 
AA.i.58-63; MA.39-43; UdA.128ff., etc.) give eight (sometimes 
expanded to sixteen) explanations of the word, which shows that there was 
probably no fixed tradition on the point. </p>
<p>The explanations indicate that the name 
can be used for any arahant, and not necessarily only for a Buddha. </p>
<p>The term was evidently pre-Buddhistic, 
though it has not yet been found in any pre-Buddhistic work.</p>
