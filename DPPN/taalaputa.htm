  <h2>Tālaputa, Tālaputa</h2>

<p>A natagāmani (stage-manager) of 
Rājagaha. With a company of five hundred men, he gave dramatic performances of 
great splendour in towns and villages and in royal courts, and won much fame and 
favour. One day he visited the Buddha and asked if it was true that players who 
delight large audiences are reborn among the gods of laughter. Three times the 
Buddha refused to answer, but in the end allowed himself to be persuaded, and 
told Tālaputa that those who induce sensual states in others will be reborn in 
purgatory. Tālaputa wept to think that older actors should so have deceived him 
in telling him of their theories, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered 
the Order and soon became an arahant (S.iv.306ff; Thag.1091-1145; 
ThagA.ii.155ff).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Commentary (SA.iii.100) 
says he obtained his name from his bright and cheerful colour, like that of a 
ripe palm-fruit.</p>
