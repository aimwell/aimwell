<p><b>1. Migāra. </b>A setthi of Sāvatthi. His son, 
Punnavaddhana, married Visākhā. He was evidently not as rich as Visākhā’s 
father, Dhanañjaya, for he drove back, on the plea that he could not afford to 
feed them, the large retinue who wished to follow Visākhā, to her new home. 
Migāra was a follower of the Niganthas, and was angry when Visākhā refused to 
wait on them and pay homage to them when they visited his house. One day, while 
Migāra was eating and Visākhā was standing by his side fanning him, a monk 
stopped at their door, and Visākhā stepped aside that Migāra might see him. But 
Migāra refused to notice the monk, whom, therefore, Visākhā asked to go away, 
saying that Migāra ate “stale food” (purānam). This greatly annoyed Migāra, and 
he ordered her to be cast out of the house. But the servants refused to carry 
out his orders, and he was obliged to agree to Visākhā’s suggestion that the 
matter should be submitted for arbitration to the eight householders who had 
accompanied her to enquire into disputes of such a nature. To them, therefore, 
Migāra recited a list of all his grievances against Visākhā, but she was 
adjudged quite innocent and threatened to return at once to her father. Migāra 
begged her to stay, and she agreed on condition that he invited the Buddha and 
his monks for a meal. He did so, but the Niganthas would not allow him to wait 
upon the Buddha. At the conclusion of the meal, however, out of politeness, he 
insisted on listening to the Buddha’s sermon, if only from behind a screen. At 
the conclusion of the sermon Migāra became a sotāpanna, and, realizing the error 
of his ways, adopted Visākhā as his mother by sucking her breast. Henceforth 
Visākhā was called Migāramātā. The next day, again, the Buddha was invited, and 
Migāra’s wife became a sotāpanna. From that day onwards they kept open house for 
the Buddha and his monks. As a token of his gratitude, Migāra held a great 
festival in honour of Visākhā, to which the Buddha and his monks were invited. 
She was bathed in sixteen pots of perfumed water and presented with a jeweled 
ornament called Ghanamatthakapasādhana (DhA.i.387ff.; AA.i.220; MA.i.471f). It 
is probably this same Migāra whose grandson was called Sālha (q.v.) Migāranattā; 
but see Migāra (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Migāra. </b>Son of Visākhā and Punnavaddhana. 
DhA.i.407; AA.i.313 says he was their eldest son.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Migāra Rohaneyya. </b>A very rich setthi of 
Sāvatthi. Ugga, Pasenadi’s minister, mentions him during a visit to the Buddha 
and remarks on his immense wealth. But the Buddha reminds him that Migāra’s 
treasure is not real treasure in that it is subject to various dangers&nbsp;&nbsp; 
fire, water, kings, robbers, enemies and heirs. A.iv.7.</p>
<p>The Commentary says (AA.ii.697) that Migāra was called 
Rohaneyya because he was the grandson of Rohanasetthi. He is probably to be 
distinguished from Visākhā’s son.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Migāra. </b>A general of Kassapa I. He built a 
parivena called after himself and a house for an image of Abhiseka Buddha, for 
which he also instituted a festival. Cv.xxxix.6, 40.</p>
