<p>An arahant. In a previous birth he saw 
Padumuttara Buddha journeying through the air and wished to offer him some 
water. He, therefore, threw some water into the air, which the Buddha, out of 
compassion, stopped to receive.</p>
<p>Sixty-five kappas ago Udakapūjaka became 
king three times under the name of Sahassarāja (Ap.i.142-3).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Kutivihāriya Thera. ThagA.i.129.</p>
