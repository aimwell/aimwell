  <h2>Ambattha Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Icchānankala when 
Ambattha-mānava visited the Buddha (D.i.87ff).</p>
<p>Reference is made to the Commentary on 
this sutta where a detailed explanation is given of the term cārikā (AA.i.407). 
It is regarded, together with the Sonadanda and Kūtadanta Suttas, as one of the 
chief discussions which the Buddha had with his opponents (MA.ii.697). The eight 
kinds of vijjā are detailed therein. Sp.i.116; ii.495.</p>
