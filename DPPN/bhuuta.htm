<p><b>1. Bhūta Thera. </b>The son of a very wealthy councillor of 
<a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>, his last 
and only child, the others having been devoured by a <a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkha</a>. The child was, 
therefore, well guarded at his birth, but the Yakkha had meanwhile gone to wait 
on <a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> and had not returned. The boy was called Bhūta so that non humans 
might protect him. He grew up in great luxury, but, like <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa</a>, having heard the 
Buddha preach at Sāketa, he entered the Order and dwelt on the banks of the 
<a href="ajakaranii.htm" title="am/ajakaranii.htm">Ajakaranī</a>, where he attained arahantship. Later, when visiting his relations, he 
stayed in the <a href="anjana_vana.htm" title="ay/anjana_vana.htm">Añjanavana</a>. They besought him to remain there, but this he refused 
to do.</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a brahmin and, 
seeing the Buddha, he sang his praises in four verses. Fourteen kappas ago he 
became king four times under the name of Uggata. Thag.vs.518 26; ThagA.i.493ff.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Parappasādaka Thera of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.113f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhūta. </b>An officer of Parakkamabāhu I. He bore 
  the title Bhandārapotthakī, and later came to be called Adhikāri. 
  Cv.lxxii.196; lxxiv. 72, 119, 136; lxxv. 196.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhūta. </b>The son of a householder of Sāvatthi, 
  his mother being Tissā and his step mother <a href="mattaa.htm" title="ma/mattaa.htm">Mattā</a>. PvA.82.</p>
