<p>A tribe of Nāgas present at the 
preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.259). Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.688) says they 
lived at the foot of Sineru and were so powerful that they could resist even the 
Supannas (DA.ii.688).</p>
<p>They were among the Nāgas assembled by 
Dhatarattha to help him in winning Samuddajā (J.vi.165). They are always 
mentioned with the Kambala Nāgas.</p>
