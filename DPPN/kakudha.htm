<p>1. Kakudha (v.l. Kakkata).-A lay 
disciple of the Buddha who dwelt at Nādikā. When the Buddha arrived at Nādikā on 
his last journey, Ānanda asked him what had happened to Kakudha, who was already 
dead. The Buddha replied that Kakudha had found birth in the highest heavens, 
there to pass away entirely (D.ii.92).</p>
<p>2. Kakudha.-A deva. He visited the 
Buddha at the Añjanavana in Sāketa, and asked him whether he experienced 
feelings of pleasure and sorrow. The Buddha replied that he had overcome such 
feelings and was utterly free, whereupon Kakudha uttered his praises (S.i.54f). 
The Commentary (SA.i.89) says that this Kakudha was a Brahma and that he was an 
attendant of Moggallāna, thus identifying him with Kakudha (3 below). He lived 
with the thera in his youth, died in a Jhāna-trance and was reborn in the 
Brahma-world.</p>
<p>3. Kakudha.-Probably identical with 
Kakudha (2). He was an inhabitant of Koliya and was an attendant of Moggallāna. 
Having died, he was reborn among the mind-born (Manomaya) devas and his form was 
so great that it was as extensive as “two of three common rice-fields in a 
Magadha village, and yet so constituted that he was in the way neither of 
himself nor of others.” Becoming aware of Devadatta’s plans for obtaining 
possession of the leadership of the Sangha, Kakudha reported the news to 
Moggallāna, who passed it on to the Buddha. The Buddha asked Moggallāna to keep 
the matter secret. Moggallāna informed the Buddha that he knew from experience 
that Kakudha’s predictions proved true (Vin.ii.185f).</p>
<p>4. Kakudha.-A Pacceka Buddha of 
thirty-one kappas ago, to whom Uddāladāyaka Thera, in a previous birth, gave a 
flower. Ap.i.225.</p>
<p>5. Kakudha.-A bird in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha and a previous birth of Malitavambha Thera. The bird gave the 
Buddha a lotus. v.l. Kukkuttha. ThagA.i.211; Ap.i.180.</p>
<p>6. Kakudha Kaccāna.-See Pakudha Kaccāna.</p>
<p>7. Kakudha.-A little pond in 
Mahāmeghavana between the site of the Mahā-Thūpa and the Thūpārāma. The 
Mahā-Thūpa was at the upper end of the pond, and the spot had been consecrated 
by the visit of the four Buddhas of the present kappa (Mhv.xv.53ff). Lañjatissa 
appears to have filled up the pond at great expense, the land around having 
become waterlogged (Mhv.xxxiii.23f; MT.611). The bund (pāli) of the pond formed 
part of the Sīmā at Anurādhapura. Mbv.135f.</p>
