<p>A pork butcher near Veluvana. For 
forty-five years he plied his trade, killing pigs in such a way as to retain the 
flavour of the flesh unimpaired. When death approached he saw before him the 
fires of Avīci and roared with pain. For seven days he grunted like a pig, 
crawling on all fours, and no one could prevent him. The monks told the Buddha 
of the noises they had heard when passing the butcher’s house, and the Buddha 
explained how retribution had fallen on Cunda commensurate with his wickedness.
