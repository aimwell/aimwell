<p>A rich man of Mithilā. He had no 
children and was ugly; when he spoke saliva flowed from his mouth, and two 
beautiful women, standing beside him, wiped his face with blue lilies and threw 
them away. When revellers had no money wherewith to buy flowers, they would 
stand outside Gorimanda’s house and call out for him. When he leaned out of the 
window to ask what they wanted, his face had to be wiped with lilies and the 
lilies were then thrown away. The revellers picked them up, washed them, and 
wore them at their revels. J.vi.367f.</p>
