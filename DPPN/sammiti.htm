<p>A division of the Vajjiputtakā (Dpv.v.46; Mhv.v.7; Mbv. 
p.96). They held that there is no higher life practised among Devas, that the 
convert gives up corruption piecemeal, and that the putthujjana renounces, 
passion and hate (Kvu.i.1, 3, 4, 5). They also held various views in common with 
other schismatic schools, such as the Andhakas, Pubbaseliyas, etc. In Tibetan 
sources they are called Sammatiyā, and are described as disciples of a teacher 
named Sammata. Rockhill, op. cit., 184.</p>
