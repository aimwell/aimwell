<p>A country. At the end of the Third Council, the theras 
Sona and Uttara visited this country in order to convert it to Buddhism. At that 
time a female deity of the sea was in the habit of eating every heir born to the 
king. The arrival of the theras coincided with the birth of a prince. At first 
the people thought that the monks were the friends of the demon, but later the 
monks, being told the story, drove away the demon by their iddhi power and 
erected a bulwark round the country by reciting the Brahmajāla Sutta. Sixty 
thousand people embraced the new faith, while three thousand five hundred young 
men and fifteen hundred girls of noble family entered the Order. Thenceforth all 
princes born into the royal family were called Sonuttara (Mhv.xii.6, 44f.; 
Dpv.viii.12; Sp.i.64).</p>
<p>There seems to have been regular trade between Bharukaccha 
and Suvannabhūmi (See, e.g., J.iii.188), and also between the latter and Benares 
(Molini), (J.iv.15), Mithilā (J.vi.34), Sāvatthi 
(PvA.47), and Pātaliputta (PvA.271).</p>
<p>The distance between Ceylon and Suvannabhūmi was seven 
hundred leagues, and, with a favourable wind, could be covered in seven days and 
nights (AA.i.265).</p>
<p>Suvannabhūmi is generally identified with Lower Burma, 
probably the Pagan and Moulmein districts. It probably included the coast from 
Rangoon to Singapore. The chief place in Suvannabhūmi was Sudhammanagara — 
i.e., Thaton — at the mouth of the Sittaung River (See Sās. Introd., p.4, and 
n.3). Fleet suggests (J.R.A.S.1910, p.428), however, that it might be the 
district in Bengal called by Hiouen Thsang “Ka-lo-na-su-fa-la-na” (Karnasuvarna), 
or else the country along the river Son in Central India, a tributary of the 
Ganges, on the right bank of the river which is also called Hiranyavāha. The 
probability is that there were two Places of the same name, one originally in 
India itself and the other in Further India. of. Sunāparanta.</p>
