<p>1. Annabhāra.-A well-known paribbājaka 
who lived in the Paribbājakārāma on the banks of the River Sappinī near 
Rājagaha. He is mentioned as staying with the well-known paribbājakas, Varadhara 
and Sakuludāyi. The Buddha visits them and talks about the four factors of 
Dhamma (dhammapadāni) which are held in esteem by everyone: not-coveting, 
not-malice, right-mindfulness, right-concentration (A.ii.29-31).</p>
<p>On another occasion they discuss the “brahmin 
truth.” The Buddha visits them and tells them what he considers to be the 
brahmin truths (brāhmanasaccāni): that no creatures are to be harmed; all 
sense-delights are impermanent, painful and changing; all becomings are 
impermanent, etc.; a brahmin is one who has no part in or attachment to anything 
any more (A.ii.176-7).</p>

<p>2. Annabhāra.-A former birth of
