<p>A monk, one of the associates of 
Devadatta, mentioned with Kokālika, Katamoraka Tissa and Samuddadatta. They 
helped Devadatta in his attempt to cause a rift in the Sangha (Vin.ii.196; 
iii.171). Khandadeviyāputta defended Devadatta when others blamed him 
(Vin.iii.174) and was held in great esteem by Thullanandā (Vin.iii.66; iv.335). 
The Khuddakapātha Commentary (KhpA.126) mentions him in a list of wicked 
persons, together with those mentioned above, Ciñcamānavikā, and the brother of 
Dīghavidassa.</p>
