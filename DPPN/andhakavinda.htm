  <h2>Andhakavinda</h2>

<p>A village in the Magadha country, three 
gāvuta from Rājagaha. Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises 
in the Gijjhakūta (Vin.i.109; Vin. Texts i.254, n.2). Once the Buddha went from 
Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying 
cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many 
awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) 
had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding 
that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his 
turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency 
he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he 
approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, 
the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the 
monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good 
qualities of milk-rice. Vin.i.220f.; it was this praise uttered by the Buddha 
that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply 
milk-rice to the monks throughout her life (ibid., 293); see also UdA.112.</p>
<p>During the same visit of the Buddha, a 
newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the 
fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid 
milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather 
rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven 
would be his inheritance (Vin.i.222f. This was the occasion for the rule that 
monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice 
somewhere else earlier in the same day.). It was on the way back from 
Andhakavinda to Rājagaha that the Buddha met Belattha Kaccāna (Vin.i.224f).</p>
<p>Once when the Buddha was staying at 
Andhakavinda the Brahmā Sahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent 
beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses 
of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life (S.i.154). 
Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ānanda the necessity of admonishing and 
encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, 
control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of 
solitude and the cultivation of right views (A.iii.138-9; referred to in 
Sp.iv.789). Once in Andhakavinda the Buddha suffered from disease of the wind. 
Ānanda was asked to obtain gruel for the complaint. The wife of the village 
physician supplied the gruel with great devotion, and as a result was born in 
Tāvatimsa, where her abode was known as the Kañjikādāyika vimāna (VvA.185-6). 
Another lay devotee built a Gandhakuti for the Buddha at Andhakavinda, and 
personally looked after the Buddha while he was there. This upāsaka was also, as 
a result, born in Tāvatimsa in a golden vimāna (VvA.302-3).</p>
<p>Cūlasetthi’s daughter, Anulā, lived in 
Andhakavinda after her marriage and it was there that she gave alms on behalf of 
her dead father (PvA.105-9).</p>
