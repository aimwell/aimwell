<p><b>1. Kumāra-Kassapa Thera.</b>-He was foremost 
among those who had the gift of varied and versatile discourse (cittakathikānam) 
(A.i.24). His mother was the daughter of a banker of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, and she, having 
failed to obtain her parent’s consent to become a nun, married and, with her 
husband’s consent, joined the Order, not knowing that she was with child. When 
her condition was discovered her colleagues consulted 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>, who declared 
that she was no true nun. The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, on being consulted, entrusted the matter 
to <a href="upaali.htm" title="u/upaali.htm">Upāli</a>, who had it fully investigated by 
<a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a> and other residents of 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, and he gave his finding in the assembly, in the presence of the king, 
that the nun was innocent. (For details see J.i.148; Upāli’s handling of the 
case won the Buddha’s special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172). When the boy 
was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven. The 
boy came to be called Kumāra, because he joined the Order so young and was of 
royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little 
delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kumāra Kassapa. Once when Kumāra 
Kassapa was meditating in <a href="andhavana.htm" title="ay/andhavana.htm">Andhavana</a>, an anāgāmī Brahmā, who had been his 
companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him 
fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer. This led to the preaching 
of the <a href="vammiika_sutta.htm" title="va/vammiika_sutta.htm">Vammika Sutta</a> (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa 
became an arahant. (For Kumāra Kassapa’s story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; 
ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f). His mother, too, developed insight and attained to 
arahantship. It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be 
with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and 
fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe. Kassapa, realising that her 
great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that 
she might love him the less. The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that 
very day (DhA.iii.147).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha 
Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in 
eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety 
towards that end. When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, 
together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous 
asceticism on the summit of a mountain. (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story 
are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa’s companions were also Pukkusāti, 
Dārucīriya, Dabba Mallaputta and Sabhiya; see also UdA.80f).</p>
<p>Two verses of deep significance ascribed 
to Kumāra-Kassapa are found in the Theragāthā (vv.201.202). Although it is said 
that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are 
extremely scanty. The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave 
him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with Pāyāsi, as related in 
the <a href="payasi.htm" title="pa/payasi.htm">Pāyāsi Sutta</a>; but this cannot be correct for, according to
<a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> 
(VvA.297), the events of the Pāyāsi Sutta took place after the Buddha’s death. 
The Sutta, however, does justify Kassapa’s reputation. (For his praises see also 
MA.i.500f).</p>
<p>Kassapa’s upasampadā took place in his 
twentieth year. A doubt arose as to whether this was valid because, according to 
the rule, twenty years must be completed for upasampadā. The Buddha held that in 
reckoning the age the time spent in the mother’s womb could also be included.
