<p><b>1. Asoka.</b>-King of <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>. He was the 
son of <a href="bindusara.htm" title="b/bindusara.htm">Bindusāra</a>. Bindusāra had sixteen wives who bore him 101 sons. </p>
<p>The chief Pāli sources of information 
regarding Asoka are Dīpavamsa (chaps. i., v., vi., vii., xi., etc.), Mahāvamsa 
(v., xi., xx., etc.), Samantapāsādikā (pp. 
<st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="35 ff">35 ff</st2:frenchfranctoeuro>. 
). Other sources are the Divyāvadāna passim, and the Avadānasataka ii.200ff. For 
an exhaustive discussion of the sources and their contents see Prszlyski, La 
Legende de l'Empereur Asoka.</p>
<p>The Pāli Chronicles (Dīpavamsa and 
Mahāvamsa) mention only three of the sons, viz. Sumana (Susīma according to the 
northern legends) the eldest, Asoka, and Tissa (uterine brother of Asoka) the 
youngest. The Mahāvamsa Tīka (p.125; Mbv.98. In the northern tradition, e.g., 
Asokāvadānamālā, she is called Subhadrāngī, daughter of a brahmin of Campā) 
gives the name of his mother as Dhammā and calls her Aggamahesī (Bindusāra’s 
chief queen); she belonged to the Moriyavamsa. The preceptor of Dhammā’s family 
was an Ājīvaka called Janasāna (which probably explains Asoka’s earlier 
patronage of the Ājīvakas).</p>
<p>In his youth Asoka was appointed 
Governor of Avanti with his capital at Ujjeni. The Divy. says he was in 
Takkasilā with headquarters in Uttarāpatha, where he superseded Susīma and 
quelled a rebellion. When Bindusāra lay on his death-bed, Asoka left Ujjeni and 
came to Pātalīputta where he made himself master of the city and possessor of 
the throne. He is stated in the Mahāvamsa (v.20; Mbv.98) to have killed all his 
brothers except Tissa that he might accomplish his purpose, and to have been 
called Candāsoka on account of this outrage (Mhv.v.189). It is impossible to say 
how much truth there is in this account of the accession. Asoka’s Rock Edicts 
seem to indicate that he had numerous brothers, sisters and relations alive at 
the time they were written in Pātaliputta and other towns (see Mookherji, Asoka, 
pp. 3-6). His brother Tissa he appointed as his uparāja (Mhv.v.33), but Tissa 
(q.v.) became a religious devotee attaining arahantship. The Theragāthā 
Commentary refers to another younger brother of Asoka, Vitasoka, who also became 
an arahant (i.295f. The northern works give quite a different account of his 
brothers. See Mookherji, p.6).</p>
<p>Asoka had several wives. His first wife 
was the daughter of a merchant of Vedisagiri, whom he met when stopping at the 
merchant’s house on his way to Ujjeni (Mhv.xiii.8ff). Her name was Devī, also 
called Vedisa-Mahādevī, and she was a Sākyan, descended from a Sākyan family who 
migrated to Vedisa to escape from Vidūdabha (Mbv., pp.98, 116). Of Devī were 
born a son Mahinda, and a daughter Sanghamittā, who became the wife of 
Aggibrahmā and mother of Sumana. Devī evidently did not follow Asoka to 
Pātaliputta, for his aggamahesī there was Asandhamittā (Mhv.v.85). Asandhamittā 
died in the thirtieth year of Asoka’s reign, and four years later he raised 
Tissarakkhā to the rank of queen. Mhv.xx.1-3. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription 
mentions another queen, Kāruvākī, mother of Tivara. The Divy. (chap. xxvii.) 
gives another, Padmāvatī, Kunāla’s mother. Besides the children mentioned above, 
names of others are given: Jalauka, Cārumatī (Mookherji. p.9).</p>
<p>According to Mahāvamsa (v.21, 22), 
Asoka’s accession was 218 years after the Buddha’s death and his coronation was 
four years later. The chronicles (v.22ff) contain various stories of his 
miraculous powers. His command spread a yojana into the air and a yojana under 
the earth. The devas supplied him daily with water from the Anotatta Lake and 
with other luxuries from elsewhere. Yakkhas, Nāgas and even mice and karavīka 
birds ministered to his comfort, and thoughtful animals came and died outside 
his kitchen in order to provide him with food.</p>
<p>At first Asoka maintained the alms 
instituted by his father, but soon, being disappointed in the recipients, he 
began looking out for holy men. It was then that he saw from his window, his 
nephew, the young novice Nigrodha. Owing to their friendship in a past birth (Asoka, 
Devanampiyatissa and Nigrodha had been brothers, traders in honey, and they gave 
honey to a Pacceka Buddha. Asandhamittā had been the maiden who showed the 
honey-shop to the Pacceka Buddha. The story is given in Mhv.v.49ff), Asoka was 
at once drawn to him and invited him into the palace. Nigrodha preached to him 
the Appamādavagga and the king was greatly pleased. He ceased his benefactions 
to other religious orders and transferred his patronage to Nigrodha and members 
of the Buddhist Order. His wealth, which, according to the Samantapāsādikā 
(i.52), amounted to 500,000 pieces daily, he now spent in doing acts of piety — 
giving 100,000 to Nigrodha to be used in any manner he wished, a like sum for 
the offering of perfumes and flowers at the Buddha’s shrines, 100,000 for the 
preaching of the Dhamma, 100,000 for the provision of comforts for members of 
the Order, and the remainder for medicines for the sick. To Nigrodha, in 
addition to other gifts, he sent sets of robes three times each day, placing 
them on the back of an elephant, adorned by festoons of flowers. Nigrodha gave 
these robes to other monks (MA.ii.931).</p>
<p>Having learnt from Moggaliputta-Tissa 
that there were 84,000 sections of the Dhamma, he built in various towns an 
equal number of vihāras, and in Pātaliputta he erected the Asokārāma. With the 
aid of the Nāga king Mahākāla, he created a life-size figure of the Buddha, to 
which he made great offerings.</p>
<p>His two children, Mahinda and 
Sanghamittā, aged respectively twenty and eighteen, he ordained under 
Moggaliputta-Tissa and Dhammapālā, in the sixth year of his reign (MA.v.197, 
209). This raised him from a paccadāyaka to a sāsanadāyādin.</p>
<p>In order to purge the Order of 
undesirable monks and heretical doctrines, Moggaliputta-Tissa held the Third 
Council under the king’s patronage. It is said that the pious monks refused to 
hold the uposatha with those they considered unworthy. The king, desirous of 
bringing about unity in the Sangha, sent a minister to restore amity, but the 
minister, misunderstanding his orders, beheaded many holy monks, being at last 
stopped by the king’s brother Tissa, who was then a monk (MA.vs.240ff).</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Council, held 
in the seventeenth year of his reign (Ibid., 280; in the northern texts 
Moggaliputta-Tissa’s name is given as Upagupta. It was for this Council that the 
Kathāvatthu was written), Asoka sent forth theras to propagate the Buddha’s 
religion: Majjhantika to Kasmīra and Gandhāra, Mahādeva to Mahisamandala, 
Rakkhita to Vanavāsa, Yona Dhammarakkhita to Aparantaka, Mahārakkhita to Yona, 
Majjhima to the Himālaya country and Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhūmi; Mahinda 
with Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasāla he sent to Lankā (Ibid., xii.1-8. 
For particulars of these missions and identification of the places mentioned, 
see under the different names; this list appears also in the Samantapāsādikā, 
where further interesting details are given. For a discussion on them see 
Mookherji, pp.33ff). In the eighteenth year of his reign he sent to Lankā, at 
Devanampiyatissa’s request, Sanghamittā, with a branch of the great Bodhi Tree 
at Buddhagayā (Mhv.xx.1). A little earlier he had sent by his grandson Sumana, 
some relics of the Buddha and the Buddha’s alms-bowl to be deposited in the 
thūpas of Lankā (Mhv.xvii.10f).</p>
<p>Asoka reigned for thirty-seven years 
(Mhv.xx.6). In his later life he came to be called Dhammāsoka on account of his 
pious deeds (Mhv.v.189). The Dīpavamsa gives his name in several places as 
Piyadassī. E.g., vi.1, 2, 25. The title Devānampiya used by Asoka in his 
inscriptions was also used by Tissa, Asoka’s contemporary in Ceylon, and by 
Asoka’s grandson Dasaratha (Nāgarjunī Hill Cave Inscription). It was used also 
by other kings in Ceylon: Vankanāsika Tissa, Gajabāhukagāminī and Mahallaka-Nāga 
(Ep. Zeyl. i.60.f).</p>
<p>The Chronicles state that Asoka and 
<a href="devaanampiyatissa.htm" title="d/devaanampiyatissa.htm">Devanampiya Tissa</a> of Ceylon had been friends — though they had never seen each 
other — even before Mahinda’s mission to Ceylon. Tissa had sent him, as a 
friendly gesture, various gifts, and Asoka had returned the courtesy. He sent an 
embassy of his chosen ministers, bearing gifts marvellous in splendour, that 
Tissa might go through a second coronation ceremony, and the messengers were 
directed to give this special message to the king: “I have taken refuge in the 
Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and declared myself a follower of the religion of the 
Sākyaputta. Seek then, even thou, oh best of men, converting thy mind with 
believing heart, refuge in these best of gems.” (Mhv.xi.18-36)</p>
<p>The Milindapanha (p.121) mentions an 
encounter of Asoka with a courtesan of Pātaliputta, Bindumatī, who, in order to 
show the king the power of an Act of Truth, made the waters of the Ganges to 
flow back. According to the Petavatthu Atthakathā (244ff) there was a king of 
Surattha, called Pingala, who used to visit Asoka in order to give him counsel. 
Perhaps he was an old friend or tutor of the king.</p>
<p>Asoka is called a dīpacakkavatti as 
opposed to padesarājās like Bimbisāra and Pasenadi (Sp.ii.309).</p>
<p>Asoka had three palaces for the three 
seasons: Mahāsappika, Moragīva and Mangala (Ras.i.93).</p>

<p><b>5. Asoka.</b>-Attendant to Vipassī Buddha 
(J.i.41; Bu.xx.28). He was once ill and was cured by a doctor who, in this age, 
was Tikicchaka (Tekicchakānī) Thera. Ap.i.190; ThagA.i.442.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Asoka.</b>-The chief disciple of the 
future Buddha Metteyya (Anāgatavamsa. v.97). According to the Mahāvamsa 
(xxxii.81) he should be identified with Dutthagāmanī.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Asoka.</b>-A monk of Ñātikā. Once when 
the Buddha was staying at Ñātikā in the Giñjakāvasatha, Ānanda mentions to the 
Buddha that Asoka Thera had died, and asks where he had gone. The Buddha tells 
him that Asoka was an arahant and had realised Nibbana. S.i.358.</p>
