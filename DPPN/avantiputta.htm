<p>King of Madhurā. His mother was the 
sister of Pajjota, King of Avanti, hence the name Avantiputta (MA.ii.738).
</p>
<p>He once went in royal state to visit 
Mahā Kaccāna who was staying in the Gundā Grove in Madhurā. </p>
<p>Their discussion is recorded in the

<p>It is said that after the interview 
Avantiputta became a follower of the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
