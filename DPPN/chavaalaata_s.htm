<p>Some people are bent neither on their 
own profit nor on that of others, some only on another’s profit, some only on 
their own, and yet others on the profit of both themselves and others. He who 
belongs to the first class is like a firebrand from a funeral pyre, blazing at 
both ends, smeared with dung in the middle, useless for any purpose. A.ii.95.</p>
