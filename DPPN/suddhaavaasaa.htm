  <h2>Suddhāvāsā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The “Pure Abodes”; a name given to a group of 
Brahma-worlds — the five highest Rūpa worlds — consisting of </p>
<ul>
  <li>Avihā, </li>
  <li>Atappā, </li>
  <li>Sudassā, </li>
  <li>Sudassī and </li>
  <li>Akanitthā (E.g., D.iii.237). </li>
</ul>
<p>There anāgāmīs are born, and there they attain 
arahantship; such anāgāmīs are divided into twenty four classes (See, e.g., 
KhA.182f.; of. PSA. 319; Vsm.710). </p>
<p>Bodhisattas are never born there (SNA.i.50; BuA.224).
</p>
<p>The  Suddhāvāsā are described as buddhānam 
khandhāvāratthānasadisā. Sometimes, for asankheyyas of kappas, when no Buddhas 
are born, these worlds remain empty (AA.ii.808; cf. MA.i.30). </p>
<p>The Buddha is mentioned as having visited the Suddhāvāsā 
(E.g., D.ii.50). When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the 
Suddhāvāsā insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and 
teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge 
buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being 
(MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the Suddhāvāsā know how many Buddhas 
will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which 
spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges 
after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411). It is the Suddhāvāsā Brahmās who 
provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta’s renunciation in his last lay 
life. See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.</p>
