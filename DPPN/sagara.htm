<p><b>1. Sāgara.</b> The personal attendant of Sumedha 
Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xii.23.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sāgara. </b>A khattiya, father of Atthadassī Buddha 
and husband of Sudassanā. He lived in Sobhana (Bu.xv.14; J.i.39). The Apadāna 
(Ap.i.153; cf. ThagA.i.153) mentions a monk, named Sāgara, a disciple of 
Atthadassī Buddha, who continued to live after the Buddha’s death. The two may 
have been identical.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sāgara. </b>See Gunasāgara.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sāgara. </b>A king of long ago, mentioned in a list 
of persons, who, though they held great almsgivings, could not attain beyond the 
Kāmāvacara worlds (J.vi.99). It is probably the same king that is mentioned in 
the Bhūridatta Jātaka (J.vi.203) as having become a mahesakkha deva after death.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sāgara.</b> Elder son of Mahāsāgara, king of 
Uttaramadhurā. Upasāgara was his younger brother. Sāgara was killed by the 
Andhakavenhuputtā. The story is given in the Ghata Jātaka. J.iv.79f.</p>

Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa. Dpv.xix.8; MT.525.</p>
