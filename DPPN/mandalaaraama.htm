Bhokkanta. It was the residence of the Elder Mahā Tissa, reciter of the 
Dhammapada. </p>

assembly of the monks, the story of her past lives (DhA.iv.51). </p>
<p>According to the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.448; also 
DhSA.30; AA.i.52) the monastery was in the village of Kālakagāma, 
and, in the time of Vattagāmanī, it was the residence of many monks, at the head 
of whom was Tissabhūta. </p>
<p>It was also the residence of Maliyadeva Thera. AA.i.22.</p>
