<p><b>l. Jambuka Thera.</b>-He was born in 
Rājagaha of rich parents but from infancy he would eat nothing but excrement. 
When he grew older he was ordained with the <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ājīvakas</a>, who pulled out his hair 
with a palmyra comb. When the Ajivakas discovered that he ate filth, they 
expelled him and he lived as a naked ascetic, practising all kinds of 
austerities and accepting no offerings save butter and honey placed on the tip 
of his tongue with the point of a blade of grass. His fame spread far. When he 
was fifty-five years old, the Buddha visited him and spent the night in a cave 
near his abode. During the night, Jambuka saw mighty gods come to pay homage to 
the Buddha and was so impressed that the next day he sought the Buddha’s 
counsel. The Buddha told him of his past evil deeds which had condemned him to 
practise austerities for so long and counselled him to give up his evil ways. In 
the course of the sermon, Jambuka grew ashamed of his nakedness and the Buddha 
gave him a bath-robe. At the end of the discourse Jambuka became an arahant, and 
when the inhabitants of Anga and Magadha came to him with their offerings, he 
performed a miracle before them and paid homage to the Buddha, acknowledging him 
as his teacher.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka 
was a monk and had a lay patron who looked after him. One day a pious monk came 
to his vihāra, and the layman, being pleased with him, showed him much 
attention. The resident monk, very jealous, reviled the visitor, saying, “It 
would be better for you to eat filth than food in this layman’s house, to tear 
your hair with a palmyra comb than let his barber cut it for you, to go naked 
than wear robes given by him, to lie on the ground than on a bed provided by 
him.” The Elder, not wishing to be the cause of his sinning, left the monastery 
the next day. Because of this act, the meditations practised by Jambuka for 
twenty thousand years were of no avail, and he was born in Avīci, where he 
suffered torments during an interval between two Buddhas. In this last life, 
too, he was condemned to suffer in many ways, as related above (DhA.ii.52-63; 
Thag.283-6; ThagA.i.386f).</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a 
householder and made offerings at the Buddha’s Bodhi-tree, fanning the Buddha’s 
seat with a fan. He is probably identical with Sīhāsanavījanīya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.403).</p>
<p>It is said (Mil.350; AA.i.57) 
that when the Buddha preached to Jambuka, eighty-four thousand others realised 
the Truth.</p>

<p><b>2. Jambuka.</b>-A parrot, an incarnation of 
the Bodhisatta, adopted as his son by <a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>, king of Benares. He preached 
to the king on the fivefold power — of limbs, of wealth, of counsel, of caste 
and of wisdom — the last being the best. The king thereupon appointed him 
commander-in-chief. J.v.111, 120, 125.</p>

<p><b>3. Jambuka.</b>-A dog, companion of the 
she-goat in the <a href="putimamsa_jat_437.htm" title="pu/putimamsa_jat_437.htm">Pūtimamsa Jātaka</a>. J.iii.535.</p>
