<p>1. Uposatha Suttā.-Suttas dealing with 
questions asked by monks of the Buddha as to why certain Nāgas (egg-born, 
womb-born, moisture-born and born without parents) should keep the fast day, 
divesting themselves of their Nāga forms! The Buddha replies that they do so 
because they wish to be born in happy states. S.iii.241f.</p>
<p>2. Uposatha Sutta.-One Uposatha-day, the 
Buddha, surrounded by the company of monks, was seated in the Migāramātu-pāsāda, 
in Sāvatthi. Looking round and finding them seated in silence, he spoke their 
praises, saying how some of them had won access to the devas, some to Brahma, 
others to the Imperturbable (ānejja), and yet others to the Ariyan state. 
A.ii.183f.</p>
<p>3. Uposatha Sutta.-One uposatha-night, 
during the first watch, Ānanda approaches the Buddha and asks him to recite the 
Pātimokkha. Three times he asks, but the Buddha remains silent, and at last says 
that the assembly is impure. Mahāmoggallāna, who is present, looks round, and 
seeing there a monk given up to wicked ways, asks him to leave. On his refusing 
to do so, Moggallāna takes him by the hand and leads him away. Thereupon the 
Buddha proceeds to explain how, just as the sea is full of eight kinds of 
marvels, so is the Dhamma. A.iv.204ff.</p>
<p>4. Uposatha (v.l. Uposathanga) 
Sutta.-Visākhā, having taken the uposatha vows, visits the Buddha at noontide in 
the Migāramātu-pāsāda. The Buddha explains to her that there are various ways of 
observing the sabbath; these he describes as the herdsman’s sabbath, the sabbath 
of the naked ascetics and the sabbath of the Ariyans. A.i.206f.</p>
