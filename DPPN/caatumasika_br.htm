<p>1. Cātumāsika-Brahmadatta.-A king of 
Benares. Going to his park in the early summer, he rested under a kovilāra-tree 
which was thickly covered with leaves. Going again in midsummer, he found it 
full of blossom. On his third visit, at the end of the season, the tree was bare 
and withered, and, lying under it, he realised that decay and death are the 
common lot of all. He thereupon became a Pacceka Buddha. His udāna is included 
in the Khaggavisāna Sutta. SN.vs.44; SNA.i.90f; Ap.i.9 (vs.18); ApA.i.141f.</p>

<p>2. Cātumāsika-Brahmadatta.-King of 
Benares. Once in every four months he would visit his park. One day, on entering 
the park, he saw a pāricchattaka-tree covered with blossom, and picked one of 
the flowers. His retinue followed his example, and soon the tree was quite bare. 
On his return from the park he observed this, and also how another tree near by, 
devoid of flowers, had been spared the spoilation. He thereupon reflected how 
possessions led to trouble, and, renouncing his kingdom, he donned the robes of 
a monk, later becoming a Pacceka Buddha. His udāna is included in the 
Khaggavisāna Sutta. SN.vs.64; SnA.i.116; ApA.i.161.</p>
