  <h2>Bhadd훮li Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached to Bhadd훮li (q.v.) when he confessed his fault. 
The monk, who believes in the Buddha and obeys his instructions, will ultimately 
understand dukkka and will bring it to an end. </p>
<p>The sutta also contains the parable of the Aj훮niya horse. 
A horse, schooled by an expert trainer and put through the various stages of 
training, becomes endowed with ten qualities, and is fit to be regarded as a 
treasure by a king. Similarly, a man who has developed the Noble Eightfold Path 
and obtained right knowledge and right deliverance, becomes the richest field in 
which the seed of merit may be sown. M.i.437ff.</p>
