  <h2>Punnapāti Jātaka (No. 53)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once Treasurer of Benares, and some 
rogues, wishing to rob him of his money, conspired together and drugged some 
liquor, which they offered him as he was on his way to the palace. The Treasurer 
suspected them, and promised to join them on his way back from the palace. But 
on his return the vessels which contained the liquor were still quite full; he 
therefore charged the men with the intent to poison him, or they would have 
drunk some of the liquor during his absence. They then ran away.</p>
<p>The story was told to Anāthapindika, who had a similar 
experience. But in this case he was returning from the palace, and challenged 
the rogue’s to taste their own liquor first. J.i.268 ff.</p>
