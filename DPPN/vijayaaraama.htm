<p>A garden in Anurādhapura, through which the boundary of 
the Mahāvihāra passed (Mbv. p. 136). </p>
<p>A monastery was built there (probably later), which came 
to be called the Vijayārāma-vihāra. Once, an arahant 
monk, teaching a kammatthāna to two monks, spoke of samuddha instead of samudda. 
One of the monks pointed out his error, and was sent by the arahant to the 
Mahāvihāra with a message that he had paid more attention to letters than to 
their meaning. The monk went to the Mahāvihāra and later attained Nibbāna, after 
solving various difficult questions in the presence of the assembly. MA.ii.827.</p>
