<p>Son of Ajātasattu. When Ajātasattu, 
after the death of his father, paid his first visit to the Buddha and saw the 
Buddha seated amidst the monks in a scene of perfect calm and silence, his first 
thought was: “Would that my son, Udāyibhadda, might have such calm as this.” 
(D.i.50). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.153) this 
thought by saying that Ajātasattu feared that his son might follow his own 
example and kill him as he had killed his own father. His fears were justified, 
for he was killed by his son Udāyibhadda, who reigned for sixteen years. 
</p>
<p>The latter, in his turn, was killed by 
his son Anuruddhaka (Mhv.iv.1ff. According to Dvy. his son was Munda). 
</p>
<p>It was in Udāyibhadda’s eighth year that 
Vijaya, king of Ceylon, died, and in his fifteenth year that Panduvasudeva came 
to the throne (Sp.i.72). The Dīpavamsa (iv.38; v.97; xi.8) calls him Udaya and 
the Mahābodhivamsa (p.96), Udayabhadda. See also Kālāsoka.</p>
