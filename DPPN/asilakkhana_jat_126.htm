<p>In <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> was a brahmin who could tell, 
by smelling them, whether swords were lucky or not. One day, while testing a 
sword, he sneezed and cut off the tip of his nose. The king had a false tip made 
and fastened to his nose so that no one could tell the difference.</p>
<p>The king had a daughter and an adopted 
nephew, who, when they grew up, fell deeply in love with each other. They wished 
to marry, but the king, having other plans, kept them apart. The prince bribed 
an old woman to get his beloved for him. The old woman reported to the king that 
his daughter was under the influence of witchcraft and that the only way of 
curing her was to take her to the cemetery under armed escort, where she must be 
laid on a bed under which was a corpse, and there she must be bathed for the 
purpose of exorcism.</p>
<p>The prince was to impersonate the 
corpse, being provided with pepper in order that he might sneeze at the right 
moment; the guard were warned that if the exorcism succeeded, the dead body 
would sneeze, rise up and kill the first thing it could lay hold of. The plot 
succeeded, the guard taking to their heels when the prince sneezed. The two 
lovers were married and were forgiven by the king. Later, they became king and 
queen.</p>
<p>One day the sword-testing brahmin was 
standing in the sun when the false tip of his nose melted and fell off. He stood 
hanging his head for very shame. “Never mind,” laughed the king, “sneezing is 
bad for some, but good for others. A sneeze lost you your nose, but a sneeze won 
for me both my throne and my queen.”</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
brahmin of the kingdom of Kosala who tested swords by smelling them. He accepted 
bribes and passed the swords only of those who had won his favour. One day an 
exasperated dealer put pepper on his sword so that when the brahmin smelt it he 
sneezed, slitting his nose. The monks were once talking about him when the 
Buddha entered and told them the story of the past. The two brahmins were one 
and the same man in different births. J.i.455-8.</p>
