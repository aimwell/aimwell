<p><b>1. Ceti, Cetiya.</b>-One of the sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a> (A.i.213, etc.), probably identical with Cedi of the older 
documents (E.g., Rv.viii.5, 37-9). The people of Ceti seem to have had two 
distinct settlements: one, perhaps the older, was in the mountains, probably the 
present Nepal (Bud. India, p.26). It is evidently this older settlement which is 
mentioned in the <a href="vessantara_jat_547.htm" title="vy/vessantara_jat_547.htm">Vessantara Jātaka</a>; it was passed by Vessantara on his way into 
exile in the Himalayas, and was thirty yojanas distant from Jetuttara (J.vi.514, 
518). The other, probably a later colony, lay near the Yamunā, to the east, in 
the neighbourhood of and contiguous to the settlement of the Kurus; for we are 
told (Vin.iv.108f; J.i.360f) that the Buddha, having dwelt in the Ceti country, 
went to Bhaddavatikā, where, at the Ambatittha, Sāgata tamed a Nāga, and from 
there he went to Kosambī. This part of the country corresponds roughly to the 
modern Bundelkhand and the adjoining region (Law: Geog. of Early Bsm., p.16).</p>
<p>It was probably of the older Ceti that 
Sotthivatī was the capital, where once reigned <a href="apacara.htm" title="ay/apacara.htm">Apacara</a>, who uttered the first 
lie in the world. (J.iii.454ff Sotthivati is probably identical with Suktimati 
or Sukti-Sāhvaya of the Mahābhārata (iii.20, 50; xiv.83, 2); see also PHAI.81).
</p>
<p>The journey from <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> to Ceti lay 
through a forest which was infested by robbers (J.i.253, 256). The settlement of 
Ceti was an important centre of Buddhism, even in the time of the Buddha. The 
Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.355f; v.41f; 157ff) mentions several discourses preached 
to the Cetis, while the Buddha dwelt in their town of Sahajāti. While dwelling 
in the Pācīnavamsadāya in the Ceti country, Anuruddha became an arahant after a 
visit which the Buddha paid to him (A.iv.228; see also Vin.i.300f). The 
Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.200 and passim) leads us to infer that the Buddha 
visited the Ceti country several times. The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.436f) records a 
discussion on the four Ariyan Truths among a number of monks, including 
Gavampati, dwelling at Sahajāti (v.l. Sahañcanika).</p>
<p>It is said (E.g., AA.ii.765) that the 
country was called Ceti because it was ruled by kings bearing the name of Ceti 
or Cetiya (SNA.i.135).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Cetiya.</b>-A mythical king (Mhv.ii.3; 
Dpv.iii.5; Mtu.i.348). See Ceti (1).  </p>
<p><a href="apacara.htm" title="ay/apacara.htm">Apacara</a> is also referred to as Cetiya (J.iii.457, 460, etc.), shortened into Cecca (J.v.267).</p>
