  <h2><b>Mahābyūha Sutta</b></h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Philosophers praise only themselves and their views, and 
disparage others. Their disputations cannot lead to purity. The true brahmin is 
he who has overcome all disputes and is confident in his knowledge. He is 
indifferent to learning, for he is calm and peaceful (SN.vss.895 914).  </p>
<p>The sutta 
was one of those preached on the occasion of the Mahāsamaya (SNA.ii.557), and is 
specially recommended for those inclined to confusion of mind (mohacaritānam).
