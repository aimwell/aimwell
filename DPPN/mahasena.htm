<p><b>1. Mahāsena. </b>A deva living in Ketumatī Palace to 
the east of Vejayanta. At the request of Sakka and of members of the Order, led 
by Assagutta, he was born in the world of men as Nāgasena. Mil. 6f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahāsena.</b> A brahmin, friend of Vanganta, father 
of Sāriputta. He was poor, and, out of compassion for him, Sāriputta came to his 
house for alms. Twice Mahāsena hid himself, having nothing to give, but, one 
day, receiving a bowl of rice porridge and a small piece of cloth, he thought of 
Sāriputta. The Elder had just risen from a trance, and, becoming aware of 
Mahāsena’s desire, he visited him, and was given the porridge and the piece of 
cloth with a prayer from Mahāsena, “May I realize the Truth you have seen.” 
After death, Mahāsena was born as the novice and was called Vanavāsī Tissa. 
DhA.ii.84.</p>

<p><b>3. Mahāsena.</b> Younger son of King Gothābhaya. He 
became king of Ceylon (334<span lang="en-us">-361 
A.C.), and under the advice of his teacher Sanghamitta and his minister Sona, he 
despoiled Mahāvihāra and enriched Abhayagiri. He issued a decree that no one 
should give alms to the monks of Mahāvihāra. But, later, his friend and 
minister, Meghavannābhaya, convinced him of his error, and he became a supporter 
of Mahāvihāra. Soon after, however, he fell under the influence of a monk, named 
Tissa, and built Jetavanaviharā in the precincts of Mahāvihāra, despite the 
protests of the monks. Tissa was later expelled from the Order. The king built 
the Manihīra, Gokanna, Erakāvilla, Kalandagāma, Migagāma, Gangāsenakapabbata, 
Dhātusenapabbata, Kokavāta, Rūpārāma, and Hulapitthi vihāras and two nunneries&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Uttara and Abhaya. He also built sixteen tanks and a great canal called 
Pabbatanta. (Dpv.xxii.66 76; Mhv.xxxvii.1ff).</p>
<p>Sirimeghavanna was the son of Mahāsena. Cv.xxxvii.53.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mahāsena.</b> A king of India who ruled in 
Pātaliputta. He fed one thousand monks daily; but, not satisfied with that, he 
went to Uttaramadhurā, where he labored in disguise, giving alms with the wages 
so earned. Cv.xcii.23ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Mahāsena</b>.A king of Pātaliputta. 
He and his sister worked with their own hands and gave alms to 500 monks from 
Piyangudīpa, among whom was Mahāsīva (8). The monk wished that they should see 
their alms being eaten by the monks in Piyangudīpa. Ras.i.72f.</p>
