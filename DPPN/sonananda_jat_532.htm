  <h2>Sona-Nanda Jātaka (No. 532)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once when Manoja was king of Brahmavaddhana (Benares), the 
Bodhisatta was born as Sona, the son of a rich brahmin. He had a brother Nanda. 
When the boys grew up their parents wanted them to marry, but they refused, and 
declared their desire to become ascetics after the death of their parents. Then 
the parents suggested that they should all, at once, become ascetics; this they 
did, and lived in a pleasant grove in the Himālaya. After some time, because 
Nanda brought unripe fruit for his parents in spite of Sona’s warning, Sona 
dismissed him. Nanda thereupon sought Manoja, and, with his magic power, helped 
him to win various kingdoms in Jambudīpa, bringing into subjection one hundred 
and one kings in seven years, seven months and seven days. All these kings 
Manoja brought to Brahmavaddhana, where he caroused with them. Nanda spent his 
time in the Suvannaguhā in the Himālaya, obtaining his alms from Uttarakuru. At 
the end of the seventh day Manoja looked for Nanda, who, reading his thoughts, 
appeared before him. Manoja wished to give some token of his gratitude, and 
Nanda asked that he should intercede for him with Sona and win for him Sona’s 
forgiveness. Together they went to Sona accompanied by a large retinue. Sona 
explained why he had forbidden Nanda, to look after their parents, and Nanda 
asked his forgiveness for having given his parents unripe fruit in his eagerness 
to wait on them. Sona forgave him, and they all lived together once more, while 
the kings returned to their countries, where they ruled wisely.</p>
<p>The occasion for the story is the same as that for the 
Sāma Jātaka (q.v.), regarding a monk who supported his mother. Nanda is 
identified with Ānanda and Manoja with Sāriputta (J.v.312, p.332).</p>
<p>The story is also given in the Cariyapitaka. Cyp.iii.v.</p>
