<p>The pupil of a “bamboo acrobat” (candālavamsika) (See 
KS.v.148, n.3) of long ago. His master called to him one day and asked him to 
climb the bamboo and to stand on his shoulder. Then the master suggested that 
they should watch and look after each other during their performances. But 
Medakathalikā said that each should look after himself, which would be the 
better way. </p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.iii.182) adds that, in this 
performance, the end of the pole rests on the forehead or throat. The man who 
thus holds it must watch the balance closely and not attend to the man at the 
end of the pole.</p>
<p>The Buddha related this story at Desakā, in the Sumbha 
country, to the monks, and said that, in the same way, each monk should look 
after himself; by guarding oneself, one guards another; this is done by the 
cultivation of the four satipatthānas (S.v.168f).</p>
<p>The name Medakathalikā, though feminine in inflection, is 
used for a male (SA.iii.181).</p>
