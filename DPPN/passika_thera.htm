<p>A brahmin of Kosala who, after seeing the Twin Miracle, 
entered the Order. He fell ill, but was attended and cured by his own people. 
Putting forth great energy, he became an arahant, and, travelling through the 
air to his kinsmen, he converted them.</p>
<p>In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a householder and 
gave the Buddha some pilakkha fruits (Thag.vs.240 42; ThagA.i.355). He is 
probably identical with Pilakkhaphaladāyaka Thera of 
the Apadāna. Ap.i.296; cp.ii.410.</p>
