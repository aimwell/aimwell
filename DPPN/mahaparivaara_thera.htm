<p>An arahant. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a Yakkha 
chief and, seeing the Buddha enter Bandhumatī with a large following of monks, 
offered his upper garment and worshipped him. The earth trembled with the force 
of his wish. Fifteen kappas ago he was king sixteen times under the name of 
Vāhana (Ap.i.146f). He is probably identical with Pakkha Thera. ThagA.i.144f.</p>
