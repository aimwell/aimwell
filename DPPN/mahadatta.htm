<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahādatta.</b> A thera of Ariyakotiya. He was once 
sitting at the foot of a tree to meditate, but because of the great power of his 
virtue, the children of the tree deity grew restless, and the deity tried to 
frighten him away but failed. She then appeared before the Thera, in disguise 
and told him of her trouble. He asked her to take her family somewhere else for 
that day only as he did not wish it to be thought that she had seared him away. 
MA.i.131.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahādatta Thera.</b> An incumbent of Hankanaka who 
wrongly believed that he was an arahant because of the in-operation of the 
corruptions. Vsm.634; Vibhā.489.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahādatta.</b> An Elder of Moravāpi, an eminent 
commentator whose opinions are quoted in the Commentaries. E.g., DhSA. 230, 267, 
284, 286; PSA. 405.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mahādatta.</b> A senāpati. He was a follower of the 
brāhmanas, and at the moment of his death he saw before him a picture of hell. 
The brahmins who were round him asked him what he saw, and he said that he saw a 
house blood red in colour. They assured him that that was the Brahma world, but 
after death he was born in hell. MA.ii.803.</p>
