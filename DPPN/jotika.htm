<p><b>1. Jotika, Jotiya.</b>-A treasurer of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">RÄjagaha</a> who later became an arahant. In the past he had been a householder of 
Benares who, with his elder brother, owned a field of sugar-cane. One day, when 
returning from the field with some stalks of sugar-cane, he saw a 
<a href="pacceka_buddha.htm" title="pa/pacceka_buddha.htm">Pacceka Buddha</a> 
from <a href="gandhamaadana.htm" title="g/gandhamaadana.htm">GandhamÄdana</a> to whom he gave a bowl full of sugar-cane juice for him to 
drink, and when he had drunk it, gave him another bowlful which the Pacceka 
Buddha took to GandhamÄdana to share with his colleagues. The householder, when 
proffering his gifts, wished for glory and for NibbÄna. His elder brother, 
hearing of this, was likewise filled with joy and he, too, wished for NibbÄna. 
 
</p>
<p>In the time of VipassÄ« Buddha they were again brothers in a rich family of BandhumatÄ«, the elder being called Sena and the younger AparÄjita. Sena entered 
the Order and became an arahant. At his suggestion, AparÄijita (According to 
DhA.iii.364, both uncle and nephew were called Avaroja) built for the Buddha a 
very costly Gandhakuti, with the seven kinds of precious things. His nephew, 
also called AparÄjita, built an elephant stable in front of the Gandhakuti and 
was reborn in this age as <a href="mendaka.htm" title="me_mu/mendaka.htm">Mendaka</a>. The Gandhakuti and its surroundings 
contained all kinds of luxuries and splendours beyond description. (For details 
see DhA.iv.203f). Within and without the chamber he caused jewels, pounded and 
otherwise, to be strewn knee deep. Those who came to listen to the Buddha went 
away, their hands full of jewels. One day a brahmin tried to carry away a very 
costly jewel, which much annoyed Aparàjita. On mentioning it to the Buddha, the 
Buddha taught him to make a wish that his property should not be taken away by 
thieves or lost by fire or water. For nine months AparÄjita held the ceremony of 
dedication of the Gandhakuti.</p>
<p>In this age he was born as the son of a 
setthi in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">RÄjagaha</a>. On the day of his birth the whole city became one blaze of 
light, hence his name, Jotika. The king, <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">BimbisÄra</a>, gave one thousand a day for 
his milk-money. When the time came for his marriage, <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> provided for him a 
palace, seven storeys high, made entirely of precious minerals. Four urns of 
treasure stood at the four corners and four stalks of sugar-cane made of solid 
gold, each the size of a palmyra tree with leaves of precious stones, to remind 
Jotika of his good deed in the past. Seven Yakkhas guarded the seven gates â€” 
YamakolÄ«, Uppala, Vajira, VajirabÄhu, Kasakanda, Katattha and DisÄpÄmukha â€” each 
with numerous followers. BimbisÄra, hearing of his splendour, appointed Jotika 
to the rank of setthi.</p>
<p>The gods brought him a wife from 
<a href="uttarakuru.htm" title="u/uttarakuru.htm">Uttarakuru</a> and lodged her in an apartment in Jotikaâ€™s palace. Her name was 
<a href="satulakayi.htm" title="sa/satulakayi.htm">SatulakÄyÄ«</a> (DhA.iv.223). She brought with her a pint-pot of rice and three 
crystal fire-stones. Whenever they wished to eat, they would put rice over the 
boiler and set it over the crystals. The stones would immediately become alight 
and, when the meal was cooked, would extinguish themselves. The pot was 
inexhaustible. All who came to visit Jotika were provided with food and were 
allowed to take anything they wished from the treasure, the treasure never 
growing less. So great were the crowds which flocked to Jotikaâ€™s palace that for 
a long time BimbisÄra had no chance of seeing it. When BimbisÄra did in the end 
visit him with AjÄtasattu, Jotika invited him to a meal which was the most 
dainty the king had ever tasted. After the meal Jotika presented his wife to 
BimbisÄra; so delicately was she nurtured that the perfume with which the king 
was scented hurt her eyes! There were no lamps in Jotikaâ€™s house; only the light 
of jewels was made use of, and as a memento of BimbisÄraâ€™s visit Jotika gave him 
a huge jewel to be used as a lamp. (This account is taken from DhA.iv.199-213).</p>
<p>Jotika was a very pious follower of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. Once, when he was away listening to the Buddhaâ€™s preaching, 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">AjÄtasattu</a> â€” 
who even when visiting the palace as a boy with his father had coveted Jotikaâ€™s 
wealth â€” went with his soldiers to attack the palace in an attempt to take 
possession of it. But the Yakkha YamakolÄ« routed the army, and AjÄtasattu fled 
for refuge to the vihÄra where Jotika was listening to the Dhamma. On being 
charged by AjÄtasattu with hypocrisy in that he was there listening to the 
Dhamma, after having charged his guards to set upon the king, Jotikaâ€™s answer 
was that he had no need of guards since nobody could take anything of his 
without his sanction. He then challenged the king to remove the rings from his (Jotikaâ€™s) 
fingers. AjÄtasattu, trying with all his might, failed. Jotika then held out his 
hands and his rings all fell off. Agitated by the kingâ€™s desire to possess his 
wealth, Jotika asked for permission to become a monk. AjÄtasattu agreed, hoping 
thus to get possession of his riches. Jotika entered the Order and soon became 
an arahant, but at the moment of his attainment of arahantship all his wealth 
and earthly glory vanished and his wife returned to Uttarakuru (DhA.iv.221-4).
</p>
<p>Jotika is included among the five 
persons who possessed great merit and had puÃ±Ã±iddhi.</p>
<p>DhA.i.385; Vsm.383; PsA.502. These five 
persons are described as amitabhogÄ (AA.i.220).</p>

<p><b>2. Jotika.</b>-A householder of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">RÄjagaha</a> and 
father of <a href="diighaavu.htm" title="d/diighaavu.htm">DÄ«ghÄvu</a>. When DÄ«ghÄvu fell ill he sent Jotika to tell the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (S.v.344f).</p>
