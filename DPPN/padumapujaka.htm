<h4>1. Padumapūjaka Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Ninety one kappas ago he lived in Romasa, near 
Himavā, and offered a lotus to the Pacceka Buddha Sambhava (Ap.i.279f.; see also 
Padumadhāriya). In the Theragāthā Commentary (i.399) his verses are attributed 
to Sappaka Thera, and it is said there that in the time of Sambhava he was a 
Nāga king.</p>

<h4>2. Padumapūjaka Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Ninety one kappas ago he was an ascetic in 
Gotama, near Himavā, and, together with his pupils, he called to mind the 
Buddha’s virtues and offered lotuses in his name. Fifty one kappas ago he was a 
king named Jaluttama (Ap.i.162f). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Mendasira. ThagA.i.172.</p>
