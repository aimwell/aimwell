<p>A village in the Cetiya country near 
Bhaddavatikā. When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by 
the cowherds not to go to Ambatittha as in the Jatila’s hermitage in the village 
dwelt a mighty Nāga. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata 
went to the Jatila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The 
Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his 
iddhi-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him 
to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and 
the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank 
wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha. The latter made 
this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pācittiya-offence.
