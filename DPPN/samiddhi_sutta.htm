<p><b>1. Samiddhi Sutta.</b> The story of a nymph who tried 
to tempt Samiddhi Thera. The story is similar to the introductory story of the 
Samiddhi Jātaka, but the discussion between Samiddhi and the devatā is given at 
greater length. When Samiddhi told her of his aim in leading the religious life, 
she wished to know more of the Buddha’s teaching, and asked him to find an 
opportunity for her to see the Buddha. This Samiddhi did, and the Buddha 
preached to her. S.i.8 ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Samiddhi Sutta.</b> Describes the unsuccessful 
attempt of Māra to frighten Samiddhi Thera (q.v.). Māra made a tremendous noise 
near him, and Samiddhi sought the Buddha’s advice. The Buddha explained to him 
that the noise was made by Māra, and the next time he came Samiddhi challenged 
him to do his worst. S.i.119 f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Samiddhi Sutta.</b> Preached at the Kalandakanivāpa 
in Veluvana, in answer to Samiddhi’s question as to what Māra is and what are 
his distinguishing qualities. S.iv.38f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Samiddhi Sutta.</b> Records a lesson given by 
Sāriputta to Samiddhi on sankappavitakkā (purposive thoughts). A.iv.385 f.</p>
