<p>A hill near <a href="gayaa.htm" title="g/gayaa.htm">Gayā</a>. Here the Buddha came 
from <a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a> after converting the
<a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Tebhātika-Jatilā</a>, and here he lived with one 
thousand monks. On this occasion of his coming he preached the 
<a href="aadittapariyaaya_s.htm" title="aa/aadittapariyaaya_s.htm">Adittapariyāya 
Sutta</a> (Vin.i.34f; S.iv.19f; J.i.82; AA.i.57, etc.; PvA.21; Ud.i.9; DhA.i.72). 
 
</p>
<p>When <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> managed to win over five hundred of the monks to his side, it was 
to Gayāsīsa that he retired with them, and there it was that the Buddha’s Chief 
Disciples had to go to reclaim them (Vin.ii.199; DhA.i.121; J.i.142, 425, 490f; 
iv.180). It is said (J.i.185, 508; ii.38f) that <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> built a special 
monastery for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa.</p>
<p>The Commentaries (SA.iii.4; UdA.74) say 
that the hill was so called because it was composed of a flat stone and was 
shaped like an elephant’s head (gaja-sīsa-sadisa-pitthipāsāno). There was room 
on the rock for one thousand monks.  </p>
<p>The hill stands about one mile to the 
south-west of Gayā and is now called Brahmayoni. To the south-east of the hill 
<a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a> saw the three thūpas of the Tebhātika Jatilā (CAGI.524f).  </p>
