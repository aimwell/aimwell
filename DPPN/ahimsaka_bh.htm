<p>One of the 
<a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja</a> brothers. He came 
to the Buddha at <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> and the Buddha suggested to him the desirability of 
living up to his name by practising <a href="ahimsaka_bh.htm" title="am/ahimsaka_bh.htm">ahimsā</a>. It is said that later he became an 
arahant (S.i.164). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (SA.i.179) is uncertain as 
to the reason for the name which he says was given to him by the Recensionists. 
He suggests that he was so called, either because his actual name was such, or 
because of the nature of the discussion between him and the Buddha.</p>
