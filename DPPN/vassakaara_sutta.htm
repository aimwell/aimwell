<p><b>1. Vassakāra Sutta.</b> Vassakāra visits the Buddha at 
Veluvana and tells him that, among brahmins, a man is considered great and wise 
if </p>
<ul>
  <li>he understands a thing as soon as uttered, </li>
  <li>has a good memory, </li>
  <li>is skilled and diligent in business, </li>
  <li>and resourceful and capable in investigation. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha mentions four other qualities of greatness:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>to be given up to the welfare of many, </li>
  <li>to be master of the mind in the domain of thought (cetovasippatta),
  </li>
  <li>to be able to enter into the four jhānas at will,
  </li>
  <li>to have comprehended Nibbāna by the destruction of the 
  āsavas. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha acknowledges, in answer to Vassakāra’s 
question, that he himself possesses these four qualities. A.ii.35f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vassakāra Sutta.</b> Vassakāra visits the Buddha at 
Veluvana and asks him a series of questions. The Buddha, in answer, says that a 
bad man cannot, as a good man can, recognize either a good man or a bad man as 
such. Vassakāra then relates how, once, the followers of the brahmin Todeyya 
spoke ill of Eleyya and his retinue for showing homage to Rāmaputta; he now 
understands why they honour Rāmaputta; it is because he is wiser than they. 
A.ii.179f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vassakāra Sutta. </b>Vassakāra visits the Buddha at 
Gijjhakūta, at the request of Ajātasattu, and tells him of the latter’s desire 
to destroy the Vajjians. The Buddha tells him that as long as the Vajjians 
practise the seven conditions of welfare, taught by him at Sārandada, cetiya 
they will not decline, but rather prosper. Ajātasattu can achieve victory, not 
by battle, but by causing disunity. A.iv.17ff.; cf. D.ii.72f.</p>
