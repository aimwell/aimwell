<p>The story of the son of a career. His 
father was a heretic, but he, while playing with a Buddhist lad, had learnt to 
say “Praise be to the Buddha.” One day he went with his father on a journey, and 
as his father got locked into the city at sunset, he had to spend the night all 
alone under the cart outside the walls of Rājagaha. During the night, two 
Yakkhas tried to eat him, but in his dream he whispered “Praise be to the 
Buddha” and was saved. The king, hearing the story, repeated it to the Buddha.
