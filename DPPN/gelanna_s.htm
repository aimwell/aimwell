<p>1. Gelañña Sutta.-The Buddha, staying at 
the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, visits the sick ward in the evening and talks to the 
sick monks. A monk, he tells them, should meet his end collected and composed. 
He should put away the dejection arising from craving. In whatever he does, he 
should act composedly. So composed and collected, he becomes free from bondage. 
When his body breaks up, he understands the matter and is prepared for it, for 
it is like a lamp which goes out when oil and wick are exhausted. S.iv.210f.</p>
<p>2. Gelañña Sutta.-The topic is the same 
as in the above, but the wording differs. S.iv.213f.</p>
