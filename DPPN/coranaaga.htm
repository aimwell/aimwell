<p>King of Ceylon (3 B.C.-9 A.C.). He was 
the son of Vattagāmani and his name was Mahānāga (Mhv.xxxiii.45). During the 
reign of Mahācūli Mahātissa he was a rebel and came to the throne after 
Mahācūli’s death. He destroyed eighteen vihāras which had refused to shelter him 
as a rebel. He was poisoned by his queen Anulā (Mhv.xxxiv.11ff). It is said
