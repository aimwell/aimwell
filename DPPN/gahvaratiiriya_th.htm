<p>He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi, named 
Aggidatta. Having seen Yamakapātihāriya, he entered the Order and lived in a 
spot called Gahvaratīra — hence his name — and there in due course became an 
arahant. On his return to Sāvatthi, his relations held a great almsgiving in his 
honour and requested him to live near them. But be refused this request and 
returned to the forest.</p>
<p>He was a hunter in the time of Sikhī 
Buddha, and was delighted by the sound of the Buddha’s voice as he preached 
(Thag.v.31; ThagA.i.91).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Ghosasaññaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.451), but the same verses are also attributed 
to Dhammika. ThagA.i.398.</p>
