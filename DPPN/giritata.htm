<p>A tank built by Aggabodhi II 
(Cv.xlii.67).  </p>
<p>Near it was the village of the same name, where Parakkamabāhu I. 
once encamped with his army (Cv.lxx.312).  </p>
<p>There the monks interviewed him on 
behalf of Gaja-bāhu and persuaded him to restore to the latter his kingdom 
(Cv.lxx.329f).  </p>
<p>Later, the village was occupied by Mānābharana and his army 
(Cv.lxxii.149).  </p>
<p>The tank was among those repaired by 
<a href="parakkamabahu.htm" title="pa/parakkamabahu.htm">Parakkamabāhu I</a>., and from 
there he carried the canal <a href="kaaveri.htm" title="ka/kaaveri.htm">Kāverī</a>, thus joining 
<a href="giritata.htm" title="g/giritata.htm">Giritata</a> to the 
<a href="kadduuravaddhamaana.htm" title="ka/kadduuravaddhamaana.htm">Kaddūravaddhamāna</a> tank. (Cv.lxxix.33, 55; see also Cv.Trs.i.312, n.3; 334 n.1).</p>
