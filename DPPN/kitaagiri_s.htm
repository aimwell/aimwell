  <h2>Kitāgiri Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Preached at Kitāgiri to the 
Assajipunabbasukā, who were reported to the Buddha as having ridiculed the idea 
that they should themselves have only one meal a day because the Buddha and his 
devoted disciples did so. The Buddha sent for them and impressed on them that 
all his teachings were based on experience and knowledge and should therefore be 
followed by them. Chaffering such as their’s was not seemly in the seeker after 
truth (M.i.473ff).</p>
