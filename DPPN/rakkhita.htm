<p><b>1. Rakkhita Thera. </b>He was born in a noble Sākyan family of 
Vedehanigama (? Devadaha) and was one of the five hundred youths given by the 
Sākyan and Koliyan chiefs to provide an escort to the Buddha, as an 
acknowledgement of his having prevented war between them. When the Buddha 
preached the <a href="kunaala_jat_536.htm" title="ku/kunaala_jat_536.htm">Kunāla Jātaka</a>, Rakkhita, realizing the dangers of sensuality, 
developed insight, and later became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he heard the Buddha preach and praised his 
eructation (Thag.79; ThagA.i.173). He is evidently identical with Sobhita Thera 
of the Apadāna. Ap.i.163f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Rakkhita Thera. </b>He was sent to the  
<a href="vanavaasa.htm" title="va/vanavaasa.htm">Vanavāsa</a> country to convert it 
at the end of the Third Council. Floating in the air amid the people, he 
preached the <a href="anamatagga_sam.htm" title="ay/anamatagga_sam.htm">Anamatagga Samyutta</a>. Sixty thousand people embraced the new 
religion and thirty seven thousand joined the Order, five hundred vihāras being 
founded. Mhv.xii.4, 31ff.; Dpv.viii.7; Sp.i.63, 66.</p>
