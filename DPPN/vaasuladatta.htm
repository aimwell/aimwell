<p>A Nāga of Mañjerikabhavana. He was the nephew of Mahākāla, 
and when Sonuttara went to the Nāga world to obtain the Buddha’s relics for the 
Mahā Thūpa, Mahākāla signed to Vāsuladatta to hide them. Vāsuladatta assumed a 
huge Nāga form, three hundred leagues long, with a head one league in extent, 
and having swallowed the casket containing the relics, lay down at the foot of 
Sineru. But Sonuttara, by his iddhi power, put his hand into the Nāga’s stomach 
and removed the invisible relics. Mhv.xxxi.52ff.</p>
