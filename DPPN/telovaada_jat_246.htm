<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a brahmin 
ascetic. He came to a village for alms and was invited by a wealthy brahmin who, 
after having given him food with fish, tried to annoy him by saying that the 
fish had been killed specially for him. The Bodhisatta said that he himself was 
entirely free from blame.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Nigantha Nātaputta who sneered because the Buddha had consented to eat at the 
house of the general Sīha. The wealthy brahmin is identified with Nātaputta. 
J.ii.262f.</p>
