<p>1. Mānavamma. See Māna, Nos. 2 and 3.</p>

<p>2. Mānavamma. Elder brother of Māna (Māna 2) and son of 
Kassapa II. Once, as he made an incantation, the god Kumāra appeared before him, 
riding his peacock; the bird, finding nothing to drink, flew at Mānavamma’s 
face. He, thereupon, offered the peacock his eye, of which the bird drank. 
Kumāra promised him the fulfilment of his wish, but he did not aspire to royal 
power, and retired in favour of his younger brother Māna. Cv.lvii.5ff.</p>
