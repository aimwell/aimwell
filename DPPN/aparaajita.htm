<p>1. Aparājita.-One of the Pacceka Buddhas 
mentioned in the Isigili Sutta. M.iii.70; also ApA.i.107 and MA.ii.890.</p>
<p>2. Aparājita.-A cakkavatti who lived 
seven kappas ago, an earlier birth of Avyādhika Thera. Ap.i.215.</p>
<p>3. Aparājita.-A householder of 
Bandhumatī. When his elder brother, Sena, left the world and became an arahant 
under Vipassī Buddha, Aparājita sought his advice as to how he could use his 
wealth to perform some act of great merit. He was asked to build a Gandhakuti 
for the Buddha, which he did, using all manner of precious metals and stones and 
surrounding it with various kinds of luxury, such as perfumed water. The chamber 
was on three occasions filled knee-deep with jewels to be taken by anyone who 
came to hear the Buddha preach. At the opening of the Gandhakuti, Aparājita 
entertained 6,800,000 monks for nine months. In this age he was born as the 
banker Jotika. In an earlier birth he had given sugar-cane to a Pacceka Buddha. 
DhA.iv.199-207.</p>
<p>4. Aparājita.-Nephew of the foregoing. 
He asked his uncle to let him have a share in the building of the Gandhakuti, 
but was refused. So he built an elephant stable next to it.</p>
<p>In the present age he was the banker 
Mendaka. DhA.iv.203.</p>
