<p>A mountain in Ceylon. A story connected 
with it is given in the Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.112-13; DhsA.103).  </p>
<p>A farmer, 
who had taken the precepts from Pingala Buddharakkhita of Ambariyavih훮ra, lost a 
bull while ploughing. In looking for it he came to this mountain, where he was 
seized by a large snake. He was strongly tempted to kill the snake, but 
honouring his vows, he refrained. The snake left him. v.l. Uttaravad째.</p>
