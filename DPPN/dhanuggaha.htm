  <h2>Dhanuggaha Sutta</h2>

<p>A man, who can simultaneously seize the 
arrows shot by four expert bowmen from the four quarters, is possessed of great 
speed. Far speedier than he are the sun and the moon, but the change taking 
place in all things surpasses all these in speed (S.i.265).</p>
<p>This seems also to have been called the 
Dalhadhamma Sutta. E. g., at J.iv.211.</p>
