  <h2>Samitigutta Thera</h2>
  </li>

<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and entered 
the Order after hearing the Buddha preach. He attained to entire purity of 
conduct, but, because of some action in his former life, was attacked by 
leprosy, and his limbs gradually decayed. He therefore lived in the infirmary. 
One day Sāriputta, while visiting the sick, saw him and gave him an exercise on 
contemplation of feeling. Practising this, Samitigutta developed insight and 
became an arahant. Then he remembered his past action and uttered a verse 
(Thag.vs.81).</p>
<p>In the past he was a householder and offered jasmine 
flowers to Vipassī Buddha. In another birth he saw a Pacceka Buddha and insulted 
him, calling him a “leprous starveling” and spitting in his presence. For this 
he suffered long in hell, and was reborn on earth in the time of Kassapa Buddha. 
He became a Paribbājaka, and, losing his temper with a follower of the Buddha, 
cursed him&nbsp;&nbsp; “May you become a leper.” He also soiled the bath powders 
placed by people at bathing places; hence his affliction in the present age 
(ThagA.i.175 f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Jātipūjaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.154.</p>
