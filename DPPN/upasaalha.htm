  <h2>Upasālha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A wealthy brahmin of Rājagaha. He lived 
near the monastery, but was an unbeliever and had nothing to do with the Buddha 
or his monks. He had a wise and intelligent son. When Upasālha was old, he told 
his son that, after death, he wished to be burnt in a cemetery unpolluted by any 
outcast. Being asked by the son to point out such a spot, he took him to 
Gijjhakūta and showed him a place. As they were descending the hill, the Buddha, 
perceiving their upanissaya, waited for them at the foot, and when they met he 
asked where they had been. Having heard their story, he related the Upasālha 
Jātaka, showing that in the past, too, Upasālha had been fastidious about 
cemeteries. At the conclusion of the discourse, both father and son were 
established in the First Fruit of the Path. J.ii.54ff.</p>
