<p>A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.69; ApA.i.106). 
In a previous life, when Anuruddha was born as Annabhāra, he offered alms to the 
Pacceka Buddha and made various wishes which were fulfilled in later births 
(DhA.i.113f). Uparittha had spent seven days in meditation on Gandhamādana, and 
when he appeared before Annabhāra, the latter ran home to his wife, fetched the 
food which had been prepared for themselves and gave it to Uparittha. Uparittha 
ate the meal seated on Annabhāra’s garment, which was spread on the ground for 
him. AA.i.105; Thag.910; ThagA.ii.66.</p>
