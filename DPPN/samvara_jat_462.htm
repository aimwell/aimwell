<p>The Bodhisatta was the teacher of <a href="samvara.htm" title="sa/samvara.htm">Samvara</a> (1), youngest of 
the hundred sons of the king of Benares. When he had finished his studies, the 
king offered him a province, but, at the suggestion of his teacher, he preferred 
to live near his father. There, acting on the Bodhisatta’s advice, he won all 
hearts, and on the death of his father the courtiers made him king. The brothers 
protested, and Samvara, again following his teacher’s advice, divided his 
father’s wealth among them. Then his brothers, led by Uposatha, acknowledged him 
king.</p>
<p>The story was told to a monk who had dwelt in the forest 
and had then given up striving. He is identified with Samvara and Sāriputta with 
Uposatha. J.iv.130ff.; see also the <a href="aliinacitta_jat_156.htm" title="am/aliinacitta_jat_156.htm">Alinacitta Jātaka</a> and
