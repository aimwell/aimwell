<p>A mountain in Himavā to which Vessantara was banished with 
his family. </p>
<p>It was thirty leagues from the Ceta country and sixty 
leagues from Jetuttara, the way passing through Suvannagiritāla, over the river 
Kontimāra, through Arañjaragiri, Dunnivittha, northwards beyond Gandhamādana, 
over Mt. Vipula, across the Ketumatī River, through Mount Nālika and the 
Mucalinda Lake (Cyp.i.9; J.vi.514, 518, 519). </p>
<p>Vessantara and his family lived there in a hermitage built 
by Vissakimma at Sakka’s suggestion (J.vi.520). Sañjaya later built a road, 
eight usabhas wide, from Jetuttara to Vanka. J.vi.580.</p>
