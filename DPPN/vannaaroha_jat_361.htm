<p>Once a lion, Sudātha, and a tiger, Subāhu, who lived in a 
forest, became friends. A jackal, who lived on their leavings, wishing to make 
them quarrel, told each that the other spoke evil of him. The lion and tiger 
discovered his plot and he had to flee.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a man who lived on the 
broken food of Sāriputta and Moggallāna and tried to set them at variance with 
each other. The attempt failed and the man was driven away. He is identified 
with the jackal. J.iii.191ff.; cp. the Sandhibheda Jātaka.</p>
