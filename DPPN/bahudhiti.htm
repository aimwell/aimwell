<p>A brahmin of the Bhāradvājagotta who had seven widowed 
daughters and was much in debt. One day he lost fourteen oxen, and, after 
searching for them for six days, he came across the Buddha in a forest tract. He 
spoke the praises of the Buddha’s freedom, unperturbed by the anxieties to which 
he himself was a prey for the Buddha had no nagging wife, no creditors, no 
vermin disturbing his sleep. The Buddha agreed with him, and he was so pleased 
with the Buddha’s words that he asked to be ordained. The Buddha ordained him 
(S.i.170f ); the Commentary adds (SA.i.187ff), that he took the newly ordained 
to Pasenadi to whom he related what had happened. The king summoned the man’s 
creditors; and paid them off, and having sent for his wife and daughters he took 
them under his protection. The man soon after became an arahant.</p>
