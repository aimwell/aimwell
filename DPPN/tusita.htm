  <h2>Tusita</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>1. Tusita.-One of the palaces occupied 
by Konāgamana Buddha in his last lay life. Bu.xxiv.18.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Tusita.-The fourth of the six deva 
worlds (A.i.210, etc.). </p>
<p>Four hundred years of human life are 
equal to one day of the Tusita world and four thousand years, so reckoned, is 
the term of life of a deva born in Tusita (A.i.214; iv.261, etc.). </p>
<p>Sometimes Sakadāgāmins (e.g., Purāna and 
Isidatta) are born there (A.iii.348; v.138; also DhA.i.129; UdA.149, 277).
</p>
<p>It is the rule for all Bodhisattas to be 
born in Tusita in their last life but one; then, when the time comes for the 
appearance of a Buddha in the world, the devas of the ten thousand world systems 
assemble and request the Bodhisatta to be born among men. Great rejoicings 
attend the acceptance of this request (A.ii.130; iv.312; DhA.i.69f; J.i.47f).
</p>
<p>Gotama’s name, while in Tusita, was 
Setaketu (Sp.i.161), and the Bodhisatta Metteyya (q.v.), the future Buddha, is 
now living in Tusita under the name of Nathadeva. </p>
<p>The Tusita world is considered the most 
beautiful of the celestial worlds, and the pious love to be born there because 
of the presence of the Bodhisatta (Mhv.xxxii.72f). </p>
<p>Tusita is also the abode of each 
Bodhisatta’s parents (DhA.i.110). </p>
<p>The king of the Tusita world is 
Santusita; he excels his fellows in ten respects — beauty, span of life, etc. 
(A.iv.243; but see Cv.lii.47, where the Bodhisatta Metteyya is called the chief 
of Tusita). </p>
<p>Among those reborn in Tusita are also 
mentioned Dhammika, Anāthapindika, Mallikā, the thera Tissa (Tissa 10), 
Mahādhana and Dutthagāmani. </p>
<p>The Tusita devas are so-called because 
they are full of joy (tuttha-hatthāti Tusitā) (VibhA.519; NidA.109).</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Tusita are called 
Tusitā. They were present at the Mahāsamaya (D.ii.161).</p>
