<hr>
<p><b>4. Visākhā Therī.</b> She belonged to the harem of the 
Bodhisatta and left the world with <a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā 
Pajāpatī Gotamī</a>. She received a topic of 
meditation from the Buddha and in due course won arahantship. A verse uttered by 
her, admonishing her companions, is included in the Therīgāthā. Thig.vs.13; 
ThigA.20.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Visākhā</h4>
<p>The chief among the female lay disciples of the Buddha and 
declared by him to be foremost among those who ministered to the Order (dāyikānam 
aggā) (A.i.26; she is considered the ideal lay woman — 
e.g., A.iv.348). Her father was Dhanañjaya, son of Mendaka, and her mother 
Sumanā. She was born in the city of Bhaddiya in Anga. When she was seven years 
old, the Buddha visited Bhaddiya with a large company of monks, out of 
compassion for the brahmin Sela and others. Mendaka gave Visākhā five hundred 
companions, five hundred slaves, and five hundred chariots, that she might visit 
the Buddha. She stopped the chariots some distance away and approached the 
Buddha on foot. He preached to her and she became a sotāpanna. For the next 
fortnight Mendaka invited the Buddha and his monks daily to his house, where he 
fed them.</p>
<p>Later, when, at Pasenadi’s request, Bimbisāra sent 
Dhanañjaya to live in Kosala, Visākhā accompanied her parents and lived in 
Sāketa. The messengers, sent by Migāra of Sāvatthi to find a suitable bride for 
his son Paññavaddhana, saw Visākhā on her way to the lake to bathe on a feast 
day. At that moment there was a great shower. Visākhā’s companions ran for 
shelter, but Visākhā herself, walking at her usual pace, came to the place where 
the messengers, already greatly impressed, were awaiting her. When they asked 
her why she did not run to seek shelter and so preserve her clothes, she 
answered that she had plenty of clothes in the house, but that if she ran she 
might damage a limb which would be a great loss. “Unmarried girls,” she said, 
“are like goods awaiting sale, they must not be disfigured.” The messengers 
offered her a bouquet of flowers (mālāgulam), which she accepted as a proposal 
of marriage, and then went on to her father’s house. The messengers followed and 
laid Punnavaddhana’s suit before Dhanañjaya. The proposal was accepted and 
confirmed by an exchange of letters.</p>
<p>When Pasenadi heard of it, he offered to accompany 
Punnavaddhana to Sāketa, as a mark of signal favour. Dhanañjaya welcomed the 
king and his retinue, Migāra, Punnavaddhana and their followers, with all 
honour, attending personally to all the details of hospitality. He persuaded the 
king to stay with him during the rains, providing all that was necessary. 
According to the DhA. account (loc. cit.) Visākhā superintended all the 
arrangements.</p>
<p>Five hundred goldsmiths were engaged to make the 
<a href="mahalata_pasadhana.htm" title="maha/mahalata_pasadhana.htm">
Mahālatāpasādhana</a> (ornament), q.v., for the bride; three months passed, but it 
was still unfinished. The supply of firewood ran out, and orders were given that 
the wood of dilapidated houses should be used. This wood lasted for a fortnight, 
and then the storehouses containing cloths were opened, the cloths soaked in oil 
and used for cooking the food. The ornament was finished in four months. In the 
time of Kassapa Buddha she gave bowls and robes to twenty thousand monks, also 
thread and needles and sewing materials; as a result of this, she received her parure in this life (DhA.i.395).</p>
<p>Dhanañjaya gave his daughter, as dowry, five hundred carts 
full of money, five hundred with vessels of gold, five hundred each of silver, 
copper, various silks, ghee, rice husked and winnowed; also ploughs, 
ploughshares, and other farm implements, five hundred carts with three 
slave-women in each, everything being provided for them. The cattle given by him 
filled an enclosure three quarters of a league in length and eight rods across, 
standing shoulder to shoulder, and in addition to these, sixty thousand bulls 
and sixty thousand milk cows escaped from their stalls and joined the herd 
already gifted to her. In her birth as Sanghadāsi, she gave the five products of 
the cow to twenty thousand monks, begging them to eat; hence the escaping of the 
cattle for her benefit (DhA.i.397). Visākhā’s relations continued to send her 
costly gifts even after her marriage. The Udāna (ii.9) contains a story of a 
dispute she had with the customs officers regarding the duty they levied on one 
of her presents. She visited Pasenadi several times, trying to get the matter 
settled; but he had no time to give to the matter, and, in the end, she sought 
consolation from the Buddha.</p>
<p>When the time came for Visākhā to leave, Dhanañjaya gave 
her ten admonitions, which Migāra overheard from the next room. These 
admonitions were: Not to give fire from the house outside; not to take into the 
house fire from without; to give only to those who give in return: not to give 
to those who do not give in return; to give to him that gives and to him that 
gives not; to sit, eat and sleep happily; to tend the fire and to honour 
household deities. These riddles were later explained by Visākhā to her father 
in law (DhA.i.403f.).</p>
<p>On the following day Dhanañjaya appointed eight 
householders to be sponsors to his daughter and to enquire into any charges 
which might be brought against her. When she left, Dhanañjaya allowed any 
inhabitants of his fourteen tributary villages to accompany her if they so 
wished. As a result the villages were left empty; but Migāra, fearing that he 
should have to feed them, drove most of them back. Visākhā entered Sāvatthi 
standing in her chariot, so that all might see her glory. The citizens showered 
gifts on her, but these she distributed among the people.</p>
<p>Migāra was a follower of the Niganthas, and, soon after 
Visākhā’s arrival in his house, he sent for them and told her to minister to 
them. But Visākhā, repulsed by their nudity, refused to pay them homage. The 
Niganthas urged that she should be sent away, but Migāra bided his time. One 
day, as Migāra was eating, while Visākhā stood fanning him, a monk was seen 
standing outside his house. Visākhā stood aside, that Migāra might see him, but 
as Migāra continued to eat without noticing the monk, she said to the latter, 
“Pass on, Sir, my father in law eats stale fare.” Migāra was angry and 
threatened to send her away, but, at her request, the matter was referred to her 
sponsors. They enquired into the several charges brought against her and 
adjudged her not guilty. Visākhā then gave orders that preparations should be 
made for her return to her parents. But Migāra begged her forgiveness which she 
granted, on condition that he would invite to the house the Buddha and his 
monks. This he did, but, owing to the influence of the Niganthas, he left 
Visākhā to entertain them, and only consented to hear the Buddha’s sermon at the 
end of the meal from behind a curtain. At the conclusion of this sermon, 
however, he became a sotāpanna. His gratitude towards Visākhā was boundless; 
henceforth she was to be considered as his mother and to receive all the honour 
due to a mother; from this time onwards she was called Migāramātā. In DhA.i.406 
we are told that in order to confirm this declaration, Migāra sucked the breast 
of Visākhā. This account adds that she had also a son named Migāra; thus there 
was a double reason for the name. AA.i.313 says that Migāra was her eldest son.
</p>
<p>Migāra got made for her everyday use an ornament called 
ghanamatthaka, at a cost of one hundred thousand. (Some time after, Visākhā sold 
the Matālatāpasādhana and built the Migāramātupāsada.) On the day of the 
presentation of this ornament, Migāra held for her a special festival in her 
honour, and she was made to bathe in sixteen pots of perfumed water. This 
account of Visākhā is summarized from DhA.i.384ff.; AA.i.219ff. contains a 
similar account but with far less detail. The DhA. account contains numerous 
other particulars, some of which are given below.</p>
<p>Visākhā had ten sons and ten daughters, each of whom had a 
similar number of children, and so on down to the fourth generation. Before her 
death, at the age of one hundred and twenty, she had eighty four thousand and 
twenty direct lineal descendants, all living. (But see Ud.viii.8, which speaks 
of the death of a grand daughter and of Visākhā’s great grief; this evidently 
refers to Dattā). She herself kept, all her life, the appearance of a girl of 
sixteen. She had the strength of five elephants, and it is said that once she 
took the trunk of an elephant, which was sent to test her, between her two 
fingers and forced him back on his haunches (DhA.i.409). Visākhā owned such a 
great reputation for bringing good fortune that the people of Sāvatthi always 
invited her to their houses on festivals and holidays (Ibid.).</p>
<p>Visākhā fed five hundred monks daily at her house. (Thus, 
e.g., J.iv.144; two thousand, according to DhA.i.128; later she appointed her 
grand daughter, probably Dattā, to officiate for her.) In the afternoon she 
visited the Buddha, and, after listening to his sermon, would go round the 
monastery inquiring into the needs of the monks and nuns (*1). In these rounds 
she was sometimes accompanied by Suppiyā (*2). Visākhā begged for, and was 
granted, eight boons by the Buddha: that as long as she lived she be allowed to 
give robes to the members of the Order for the rainy season; food for monks 
coming into Sāvatthi (*3); food for those going out; food for the sick; food for 
those who wait on the sick; medicine for the sick; a constant supply of rice 
gruel for any needing it; and bathing robes for the nuns (*4).</p>
<p>With the construction of the 
<a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">Mīgāramātupāsāda</a> (q.v.) in 
the <a href="pubbarama.htm" title="pu/pubbarama.htm">Pubbārāma</a> Visākhā’s ambitions were fulfilled, and it is said (DhA.i.416f) 
that when the monastery was completed and the festival of opening in progress, 
as the evening drew on she walked round the monastery accompanied by her 
children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren, and in five stanzas 
sang her joy, saying, “Now is entirely fulfilled the prayer which I prayed in 
times of yore.” (The wishes mentioned in these stanzas 
as having been fulfilled differ from the eight boons mentioned above). The monks 
heard her sing and told the Buddha; he related to them how, in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha, Visākhā had been the friend of the principal women 
benefactors of that Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was Sanghadāsī, 
youngest of the seven daughters of Kiki, and for long after her marriage she 
gave alms and performed other good works with her sisters. (AA.i.219).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*1) Because she wished the Sangha well she was 
  appointed on the committee set up to enquire into the charge of misbehaviour 
  brought against the mother of Kumārakassapa (q.v.); Visākhā’s experience as 
  the mother of several children stood her in good stead.</p>
  <p>(*2) For an incident connected with one of these visits, 
  see Suppiyā. DhA. (i. 100f.) says that once five hundred young men of good 
  family entrusted the care of their wives to Visākhā. On one occasion, when 
  accompanying her to the monastery, they became drunk and committed 
  improprieties in the presence of the Buddha. The Buddha frightened them by 
  emitting a dark blue ray of light, thus restoring them to their senses. This 
  was the occasion of the preaching of the Kumbha Jātaka; see also J.v.11f.</p>
  <p>(*3) Probably on account of this boon the monks who had 
  been to see Khadiravaniya Revata (q.v.) visited Visākhā immediately after 
  their return to Sāvatthi; but see the Pītha Jātaka.</p>
  <p>(*4) This list of boons and Visākhā’s reasons for 
  begging them are given at Vin.i.290ff. According to the Suruci Jātaka (q.v.), 
  she obtained the boons owing to her virtue in the past as well&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  e.g., in her birth as Sumedhā (J.iv.315ff.); see also Vin.i.296, where the 
  Buddha accepts a face towel as a special gift from Visākhā but would not 
  accept an earthenware foot scrubber (Vin.ii.129f.).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>According to the Vihāravimānavatthu (Vv.iv.6; 
VvA.189,191), Visākhā was born, after death, among the Nimmānaratidevā as the 
consort of the deva king Sunimmita.  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.740) that Visākhā, 
like Sakka and Anāthapindika, will enjoy one hundred and thirty one kappas of 
happiness in the Brahma-worlds before she finally passes away into nibbāna.</p>
<p>Among Visākhā’s relations are also mentioned, in addition 
to her two sons Migajāla and Migāra, a sister Sujātā, who became Anāthapindika’s 
daughter in law (A.iv.91; AA.ii.724; J.ii.347); a grandson, Salha (q.v.); a 
granddaughter, Dattā, who died (DhA.iii.278): and Uggaha (q.v.), called 
Mendakanattā. Mention is also made of a grandson of hers on whose behalf she 
interceded with the Buddha when the monks refused to ordain him during the rainy 
season. (Vin.i.153)</p>
<p>The books contain numerous suttas preached by the Buddha 
to Visākhā during her frequent visits to him, chief among such suttas being the 
famous discourse on the keeping of the uposatha, (A.i.205ff.; cf.iv.255; 
DhA.iii.58f) the discourse of the eight qualities which win for women power in 
this world and power and happiness in the next, (A.iv.269) and eight qualities 
which win for a woman birth among the Manāpakāyika devas. (A.iv.267)</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Visākhā</h4>
<p>One of the women who will renounce the world at the same 
time as the future Buddha Metteyya. She will be accompanied by eighty four 
thousand other women. Anāgat. vs. 63.</p>
