  <h2>Puppharatta Jātaka (No. 147)</h2>

<p>Once, during the Kattika Festival in Benares, the wife of 
a poor man insisted on having a pair of garments dyed with safflower to wear at 
the festival. Urged by her desire, the husband stole at night into the king’s 
conservatories to get the safflowers.</p>
<p>He was caught by the guard and impaled alive. He died 
lamenting the non fulfilment of his wife’s desire and was born in hell. The 
Bodhisatta was, at that time, a Spirit of the Air.</p>
<p>The story was told to a passion tossed monk who longed for 
the wife of his lay life. The couple are identified with that of the story. 
J.i.149f.</p>
