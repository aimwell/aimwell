<hr>
<p>1. Kula Sutta.-Families consisting of 
many women and few men are molested by robbers; likewise a monk who has not 
developed emancipation of mind through love is easily molested by non-humans 
(S.ii.263).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kula Sutta. Asibandhakaputta visits 
the Buddha at the Pāvārika-ambavana in Nālandā at 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta’s</a> request, 
and tells the Buddha that he does wrong in obtaining alms from famine-stricken 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>. The Buddha replies that his begging does not come within the eight 
causes of injury to families: viz., </p>
<ul>
  <li>the actions of kings and robbers, fire, 
water, loss of savings, slothfulness, wastrels and impermanence. </li>
</ul>
<p>Asibandhakaputta becomes the Buddha’s follower (S.iv.322f).</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Kula Sutta.-The five advantages which accrue to families visited by holy 
men: </p>
<ul>
  <li>they cleanse their hearts and attain to heaven; </li>
  <li>they greet the monks respectfully and are born noble; </li>
  <li>they conquer greed and gain power; </li>
  <li>give alms and obtain wealth; </li>
  <li>ask questions and become wise (A.iii.244f).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>4. Kula Sutta.-Seven reasons for which a family is not worth visiting: </p>
<ul>
  <li>they neither greet one nor show courtesy; </li>
  <li>provide no seats; </li>
  <li>hide what they have; </li>
  <li>having much, give little; </li>
  <li>what they do give they give carelessly and half-heartedly (A.iv.10).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>5. Kula Sutta.-Similar to 4. Nine 
reasons are given, the additional ones being: they show no desire to hear the 
doctrine and take no interest when it is preached to them. A.iv.387.</p>
