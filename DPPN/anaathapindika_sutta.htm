<hr>
<p>1. Anāthapindika Sutta.-Similar to the 
Anāthapindikovāda Sutta (infra), but the greater part of this discourse is taken 
up with the words of consolation, courage and suggestion addressed by Sāriputta 
to the banker, and we are told that his pains were allayed. No mention is made 
of the advice not to cling to matters mundane, nor of the death of the banker 
almost immediately afterwards. Instead, it is stated that Sāriputta and Ānanda 
were given a meal from the banker’s own cooking-pot and that they went away 
after thanking him. Ānanda reports to the Buddha the news of their visit, and 
the Buddha praises Sāriputta for his wisdom. S.v.380-5.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Anāthapindika Sutta.-The same as the 
above, but Ānanda is given as the admonisher and Anāthapindika is made to claim 
that he had not violated a single one of the obligations binding on a 
householder (gihisāmīcakāni sikkhāpadāni). S.v.385-7.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Anāthapindika Sutta.-Records a visit 
paid by Anāthapindika to the Buddha, who tells him of the five kinds of guilty 
dread (pañca-bhayāni verāni) which are allayed in the Ariyan disciple, and of 
the four limbs of the Stream-winner (sotāpattiyangāni). S.v.387-9.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anāthapindika Vagga.-The second chapter 
of the Devaputta Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikāya contains a series of verses 
spoken before the Buddha on various occasions by devas, the last of them being 
Anāthapindika (reborn in the deva world). S.i.51ff.</p>
