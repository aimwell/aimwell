  <h2>Mahāpurisa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a Great Being, destined to become either 
a <a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakka-vatti</a> or a Buddha. He carries on his person the following thirty two 
marks (<b>Mahāpurisalakkhanāni</b>) (these are given at D.ii.17f.; iii.142ff.; 
M.ii.136f ): </p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>he has feet of level tread; </li>
    <li>on his soles are marks of wheels with spokes, felloes 
    and hubs; </li>

    <li>his digits are long; </li>

    <li>his fingers and toes straight; </li>
    <li>his ankles like rounded shells; </li>
    <li>his legs like an antelope’s; </li>
    <li>standing, he can touch his knees without bending;
    </li>
    <li>his privacies are within a sheath; </li>
    <li>he is of golden hue; </li>
    <li>his skin so smooth that no dust clings to it; 
    </li>
    <li>the down on his body forms single hairs; </li>
    <li>each hair is straight, blue black and at the top 
    curls to the right; </li>
    <li>his frame is straight; </li>
    <li>his body has seven convex surfaces; </li>
    <li>his chest is like a lion’s; </li>
    <li>his back flat between the shoulders; </li>

    <li>they are regular, and continuous; </li>
    <li>lustrous; </li>
    <li>his tongue is long; </li>
    <li>his voice like that of a karavīka bird; </li>
    <li>his eyes intensely black; </li>

<p>The theory of Mahāpurisa is pre Buddhistic. Several 
passages in the Pitakas (E.g., D.i.89, 114, 120; A.i.163; M.ii.136; SN.vs.600, 
1000, etc.) mention brahmins as claiming that this theory of the Mahāpurisa and 
his natal marks belonged to their stock of hereditary knowledge. The Buddhists, 
evidently, merely adopted the brahmin tradition in this matter as in so many 
others. But they went further. In the <a href="lakkhana_s.htm" title="l/lakkhana_s.htm">Lakkhana Sutta</a> (D.iii.142ff) they sought 
to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to 
good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present 
life by means of goodness. Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them 
are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably 
mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being 
adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the 
personification of human sacrifice. Some are characteristic of human beauty, and 
one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities 
possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.</p>
<p>Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own 
theory of the attributes of a Mahāpurisa as explained in the Mahāpurisa Sutta 
(S.v.158) and the Vassakāra Sutta (A.ii.35f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for 
the birth of a Buddha, the Suddhāvāsa Brahmās visit the earth in the guise of 
brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic 
teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha. On his death 
this knowledge generally vanishes. He defines a Mahāpurisa as one who is great 
owing to his panidhi, samādāna, ñāna and karunā. A Mahāpurisa can be happy in 
all conditions of climate. DA.ii.794.</p>
<p><a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a> had three Mahāpurisalakkhanā; he could touch his 
forehead with his tongue, he had a mole between his eyebrows (unnā), and his 
privacies were contained within a sheath. SN.vs.1022.</p>
