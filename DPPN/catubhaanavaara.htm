from the five Nikāyas, chiefly from the Khuddaka Pātha. It also includes several 
suttas and all the well-known Parittas (q.v.). The date of compilation and the 
author are not known. There is a commentary to the book called the 
Sārattha-Samuccaya, written by a pupil of Ānanda Vanaratana Thera, and a 
Sinhalese paraphrase of the eighteenth century, written by Saranankara 
Sangharāja. See Introd. to Sārattha-Samuccaya (H.B.S.); also Gv.65, 75.</p>
