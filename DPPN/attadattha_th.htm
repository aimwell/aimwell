</ul>
<p>When the Buddha announced that he would 
pass away in four months, many puthujjana-monks, out of affection for him, 
stayed near him, not knowing what to do. But Atthadattha, determined to realise 
the aim of his pabbajjā in the Buddha’s lifetime, dwelt apart, in earnest 
striving. His action was reported to the Buddha who, on learning what his 
purpose was, greatly praised him and held him up as an example to the others. At 
the end of the Buddha’s sermon the Thera became an arahant. DhA.iii.158-64.</p>
