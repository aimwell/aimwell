<p>One of the five mountains round Rājagaha 
and one of the beauty-spots of the city (D.ii.116). There was, on one side of 
it, a black stone called the Kālasilā. This was a favourite haunt of the Buddha 
and the members of the Order. See e.g., Viii.ii.76, where Dabba Mallaputta is 
asked by monks to provide for them accommodation there; see also Vin.iii.41.</p>
<p>It was also the scene of the suicide of 
Godhika and Vakkali (S.i.121; iii.121f) and of the murder of Moggallāna by the 
brigands (J.v.125f; DhA.iii.65).</p>
<p>In the Cūla Dukkhakkhanda Sutta it is 
said that a large number of Niganthas lived at Kālasilā, never sitting down, 
undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony, following the teachings of 
Nigantha Nātaputta. The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and 
preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to 
Mahānāma (M.i.91ff).</p>
<p>Once when the Buddha was dwelling at 
Kālasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ānanda a chance, if he so 
desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ānanda did not take his 
opportunity (D.iii.116).</p>
<p>The books refer to several other visits 
of the Buddha to Isigilapassa. During one of these visits he heard Vangīsa’s 
high eulogy of Moggallāna (S.i.194; Thag.1249ff). </p>
<p>In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68-71) the 
Buddha is represented as saying that while the other mountains round Rājagaha — 
Vebhāra, Pandava, Vepulla and Gijjhakūta — had changed their old names, Isigili 
retained its former name and designation.</p>
<p>Five hundred Pacceka Buddhas once 
resided in Isigili for a long time; they could be seen entering the mountain, 
but once entered, there was no more sign of them. Men, observing this, said that 
the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (Isī 
gilatī ti = Isigili).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa adds (MA.ii.889) that when 
the Pacceka Buddhas returned from their begging rounds, the rock would open like 
a folding door to admit them. Within the rock they had made for themselves 
cloisters, dwelling-houses, etc.</p>
