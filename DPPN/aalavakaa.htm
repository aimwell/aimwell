<p>A name given to the monks of <a href="aalavii.htm" title="aa/aalavii.htm">Ālavī</a>. 
 
</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (Sp.iii.561) says that all children born in Ālavī were called Ālavakā. The Ālavakā-bhikkhū are mentioned several times in the Vinaya 
(ii.172ff.; iii.85; iv.34-5) in connection with offences relating to navakamma 
(repairing and reconstruction of buildings), and rules are laid down by the 
Buddha restricting these monks in their activities. Once when one of the monks 
was cutting down a tree which was the abode of a devata, the sprite was sorely 
tempted to kill him, but restraining her wrath she sought the Buddha and 
complained to him. The Buddha praised her forbearance and preached the Uraga 
Sutta (SnA.i.4-5).</p>
<p>In the introductory story of the 
<a href="manikhanta_jat_253.htm" title="ma/manikhanta_jat_253.htm">Manikantha Jātaka</a> (J.ii.282-3) it is stated that the importunities of these 
monks so annoyed the residents of Ālavī that they fled at the approach of any 
yellow-robed monk.</p>
