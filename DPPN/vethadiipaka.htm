<p><b>1. Vethadīpaka.</b> The brahmin of Vethadīpa, who 
claimed an eighth share of the Buddha’s relics. D.ii.165, 167.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vethadīpaka.</b> The king of Vethadīpa and friend of 
the king of Allakappa. They left the world together and became ascetics in the 
Himālaya. Vethadīpaka died and was reborn in the deva world. He then visited his 
friend, and, learning that he had been troubled by elephants, taught him a charm 
to ward off any harm which might come from them. This charm Udena later learnt 
from Allakappa. DhA.i.163f.</p>
