<p><b>1. Gandhāra.</b>-A Pacceka Buddha mentioned

<p><b>2. Gandhāra.</b>-One of the sixteen
<a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a> (countries) (A.i.213; 
iv.252, etc.; in the Niddesa and Mahāvastu lists Gandhāra is omitted and others 
substituted). Its capital was Takkasilā, famous for its university; its king in 
the time of the Buddha was Pukkusāti. There was friendly intercourse between him 
and Bimbisāra of Magadha. Merchants and visitors from one country to another 
were lodged and fed at the expense of the country’s king, and no tariffs were 
levied on their merchandise. There was constant exchange of goods and valuables, 
and on one occasion Bimbisāra, wishing to send his friend a gift of particular 
value, despatched to him a letter containing news of the appearance in the world 
of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. When Pukkusāti read the letter he 
decided to become a follower of the Buddha, and ordained himself as a monk; 
then, leaving his kingdom, he travelled all the way to Sāvatthi to see the 
Buddha (MA.ii.979ff). This conversion of Gandhāra’s' 
king, however, does not seem to have had the effect of converting the rest of 
its people to the Buddha’s faith. The memory of Pukkusāti was evidently soon 
forgotten, for we find Moggaliputta Tissa, at the conclusion of the Third 
Council, sending the Thera Majjhantika to convert Gandhāra (Mhv.xii.3ff).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa’s account, 
Pukkusāti’s kingdom was over one hundred leagues in extent (MA.ii.988), 
and the distance from Takkasilā to Sāvatthi was one hundred and ninety-two 
leagues (MA.ii.987; from Benares it was one hundred 
and twenty leagues, vīsamyo-janasata; J.i.395; ii.47). There was evidently a 
well-known caravan route linking the two countries, although Gandhāra was 
regarded as a paccantima janapada. (MA.ii.982; there was also constant trade 
between Gandhāra and Videha, J.iii.365ff. It would appear from the Mahā Niddesa 
i.154 that Takkasilā was a regular centre of trade).</p>
<p>At the time of Majjhantika’s visit, the 
people of Gandhāra were being harassed by the Nāga-king Aravāla, and the 
chronicles contain details of his conversion by the monk. The Nāga-king, 
together with his retinue, the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, became devout 
followers of the Buddha. Majjhantika preached the Āsīvisūpama Sutta, and many 
thousands joined the Order. (Mhv.xii.9ff; Smp.i.64f; Dpv.viii.4).</p>
<p>Gandhāra appears to have included 
Kasmīra, the two countries being always mentioned together as Kasmīra-Gandhāra. 
They occupied the sites of the modern districts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi in 
the northern Punjab (PHAI. p.93). In the time of Asoka the country formed part 
of his empire, and is mentioned as such in Rock Edict V. Before that it was 
subject to the Achaemenid kings. Gandhāra was always famous for its red woollen 
shawls (kambala) (SNA.ii.487; J.vi.501).</p>
<p>Another king of Takkasilā besides 
Pukkusāti is mentioned — namely, Naggaji, who was a contemporary of Nimi, king 
of Videha. (J.iii.377; cf. Ait. Brāhmana vii.34; Sat. Brāhmana viii.1, 4, 10; 
see also Gandhārarājā).</p>
<p>One of the eye teeth of the Buddha was 
deposited in Gandhāra (Bu.xxviii.6; D.ii.167).</p>
