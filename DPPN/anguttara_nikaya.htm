<p>The fourth division of the Sutta Pitaka, 
consisting of eleven nipātas (sections) and 9,557 suttas (A.v.361; DA.i.23; 
Gv.56). The suttas are arranged in numbered lists, probably as aids to memory. 
Thus we find set out in order first the units, then the pairs, the trios etc., 
up to groups of eleven. This method of arrangement has evidently influenced the 
subject matter as well, for we seldom see any reasoned arguments. The lists are 
often curtly given and curtly explained (See also Hardy’s remarks, A.v. introd. 
p.vii).</p>
<p>At the first Council Anuruddha was asked 
to be the custodian of this Nikāya of 120 bhānavāras and to read it to his 
pupils (DA.i.15; Mbv.94).</p>
<p>When the Buddha’s religion fades away, 
the first portion of the Sutta Pitaka to disappear will be the Anguttara Nikāya 
from the eleventh section to the first, and in that order (MA.881).</p>
<p>It was also sometimes called <b>Ekuttara</b>. 
Mil. 392. It is worthy of note that the Ekottarāgama Sutra of the Chinese is 
unlike the Anguttara Nikaya (A.i. introd. ix., n.4).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikaya quotes the Parāyana, 
which is evidence of its late compilation. (i.133 and 134; ii.45. For other 
quotations in and from the Anguttara Nikaya see A.v., introd. p.ix., nn. 3 and 
4.)</p>
<p>The Commentary to the Anguttara Nikāya 
is called Manorathapūranī.</p>
