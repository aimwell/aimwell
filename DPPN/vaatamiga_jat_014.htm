<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Brahmadatta, king of 
Benares. He had a gardener named Sañjaya. A vātamiga used to visit the royal 
park, and the king asked Sañjaya to catch it. Sañjaya put honey on the grass 
where the animal fed, and, in due course, the animal came to eat out of his 
hand. He was thus able to entice it right into the palace, where he shut the 
door on it. The king marvelled that a vātamiga, who was so shy that if it once 
saw a man it would not visit the same place for a week after, should allow 
itself to be caught by greed.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Cullapindapātika 
Tissa (q.v.), who was enticed back to the lay life by a slave girl. Sañjaya is 
identified with the slave and the vātamiga with the monk. J.i.156ff.</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.199), 
however, it was with reference to Sundarasamudda that the story was told.</p>
