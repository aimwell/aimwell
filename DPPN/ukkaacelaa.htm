<p>A village in the <a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajji</a> country, on the 
banks of the Ganges, on the road from <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> to
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> and near the latter 
(UdA.322).  </p>
<p>Once while <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> was staying there, the Paribbājaka
<a href="samandaka.htm" title="sa/samandaka.htm">Sāmandaka</a> 
visited him and talked to him about Nibbāna (S.iv.261-2). Some time later, after 
the death of Sāriputta and <a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> within a fortnight of each other, the 
Buddha came to Ukkacelā on his way to Vesāli and at a gathering of the monks 
uttered high praise of the two chief disciples and spoke of the loss the Order 
had sustained by their death (S.v.163f).</p>
<p>The <a href="cuula_gopaalaka_s.htm" title="c/cuula_gopaalaka_s.htm">Cūlagopālaka Sutta</a> was also preached 
at Ukkacelā (M.i.225).  </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (MA.i.447) that when the city was being 
built, on the day its site was marked out, fish came ashore at night from the 
river, and men, noticing them, made torches (ukkā) out of rags (celā), dipped 
them in oil, and by their light caught the fish. On account of this incident the 
city was called Ukkācelā (v.l. Ukkacelā, Ukkāvelā).</p>
