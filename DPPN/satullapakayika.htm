<p>A class of Devas. The Samyutta contains (S.i.16 22) a 
whole group of suttas in which these devas are stated to have visited the 
Buddha, asking him several questions on different topics.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.43f ) that, in a previous birth, 
they were a ship’s crew on a trading line. Their vessel was overwhelmed by 
stormy seas, and sank with all on board. During the storm, the terrified crew 
saw one of their number seated like a yogi, calm and self possessed. On being 
asked what he thought of, he said he thought of the good deeds he had done 
before starting on the voyage. These would ensure him happy rebirth, so why 
should he worry? The others then implored his assistance and compassion. He 
divided them into seven groups of one hundred each, and shouted to them, above 
the tempest, the Five Precepts, assuring them that their sīla would bring them 
to a happy dawn. They took the precepts as the waters rose, and were reborn in 
Sakka’s heaven, in different groups, each with his own vimāna. Their teacher had 
a golden vimāna of one hundred leagues in the middle of the others. As soon as 
born they realized the reason for their happiness, and visited the Buddha in 
order to praise their wonderful teacher. They were called Satullapā because they 
shouted the precepts while divided in groups of one hundred (sata ullapā).</p>
