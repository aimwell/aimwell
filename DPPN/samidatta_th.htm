<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and used to 
go to the vihāra to hear the Buddha preach. One day the Buddha preached for his 
special benefit, and, very much moved, he joined the Order. But because of his 
immaturity of knowledge, he continued some time without application. Later he 
was impressed by another sermon of the Buddha, and became devoted and intent, 
attaining arahantship soon afterwards (Thag.vs.90. ThagA.i.189).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Adhichattiya (or 
Chattādhichattiya) of the Apadāna (Ap.i.170). In the past he erected a parasol 
over the cetiya of Atthadassī Buddha.</p>
