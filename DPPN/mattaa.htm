<p><b>1. Mattā. </b>A Therī who came to Ceylon from 
  Jambudīpa and taught the Vinaya at Anurādhapura. Dpv.xviii.12.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mattā. </b>A petī. In her previous life she was married to a 
householder of Sāvatthi, but, because she was barren, her husband married 
another woman, named Tissā, by whom he had a child called Bhūta. One day, when 
Tissā and her husband were talking together, Mattā was seized with jealousy and 
threw a heap of dirt on Tissā’s head. After death, Mattā was born as a petī and 
suffered grievously. She appeared before Tissā, and, at her request, Tissā, gave 
alms to eight monks, giving the merit to Mattā. Mattā immediately won heavenly 
bliss. Pv.ii.3; PvA.82ff.</p>
