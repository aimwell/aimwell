<h4>Pāyāsi</h4>
<p>A chieftain (rājañña) of <a href="setavya.htm" title="s/setavya.htm">Setavyā</a>, who lived on a royal 
domain gifted by <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>. He held the view that there was no world other than 
this, no fruit of actions and no rebirth. But after a discussion with
<a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kūmara 
Kassapa</a>, who was staying in the <a href="simsapavana.htm" title="s/simsapavana.htm">Simsapāvana</a> near by, he was convinced of the 
error of his views. Thereupon he instituted an almsgiving to all who sought his 
generosity. The gifts were, however, coarse and unpalatable. A young brahmin 
named <a href="uttara.htm" title="u/uttara.htm">Uttara</a>, who came to the almsgiving and was passed 
over, spoke scornfully of the gifts. Hearing of this, Pāyāsi appointed him to 
supervise the distribution. After death, Pāyāsi was born among the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> god’s while Uttara was born in 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>. </p>
<p><a href="gavampati.htm" title="g/gavampati.htm">Gavampati</a> met Pāyāsi 
in the deva world, and Pāyāsi instructed him to teach men to give their gifts 
with thoroughness and with their own hands (D.ii.316ff.; VvA.297f., 331f). 
Pāyāsi devaputta was also known as Serīsakadevaputta because he lived in the 
Serīsaka vimāna. For details see <a href="serissaka.htm" title="s/serissaka.htm">Serīsaka devaputta</a>.</p>

<h4>Pāyāsi Vagga</h4>
<p>The sixth chapter of the <a href="vimana_vatthu.htm" title="vy/vimana_vatthu.htm">Vimāna Vatthu</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pāyāsi Sutta</h4>
<p>The twenty third sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya. It contains a 
discussion on rebirth and karma between Pāyāsi and 
<a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kumāra Kassapa</a> in the
<a href="simsapavana.htm" title="s/simsapavana.htm">Simsapāvana</a> at <a href="setavya.htm" title="s/setavya.htm">Setavyā</a> (D.ii.316ff).  </p>
<p>The incidents mentioned in the sutta took 
place, according to <a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> (VvA. p.297), after the Buddha’s death and the 
erection of thūpas over his relics.</p>
