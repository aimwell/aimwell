<h2>Dhītaro Sutta</h2>

</ul>

<p>When Māra retires 
discomfited in his struggle with the Buddha, his daughters, Tanhā, Arati and 
Ragā, undertake to seduce the Buddha. They appear before him in various forms 
and guises, but all their attempts are in vain, and they report their failure to 
Māra. (S.i.124f.  </p>


<p>The sutta is referred to as Kumārīpañha at A.v.46; cp. 
DhA.i.202). See also Palobhana Sutta.</p>
