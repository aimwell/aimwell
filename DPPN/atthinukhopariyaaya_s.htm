<p>Is there a method by following which a 
monk could affirm that he has won insight? “Yes,” answers the Buddha; a monk 
beholding an object or hearing a sound, etc., recognises it with the eye of 
wisdom and of reason, whether it produces in him lust, etc., or not. This method 
leads to insight apart from belief, hearsay, etc. S.i.138.</p>
