<h4>1. Parakkamabāhu I. </h4>
<p>King of Ceylon (1153 86). He was the son of the eldest of 
the three brothers, Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha, who ruled over 
Dakkhinadesa and Rohana. He was born at Punkhagāma in the Dakkhinadesa, where 
Mānābharana was ruler. His birth was accompanied by various miracles. 
Vikkamabāhu II., the then reigning king at Pulatthipura, hearing of this, wished 
to bring the boy up at his own court and make him his heir in place of his own 
son. But Mānābharana refused to consent to this, and soon after died. Thereupon 
his brother Kittisirimegha took over Dakkhinadesa and left Rohana to 
Sirivallabha, who brought Mānābharana’s widow Ratnāvalī with her two daughters 
Mittā and Pabhāvatī and her son Parakkama, to his capital of Mahānāgakula. 
Meanwhile Vikkamabāhu dies and is succeeded by his son Gajabāhu, who maintains 
his position in spite of the attacks of Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha. 
Parakkama, finding no scope for his talents in Rohana, seeks his uncle 
Kittisirimegha, who receives him joyfully and takes him to live in his capital 
at Sankhatthalī. There Parakkama finishes his education, and his coming of age 
is celebrated under the direction of the Senāpati Sankha of Badalatthalī. 
Sirivallabha dies in Rohana and is succeeded by his son, the younger Mānābharana. 
Parakkama’s ambitious spirit makes him restless, and he is discontented at the 
prospect of serving a petty principality. He wishes to seek royal dignity in 
Rājarattha, and refuses to listen to his uncle’s dissuasion, who assures him 
that he is only influenced by his love for him and fears for his safety. But 
Parakkama leaves Sankhatthalī secretly and goes to Badalatthalī, where the 
general Sankha is slain because he informed the king of Parakkama’s flight. 
Parakkama then goes to Buddhagāma 'near the frontiers of the Rājarattha. The 
inhabitants make repeated attempts to check his advance, but he repels these by 
his valour.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Kittisirimegha, after consultation with his 
ministers, sends a stronger force to try and overcome him, but the force is 
ambushed by the prince and completely routed after a night assault in Khīravāpi. 
Parakkama then goes to Rājarattha, where messengers with gifts from Gajabāhu 
meet him, the latter following to greet him in person and bring him to the 
capital. Parakkama lives at the court in Pulatthipura, but spends his time in 
spying out the country and intriguing with his host’s subjects. In order to lull 
the suspicions of Gajabāhu, he gives him his sister Bhaddavatī in marriage, 
keeping her dowry in his own hands. Later, feeling his position insecure, he 
returns to Dakkhinadesa, meeting on the way with all kinds of adventures which 
put his courage to the test. Kittisirimegha, delighted to hear of his return, 
sends messengers to Saraggāma to meet him. But Parakkama hesitates to enter the 
capital until persuaded by his mother to do so. Shortly after, Kittisirimegha 
dies and Parakkama succeeds to the throne. He consolidates his position by 
various captures, including that of Gajabāhu, which follows on the storming of 
Pulatthipura. But Mānābharana comes to the rescue, defeats Parakkama’s army, and 
sets Gajabāhu free; but the latter, finding him unbearable, appeals to Parakkama 
for help. War ensues, and Gajabāhu, again at liberty, flees, while his officers 
fight with Parakkama. Utimately he abdicates in favour of the latter, and dies 
at Gangātata. His ministers, however, send for Mānābharana, while Parakkama 
hastens to Pulatthipura, where he is crowned. A campaign of varying fortunes 
ensues ending in the defeat of Mānābharana, who flees to his own country, where 
he dies. Parakkama is then crowned a second time. Parakkama is now sole monarch, 
but his rule is not universally acceptable. In the fourth year of his reign, 
Sugalā, mother of Mānābharana, raises the standard of revolt in Rohana. The 
campaign against her is a protracted one and is conducted by the general Rakkha. 
In the early part of the campaign the Tooth and Bowl Relies are recovered and 
brought with great ceremony to Pulatthipura. The rebels are gradually cornered 
and defeated. Sugalā is captured, and the revolt collapses. Rohana is quiet for 
a time, but rises again after some years.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of his reign, Parakkama goes to war 
with the king of Rāmañña, disputes having arisen about the elephant trade and 
the treatment of the Sinhalese ambassadors, the crowning offence being the 
seizing of a princess who was being sent from Ceylon to Kamboja. A fleet is 
collected at Pallavavanka, and the soldiers are landed at the port of Kusumī, 
with the Nagaragiri Kitti at their head, a further attack being made by the 
Damilādhikarin Ādicca at Papphālama. After five months the Rāmañña king is slain 
and peace again restored.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Pandu king Parakkama being besieged by the 
Cola king Kulasekhara, appeals for help from Ceylon. Parakkamabāhu sends an army 
under his general Lankāpura, but, in the meantime, the Pandu king has been slain 
and his capital Madhurā taken. The Sinhalese army, however, landed on the 
opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress 
called Parakkamapura. As a result of this campaign, Kulasekhara was defeated and 
the Pandu king’s son, Vīrapandu, was crowned in the ancient capital. The Cola 
prisoners were sent to Ceylon and employed in 
repairing the Ratanavāluka cetiya. The village of Panduvijaya was founded by 
Parakkama to commemorate the victory. The ultimate outcome of this expedition is 
not certain. The Cola records claim that Lankāpura was defeated, and that his 
head was nailed to the gates of Madhurā together with those of his generals. The 
war of the Pandyan succession did not end there.</p>
<p>Parakkamabāhu now engaged in more peaceful pursuits and, 
after some trouble, he succeeded in reconciling the three sects of monks&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri and the Jetavana&nbsp;&nbsp; and held a 
convocation under a thera called Mahā Kassapa. The Vaitulya heresy now finally 
disappeared from Ceylon. The king built for the use of the monks the 
Jetavanārāma, including a round Temple of the Tooth, in the vicinity of the 
royal palace, and, further to the north, he constructed the Ālāhana Parivena, 
the Lankātilaka vihāra and the Baddhasīmāpāsāda. He also built the Pacchimārāma, 
the Uttārārāma and the Mahā Thūpa (or Damila Thūpa).</p>
<p>In the three suburbs he built the Isipatana, the 
Kusinārārāma and the Veluvana vihāras, and, in addition, the Kapila vihāra, 
while he restored the shrines at Anurādhapura.</p>
<p>Parakkamabāhu&nbsp;&nbsp; also enlarged and fortified 
Pulatthipura and adorned the city with numerous palaces and pleasure gardens. He 
paid great attention to irrigation, opening the Ākāsagangā and forming or 
improving a system of irrigation, its centre being in the Parakkama samudda, and 
building numerous tanks throughout the country.</p>
<p>The internal peace of the latter half of his reign was 
disturbed only by a rebellion near Mahātittha, this being easily quelled.</p>
<p>Parakkamabāhu I. was succeeded by his sister’s son, 
Vijayabahu II. According to the Nikāyasangraha, Parakkama was born after death 
as the god Naradeva in the Himālaya.</p>
<p>Chaps. 62 79 of the Cv. are devoted to a description of 
Parakkamabāhu and his reign. The above is a very concise account of the contents 
of these chapters. </p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Parakkamabāhu</h4>
<p>Son of Vijayabāhu III. and brother of Bhuvanekabāhu. He 
was born at Sirivaddhana, and, in his youth, was entrusted to the care of the 
monks under Sangharakkhita. On the death of his father he ascended the throne, 
and reigned for thirty three years (1236 68), at Jambuddoni, as Parakkamabāhu 
II. On account of his profound erudition, he received the sobriquet of Kalikāla 
Sāhicca sabbaññupandita (“the scholar entirely familiar with literature in the 
Dark Age”). The first act of his reign was the bringing of the Tooth Relic from 
the Billa mountain to the capital, amidst the exhibition of various miracles. He 
then set about regaining Pulatthipura from the Tamils, with Māghinda and 
Jayabāhu at their head, and this was accomplished by 1244. In the eleventh year 
of his reign Ceylon was invaded by a Jāvaka (Javanese) named Candabhānu, 
probably a sea robber with a large force. The attack was repulsed by Vīrabāhu, 
the king’s nephew, but Candabhānu appeared again later. The rest of Parakkama’s 
life was devoted to pious works. He invited Cola monks over to Ceylon and held a 
convocation, with the object of reforming the priesthood, and showed special 
honour to Dhammakitti, a monk of Tambarattha. Among buildings erected by him 
were the Bhuvenakabāhu parivena at Billasela and the Mahāmahindabāhu parivena at 
Hatthiselapura. He also restored the vihāras at Kalyāni and at Hatthavangalla. 
He added to the Sirivijayasundaravihāra built by his father and inaugurated a 
yearly festival in Devanagara. He made a pilgrimage to Samantakūta and erected a 
bridge, so that pilgrims might reach it more easily. In all these works he was 
assisted by his minister Devappatirāja. Parakkama had five sons: Vijayabāhu, 
Bhuvanekabāhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabāhu and Jayabāhu. In his old age he 
abdicated in favour of his son Vijayabāhu, who, because of his piety, was called 
Bodhisatta. Cv., chaps. 81 9.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Parakkamabāhu</h4>
<p>One of the five sons of Parakkamabāhu II. Nothing further 
is known of him. Cv.lxxxvii.16.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Parakkamabāhu</h4>
<p>Son of Vijayabāhu IV. and grandson of Parakkamabāhu II. He 
became king about 1302 A.C., but the length of his reign is not known: He paid a 
visit to the Pāndyan king and recovered the Tooth and Bowl Relies which had been 
carried away by Ariyacakkavatti. They were restored to Pulatthipura 
(Cv.xc.48ff). It may be conjectured that Parakkama secured the Relies at the 
price of vassalage to the Pāndyan court.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Parakkamabāhu</h4>
<p>Son of Bhuvanekabāhu II. He became king in Hatthiselapura 
as Parakkamabāhu IV. in about 1325 A.C. The length of his reign is unknown. He 
paid great honour to the Tooth Relic and is said to have written, in Sinhalese, 
a work called the Ceremonial of the Tooth Relic (Dāthādhātucāritta). Cv. xc.64f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Parakkamabāhu V. </h4>
<p>King of Ceylon (Cv.xc.1; see Codrington, op. cit., 83, 89, 
and Cv. Trs. ii. 212, n. 1). He was, perhaps, the brother of Bhuvanekabāhu IV., 
and, probably, had his capital at Gangāsiripura. The period of his reign is not 
definitely known, but it was somewhere between 1348 and 1360 A.C.</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Parakkamabāhu VI. </h4>
<p>King of Ceylon (Cv.xci.16ff.; see also Cv. Trs., ii.215, 
n. 1; and Codrington, op. cit., 90f). He ruled at Jayavaddhanapura. The 
Cūlavamsa tells us nothing of importance except that his mother was Sunettā. We 
gather from other sources that his father was Vijayabāhu, but the authenticity 
of this information is doubtful. The date of his accession is also uncertain. 
Some place it at 1412 A.C., others at 1415 A.C. At the beginning of his reign he 
lived for three years at Rājagāma, moving later to Jayavaddhanapura. Among his 
religious works were the restoration of the monasteries at Gandāladoni and 
Lankātilaka, and the building of a temple of the Tooth in his capital, Also the 
founding of the Sunettā parivena in honour of his mother. He abdicated in favour 
of his sister’s son, Vira Parakkamabāhu, and died after a reign of fifty five 
years. His reign is noted for a great output of Sinhalese literature, 
particularly of poetry.</p>
<hr>
<h4>8. Parakkamabāhu VII. </h4>
<p>Also called Pandita Parakkamabāhu, son of Bhuvanekabāhu 
VI. (Cv.xcii.3). He reigned for four years (circa 1480 84 A.C.), and was slain 
by his uncle who became king as Vīra Parakkamabāhu. Codrington, op. cit., 94f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>9. Parakkamabāhu VIII. </h4>
<p>Also called Vīra Parakkamabāhu, uncle of Parakkamabāhu 
VII. (Cv.xcii.3). He seems to have ruled from about 1484-1509 A.C. He had 
constant trouble with his relations. His successor’s name is uncertain. 
Codrington, op. cit., 94f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>10. Parakkamabāhu IX. </h4>
<p>Also called Dhamma Parakkamabāhu. He is not mentioned in 
the Cūlavamsa, but probably ruled somewhere about 1509 28 A.C. Codrington, op. 
cit., 95f.</p>
