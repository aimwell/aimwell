<p>The Bodhisatta was once a brahmin 
ascetic of great iddhi-power and dwelt in the Himalaya. One day he entered 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and took up his residence in the royal park. The king, pleased with his demeanour, invited him into the palace and asked him to spend the rainy season 
in the park. The king had an ill-natured son, named Dutthakumāra, and despairing 
of ever being able to reform him, handed him over, as a last resort, to the 
ascetic. One day, when the ascetic was walking about in the garden with the 
prince, he asked him to taste the leaf of a young Nimba-plant. The prince did 
so, but at once spat it out, because of its intense bitterness. “If such 
bitterness should reside in the baby-tree, how will it be when it grows up?” 
said the Bodhisatta, and thereupon drew a moral with regard to the prince’s own 
conduct. The prince benefited by the lesson, and thenceforth changed his nature.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
Licchavi-Kumāra called Duttha. J.i.504-8.</p>
