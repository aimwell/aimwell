<p>1. Angirasa (Angīrasa).-A name applied 
to the Buddha several times in the Pitakas. (E.g., Vin.i.25; D.iii.196; S.i.196; 
A.iii.239; Thag.v.536; J.i.116). In the Commentaries three etymologies are 
given: Buddhaghosa says that “it means emitting rays of various hues from the 
body,” and that the word is therefore applicable to all Buddhas alike 
(DA.iii.963). Dhammapāla adds that it signifies being possessed of attainments 
such as virtue, and also that according to some, Angirasa was a personal name 
given by the Buddha’s father in addition to Siddhatha (ThagA.i.503. It is worth 
noting that in AA.i.381 Siddhattha is referred to as Angīrasa Kumāra.) 
</p>
<p>It is, however, well-known that, 
according to Vedic tradition, the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe (see 
Vedic Index: Gotama); the word, as applied to the Buddha, therefore, is probably 
a patronymic, in which case we have another example of a Ksatriya tribe laying 
claim to a brahmin gotra. See Thomas: Life and Legend of the Buddha, p.22-3.</p>

<p>2. Angirasa.-Another name (Angirasa 
gahapati) for Asayha. Pv.p.25, vv.23 and 
<st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="27 ff">27 ff</st1:frenchfranctoeuro>.; 
also PvA.124.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Angirasa.-One of the ten ancient 
seers who conducted great sacrifices and were versed in Vedic lore. The others 
being Atthaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Bhāradvāja, Vāsettha, 
Kassapa and Bhagu. The list occurs in several places, e.g. Vin.i.245; A.iii.224; 
M.ii.169, 200. </p>
<p>The same ten are also mentioned as being 
composers and reciters of the Vedas. D.i.238.</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Angirasa.-A celebrated physician 
(Mil.272). Rhys Davids suggests that the connection of the name Angirasa with 
the physician is due to the charms against disease to be found in the Atharva 
Veda. Mil. trans. ii.109, n. 3.</p>
<hr>
<p>5. Angirasa.-A king, mentioned among the 
descendants of Mahāsammata. Mhv.ii.4; and Dpv.iii.6.</p>
<hr>
<p>6. Angirasa.-An ascetic. The name occurs 
in a list of eleven ascetics who, because of their holy lives, passed the Peta 
world and were born in Brahma’s heaven (J.vi.99; J.v.267). For the others see 
Akitti.</p>
<hr>
<p>7. Angirasa.-An ascetic, Angīrasa 
Gotama, who was killed by the thousand-armed Ajjuna. The ascetic disturbed the 
animals when Ajjuna was waiting to hunt, and the king, in anger, shot at him 
with a poisoned arrow (J.v.135, 144 and 145; DA.i.266). This Angīrasa is 
probably to be identified with one of the foregoing.</p>
