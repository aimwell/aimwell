<p>An arahant. Once, 
when celebrations were being held in honour of the Bodhi-tree of Padumuttara 
Buddha, he poured fragrant water from a painted pot on to the tree. There was a 
thunderstorm and he was killed on the spot by lightning. Being born in heaven, 
he uttered stanzas in praise of the Buddha and his teaching. One hundred and 
twenty-eight kappas ago he became a king, named Samvasita. Ap.i.105f.</p>
