  <h2>Bahuvedanīya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Pañcakanga asks Udāyi (Pandita Udāyī, says MA.ii.629) how 
many kinds of feelings the Buddha mentions. Udāyi answers that there are three:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>pleasant, </li>
  <li>unpleasant and </li>
  <li>indifferent. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pañcakanga, however, insists that there are but two: 
pleasant and unpleasant. Ānanda, overhearing the conversation, reports it to the 
Buddha, who says that both Pañcakanga and Udāyi are correct because he himself 
classified feelings in various ways; sensual pleasures might be pleasant, but 
are not the highest pleasures; far better and more excellent are the pleasures 
enjoyed by a monk who develops the four jhānas, the plane of infinity of 
consciousness and the plane of nought. </p>
<p>M.i.396ff.; the Sutta is repeated at S.iv.223ff., under 
the name of Pañcakanga Sutta.</p>
