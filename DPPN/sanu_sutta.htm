  <h2>Sānu Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Contains the conversation between Sānu’s mother and the 
Yakkhinī, who possessed Sānu (see Sānu) in order to prevent him from “losing his 
soul.” Sānu’s mother says she cannot understand how Yakkhas can possess holy men 
who keep the fasts and lead holy lives. The Yakkhinī says she is right; but 
holiness consists in refraining from evil, both open and secret. Sānu’s mother 
understands, and, when her son regains consciousness and asks her why she weeps 
as he is not dead, she replies that he is as good as dead in that he wishes to 
return to the household life, like goods, which having been rescued from the 
fire, wish to be thrown into it once more. S.i.208f.</p>
