<p>1. Udāyī Sutta.-A conversation between 
Ānanda and Udāyī in the Ghositārāma at Kosambī. Ānanda explains how the Buddha 
has proved that not only the body but even consciousness is without self. 
S.iv.166f.</p>
<p>2. Udāyī Sutta.-Udāyī visits the Buddha 
at Desaka (?) in the Sumbha country and describes how he had realised Nibbāna by 
developing the bojjhangas. S.v.89f.</p>
<p>3. Udāyī Sutta.-Ānanda reports to the 
Buddha that Udāyī preached to a very large following of laymen. The Buddha says 
that this is not an easy thing to do; he who preaches to a large audience must 
see, (1) that his talk has a logical reference, (2) that it has reasoning (pariyāya), 
(3) that it is inspired by kindness (dayā), (4) that it is not for worldly gain, 
(5) that it causes pain to no one. A.iii.184.</p>
<p>4. Udāyī Sutta.-The Buddha asks Udāyī (Lāludāyī 
according to the Commentary) as to what are the topics of recollection. Three 
times he asks the question, but Udāyī sits silent. The Buddha then says he knew 
Udāyī was a fool, and puts the question to Ānanda, who explains five such topics 
connected with the jhānas. A.iii.322-5.</p>
