<p>A brahmin ascetic who went from 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> to <a href="dakkhinaapatha.htm" title="d/dakkhinaapatha.htm">Dakkhināpatha</a> 
and lived on the banks of the <a href="godhaavarii.htm" title="g/godhaavarii.htm">Godhāvarī</a> in a hermitage which lay half in the 
territory of <a href="assaka.htm" title="ay/assaka.htm">Assaka</a> and half in that of 
<a href="alaka.htm" title="am/alaka.htm">Alaka</a>. </p>
<p>He received the revenue of a village near by and held a 
great sacrifice, spending all he possessed. Then to him came a brahmin of 
terrible mien, demanding five hundred pieces. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(He was a brahmin of 
<a href="dunnivittha.htm" title="d/dunnivittha.htm">Dunnivittha</a>. 
His wife was a descendant of the family of <a href="juujaka.htm" title="j/juujaka.htm">Jūjaka</a> and was constantly nagging at 
him. It was she who sent him to Bāvarī, AA.i.183). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Bāvari told him of his 
poverty, the brahmin cursed him saying that his head would split in seven 
pieces. Bāvarī was greatly distressed, but a devatā (his mother in a previous 
birth, AA.i.183), seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin 
knew neither the meaning of “head” nor of “the splitting of it.” “Who then knows 
it?” asked Bāvarī, and the devatā told him of the appearance in the world of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. Forthwith he sent his sixteen pupils —

  <a href="pingiya.htm" title="pu/pingiya.htm">Pingiya</a>&nbsp; 
</li>
</ul>
<p>to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha and to find out 
if his claims to Buddha-hood were justified. The pupils went northward, through </p>
<ul>
  <li> 
<a href="alaka.htm" title="am/alaka.htm">Alaka</a>, <a href="patitthaana.htm" title="pa/patitthaana.htm">Patitthāna</a>, Māhissati, 
  </li>
  <li> 
<a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>, Gonaddha, <a href="vedisa.htm" title="vy/vedisa.htm">Vedisā</a>,  
  </li>
  <li>Vanasavhya (or Tumbava, 
v.l. Vanasāvatthi),  </li>
  <li>Kosambī, Sāketa and Sāvatthi;  </li>
</ul>
<p>then, finding that the Buddha 
had gone to Rājagaha, they followed him there to the 
<a href="pasanaka_cetiya.htm" title="pa/pasanaka_cetiya.htm">Pāsānaka cetiya</a>, passing 
through  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Setavyā, Kapilavatthu,  </li>
  <li>Kusinārā, <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>,

  <li> 
<a href="bhogagamanagara.htm" title="b/bhogagamanagara.htm">Bhoganagara</a> and Vesāli.  </li>
</ul>
<p>When they 
arrived before the Buddha, they greeted him in the name of Bāvarī, and being 
satisfied that he bore the characteristic signs of a Great Being, Ajita asked 
Bāvarī’s question of the Buddha, and when that had been answered, each of the 
pupils asked him a question in turn, to which the Buddha replied. For a problem 
arising out of the manner in which some of the marks were seen, see Mil.168f.; 
DA.i.275f. This account is given in SN.vs.976 1148.</p>
<p>According to the Commentary (SNA.603f), all Bāvarī’s 
disciples and their sixteen thousand followers whom they had gathered on their 
way, became arahants at the conclusion of the Buddha’s sermon, save only Pingiya, 
Bāvarī’s nephew, who became an anāgāmī, because he had been thinking of Bāvarī 
when the Buddha preached. Pingiya took leave of the Buddha and returned to 
Bāvarī, to whom he recounted all these events. At the end of his recital, the 
Buddha appeared before them in a ray of glory and preached to them. Pingiya 
thereupon became an arahant and Bāvarī an anāgāmī.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, 
Bāvarī was King Katthavāhana (q.v.). Hearing of the Buddha from his friend, the 
king of Benares, he sent messengers, including his nephew, to find out about the 
Buddha and to report to him. But the nephew returned with the news of the 
Buddha’s death, which had taken place before their arrival at Benares. 
Thereupon, Katthavāhana, having accepted the Buddha’s teaching, engaged in 
various good deeds and was reborn after death in the Kāmāvacara deva-world. From 
there he was born in the family of Pasenadi’s chaplain and was the teacher of 
Pasenadi’s boyhood. Unwilling to remain longer in the court, he took leave of 
the king and lived in the royal park as an ascetic. Then, wishing for greater 
peace, he retired to an island (antaradīpa) in the Godhāvarī where the two kings 
Assaka and Alaka gave him a tract of land, five leagues in extent, the residence 
of the sages of old. It was from there that he sent his disciples to the Buddha 
(SNA.575ff.; AA.i.182ff). At that time he was one hundred and twenty years old. 
Bāvarī was the name of his gotta. He bore on his body three of the marks of a 
Great Being. SN.vs.1019.</p>
