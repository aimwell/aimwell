<p>Commander-in-chief of the Porisāda, the 
man-eating king, mentioned in the <a href="mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm" title="maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm">Sutasoma Jātaka</a>. When Kālahatthi discovered 
the king’s wickedness, he persuaded him to leave the city, and gave over the 
sovereignty to the king’s son. Some time later, when Sutasoma had cured Porisāda 
of his cannibalistic tendencies, Kālahatthi agreed to restore him to the throne 
(J.v.460-70; 508ff).</p>
<p>Kalahatthi is identified with Sāriputta 
(J.v.511). In several places (E.g., J.v.461, 465, 468) he is addressed as Kāla.</p>
