  <h2>Mangala Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> in answer to a question asked by a 
deva as to which are the auspicious things (mangalāni) in the world. The sutta 
describes thirty seven mangalāni, including such things as the avoidance of 
fools, association with the wise, honouring those worthy of honour, etc. 
(Khp.pp.2f)  </p>
<p>The Commentary (KhpA.vii.; SNA.i.300) explains that at the time the 
sutta was preached there was great discussion over the whole of 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a> 
regarding the constitution of mangala. The devas heard the discussion and argued 
among themselves till the matter spread to the highest Brahma world. Then it was 
that <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> suggested that a devaputta should visit the Buddha and ask him about 
it.</p>
<p>In the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a> (SN., pp. 46f) the sutta is called 
Mahāmangala. It is one of the suttas at the preaching of which countless devas 
were present and countless beings realized the Truth (SNA.i.174; BuA.243; 
AA.i.57,320).</p>
<p>The sutta is often recited, and forms one of the commonest 
of the <a href="paritta.htm" title="pa/paritta.htm">Parittas</a>. To have it written down in a book is considered an act of great 
merit (MA.ii.806).  </p>
<p>It is said (Mhv.xxxii.43) that once
<a href="dutthagaamanii.htm" title="d/dutthagaamanii.htm">Dutthagāmani</a> attempted to 
preach the Mangala Sutta at the <a href="lohapasada.htm" title="l/lohapasada.htm">Lohapāsāda</a>, but he was too nervous to proceed. 
 
</p>
<p>The preaching of the Mangala Sutta was one of the incidents of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> life 
represented in the Relic Chamber of the <a href="mahathupa.htm" title="maha/mahathupa.htm">Mahā Thūpa</a> (Mhv.xxx. 83).  </p>
