  <h2>Abbhantara Jātaka (No. 281)</h2>

<p>The Sister Bimbādevī had suffered from flatulence, and was cured with mango-juice and sugar which Sāriputta had obtained from the king of Kosala, at Rāhula’s request. The king, having heard of Bimbādevī’s affliction, ordered that she should be continually supplied with mango-syrup. On being told of the incident, the Buddha revealed this story of 
the past to show that it was not the first time that Sāriputta had obtained mango-syrup for Bimbādevī.</p>
<p>The atītavatthu is about the chief queen 
of a king of Benares. Sakka, becoming nervous on account of the austerities of 
an ascetic, wishes to destroy him, and arouses in the queen a desire for a 
“Midmost Mango” (Abbhantara-Amba). After prolonged search — during which the 
ascetic and his companions are driven from the royal park because they are 
reported to have eaten the mangoes there — a favourite parrot of the palace is 
commissioned to find the Midmost Mango. He goes to Himavā, and learns from the 
parrots of the seventh mountain range that the mango grows on a tree which 
belongs to Vessavana and which is most strictly guarded. He goes stealthily by 
night to the tree, but is caught by the guardian goblins, who decide to kill 
him. He tells them that he is delighted to die in the performance of his duty, 
and thereby wins their respect. Following their counsel, he seeks the assistance 
of an ascetic, Jotirasa, living in a hut called Kañcanapatti, to whom Vessavana 
sends a daily offering of four mangoes. The ascetic gives the parrot two 
mangoes, one for himself and one for the queen. J.ii.392-400.</p>
<p>Ānanda was the parrot and Sāriputta 
Jotirasa. </p>
