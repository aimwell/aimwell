  <h2>Mahādhammapāla Jātaka (No. 447)</h2>

<p>In Dhammapāla, a village of Kāsi, there lived a family 
whose head was Mahādhammapāla. The Bodhisatta was his son, and was called 
Dhammapala-kumāra. He went to study at Takkasilā. There the teacher’s eldest son 
died, but among all the lamentations it was noticed that Dhammapāla did not 
weep. When questioned by his fellows as to how he could refrain, he answered 
that as it was impossible for anybody young to die, he did not believe his 
friend was dead. The teacher asked him about this, and found that in 
Dhammapāla’s family no one died young. Wishing to know if this were true, he 
left Takkasilā and went to the home of Dhammapāla, carrying with him the bones 
of a goat. After his welcome had subsided, he announced to Dhammapāla that his 
son was dead, and begged him not to grieve. But Dhammapāla clapped his hands and 
laughed, saying that such a thing could never be as no member of their family 
ever died young. He then told the brahmin, in answer to his query, that they 
owed their longevity to the fact that they lived good lives.</p>
<p>The story was related to Suddhodana, who told the Buddha 
how, when the Buddha was practising severe penances, some gods came to him (Suddhodana) 
and said that he was dead. But he refused to believe them. Suddhodana was 
Mahādhammapāla and the teacher Sāriputta (J.iv.50 55). At the conclusion of the 
Jātaka Suddhodana became an anāgāmī and Mahā-Pajāpatī 
Gotamī a sotāpanna. DhA.i.99; J.i.92.</p>
