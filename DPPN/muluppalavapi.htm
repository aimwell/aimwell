<p>A village in Ceylon. A story is told of a monk (according 
to some MSS., his name was Revata) who lived in the vihāra near by (MA.i.536). 
He was an Arahant, and was one day invited to a meal at the house of one of the 
king’s ministers. At the end of the meal the minister’s daughter sat near him 
talking to him. Another monk, seeing them, thought they were on the same seat, 
and when the Elder returned to the vihāra, the monk showed his displeasure in 
various ways. Realizing the reason of the monk’s strange behaviour, the Elder 
convinced him that, as an Arahant, he was incapable of such conduct as was 
attributed to him.</p>
