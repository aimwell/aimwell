  <h2>Gārava Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>As the Buddha sat under the Ajapāla 
Banyan tree, soon after the Enlightenment (in the fifth week, says the 
Commentary, S.A i.158), a thought came to him that he should have someone whom 
he could consider and honour as his teacher. But, seeing no one worthy of such 
honour and respect, he decided that the Dhamma should be his teacher. Thereupon 
Sahampati appeared before him and reminded him that in this decision he was 
acting as all Buddhas acted. S.i.138f.</p>
