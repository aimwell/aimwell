<p>Some ascetics in Himavā failed to take 
their duties seriously and spent their time in eating and making merry. They had 
a monkey who provided them with amusement. One day when the ascetics went to the 
plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin 
ascetic named Komāyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to 
play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him 
to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics. The monkey thereupon became 
virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his 
former friends.</p>
<p>The story was told at the Pubbārāma, in 
reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the 
Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive. At the Buddha’s request, 
Moggallāna made their house shake in order to frighten them. J.ii.447f.</p>
