<p><b>1. Vimaladhammasūriya. </b>King of Ceylon (1592 1604 
A.C.). For his father, etc., see Cv. Trs.ii. 227, n.1. He succeeded Rājasīha I. 
and ruled in Sirivaddhanapura. He built a temple for the Tooth Relic in the 
capital* and, having sent an embassy to Rakkhanga, obtained a chapter of monks 
under Nandicakka to re establish the Order in Ceylon. He built the Ganthamba 
vihāra and held there a ceremony of ordination. He was succeeded by his cousin 
Senaratna, whom he persuaded to leave the Order that he might assume the duties 
of kingship (Cv.xciv.6ff).</p>
<p>* He seems to have made a special casket for the Relics, 
which Kittisirirājasīha later overlaid with gold; Cv.c.21; Cv. Trs.ii.276, n.1.</p>

<p><b>2. Vimaladhammasūriya.</b> King of Ceylon (Vimaladhammasūriya

of the Tooth Relic and the Footprint at Sumanakūta and, sending an embassy to 
Rakkhanga, obtained thirty three monks, headed by Santāna Thera, to reorganize 
the Order in Ceylon. He was succeeded by his son, Narindasīha. Cv.xcvii.1ff.</p>
