<p>A monastery or a village where lived the 
thera Phussadeva, mentioned in the scholiast to the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.490) 
and in the Mūgapakkha Jātaka (J.vi.30; see also Vsm.i.228). Perhaps this 
residence was identical with the Katandhakāra mentioned in the Cūlavamsa 
(Cv.xlv.3). Kassapa II. paid much respect to an Elder of unknown name who lived 
there. It is said that the king had the sacred texts written down with a short 
summary in honour of this Elder. Geiger thinks (Cv. Trs.i.89, n.4) that the 
Padhānaghara called Mahallarāja, which had been erected by Aggabodhi III., 
brother of Kassapa II., in company with the Yuvarāja Māna, was attached to the 
Katandhakāra monastery.</p>
