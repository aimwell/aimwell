<p>The Bodhisatta was once a very clever smith of Kāsi, but 
was very poor. The principal royal smith had a beautiful daughter, and the 
Bodhisatta, wishing to win her, made a delicate needle that could pierce, dice 
and float on water, and for this needle he made seven sheaths. He then went to 
the village of the head smith, stood outside his house, and sang the praises of 
his needle. The smith’s daughter, who was fanning her father, spoke to the 
Bodhisatta and asked him to go elsewhere, as no one in that village would want 
needles. The Bodhisatta answered that his were no ordinary needles, and the head 
smith asked him to show them. The Bodhisatta suggested that all the smiths be 
summoned, and in their presence he gave the needle-tube to the head smith. He 
thought that it was the needle itself, for he could find no end or tip. The tube 
was handed back to the Bodhisatta, who took out the first sheath. In this way 
the seven sheaths were removed, and when the needle was at last revealed he made 
the needle pierce the anvil and lie on the surface of a vessel of water. The 
whole assembly was filled with envy and admiration, and the head smith gave his 
daughter to the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was related in the same circumstances as the 
Mahāummagga Jātaka (q.t). The smith’s daughter is identified with Rāhulamātā. 
J.iii.281-6.</p>
