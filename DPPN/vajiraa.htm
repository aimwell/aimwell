<p><b>1. Vajirā. </b>See Vajirakumārī.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vajirā Therī.</b> The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.134f) 
relates that one day, when she was taking her siesta in Adhavana at Sāvatthi, 
Mārā questioned her as to the origin of “being” (satta), its creator, its 
origin, its destiny. Vajirā answers that there is no such thing as “being,” 
apart from certain conditioned factors, like a chariot, which exists only 
because of its parts. Māra retires discomfited.</p>
<p>Vajirā’s verses are often quoted (E.g Kvu. 240, 626; Mil. 
p.28; Vsm.ii.593) both in the Canon and in later works, but they are not 
included in the Therīgāthā, nor do we know anything else about her.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vajirā.</b> A city in which reigned twenty six 
kings, descendants of Deva. The last of them was called Sādhina (Dpv.iii.20). 
The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.128, 130) calls the city Vajiravutti. According to the 
Buddhavamsa (Bu.xxviii.8), the Buddha’s bowl and staff were deposited, after his 
death, in Vajirā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vajirā.</b> Wife of Sakkasenāpati, the son of 
Kassapa V. She built a parivena, which was named after her. Cv.lii.52, 62.</p>
