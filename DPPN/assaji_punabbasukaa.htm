  <h2>Assaji-Punabbasukā</h2>

<p>The followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. 
They lived in Kītāgiri, between Sāvatthi and Ālavi, and were guilty of various 
evil practices. They used to grow flowers, make wreaths and garlands, and send 
them to girls and women of respectable families and also to slave girls, to lie 
with such women, and disregard the precepts regarding the eating of food at the 
wrong time, using perfumes, visiting shows, singing and playing games of various 
sorts (they violated eighteen precepts, Sp.iii.625). Their abandoned ways of 
life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their 
group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Buddha heard of their nefarious 
doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened 
a meeting of the Sangha, sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna, together with a number 
of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out 
the Pabbājaniyakamma (Act of Banishment) against them. The deputation of the 
Sangha went to Kītāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no 
longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused 
the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kītāgiri, but 
also left the Order. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the 
Pabbājaniyakamma revoked (“because it had served no purpose”) (Vin.ii.9-13, 14, 
15).</p>
<p>In the Dhammapada Commentary (ii.109) we 
are told that Assaji and Punabbasu had originally been disciples of Sāriputta 
and Moggallāna, and that when the two Aggasāvakas admonished them and their 
followers on the wickedness of their conduct, some of them reformed themselves 
and a few retired to the householder’s life.</p>
<p>The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had 
a special dislike for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Once the Buddha, on his way 
somewhere from Sāvatthi, accompanied by Sāriputta, Moggallāna and five hundred 
others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for 
them. They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sāriputta and 
Moggallāna, because “they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such 
desires.” (Vin.ii.171)</p>
<p>But elsewhere (Kītāgiri Sutta, 
M.i.473ff) even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by 
them. When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day 
and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they 
themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside 
prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for 
changing their mode of life. It is true, however, that even on this occasion 
when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his 
admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had 
faith, and we are told that they were “even gladdened in their hearts” after 
hearing the Buddha. There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after 
hearing him.</p>
<p>In the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.525) 
the Assaji-Punabbasukā are mentioned as an example of those who paid no heed to 
precepts great or small, which they had undertaken to observe.</p>
<p>The Samantapāsādikā (iii.614) mentions 
that Kītāgiri was chosen by them as residence because it was watered by both 
monsoons, produced three crops, and had suitable sites for buildings.</p>
<p>They were five hundred in number.</p>
