<p>A locality in Ceylon, perhaps in 
Piyangudīpa. It is known chiefly as having been the residence of the Elder 
Dhammadinna. Mhv.xxxii.52; VbhA.389, 489; Vsm.392, 834.</p>
<p>It may be the place mentioned in the 
Saddhammasangaha (p.88) as the residence of Mahādhammadinna, under the name of 
Talangaratissapabbata (elsewhere (MT.606, n.2) called Vālangatissapabbata). 
There was a cave in it called Devarakkhitalena. </p>
<p>According to the Majjhima Commentary 
(i.149f), Talangaratissapabbata was in Rohana, and between it and Tissamahārāma 
lay the monasteries of Hankana and Cittalapabbata. v.l. Talanka, Tālankara, 
Tālanganagara.</p>
