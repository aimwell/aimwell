<hr>
<p>1. Usabha Thera.-An arahant. He was born 
of a wealthy family in Kosala and entered the Order, when the Buddha accepted 
Jetavana. Finishing his novitiate, he dwelt amidst the mountains. Going out one 
day from his cave after the rains, he saw the loveliness of the woods and 
mountains and reflected, “These trees and creepers, though unconscious, yet by 
the season’s fulfilment, have won full growth. Why should not I, who have 
obtained suitable season, win growth by good qualities?” Pondering thus, he 
strove and obtained insight (Thag.v.110; ThagA.i.217f).</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha, be was a 
devaputta and offered flowers to the Buddha, which remained as a canopy over the 
Buddha’s head for seven days. Ten kappas ago be was a king named Jutindhara. He 
is evidently to be identified with Mandāravapūjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.178.</p>
<p>2. Usabha.-He was born of a Sākyan 
family in Kapilavatthu. When the Buddha visited his family, Usabha saw his power 
and wisdom and entered the Order. But he fulfilled no religious duties, passing 
the day in society and the night in sleep. One night he dreamt that he shaved, 
put on a crimson cloak, and, sitting on a elephant, entered the town for alms. 
There, seeing the people gathered together, he dismounted, full of shame. Filled 
with anguish at the thought of his own muddleheaded ness, he strove after 
insight and became an arahant (Thag.197-8; ThagA.i.319f).</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
householder and gave to the Buddha a kosamba-fruit. He is evidently identical 
with Kosambaphaliya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.449.</p>
<p>3. Usabha.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned 
in the Isigili Sutta. M.iii.70.</p>
<p>4. Usabha.-A setthi of Kālacampā, father 
of Sona Kolvisa (AA.i.131; ThagA.i.544).</p>
