  <h2>Mahājanaka Jātaka (No. 539)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mahājanaka, king of <a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a> in 
<a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a>, had two sons, 
<a href="aritthajanaka.htm" title="ay/aritthajanaka.htm">Aritthajanaka</a> and 
<a href="p4_u.htm#Polajanaka" title="pa/p4_u.htm#Polajanaka">Polajanaka</a>. On his death, the elder came to the throne and 
made his brother viceroy, but, later, suspecting him of treachery, had him put 
in chains. Polajanaka escaped, and, when he had completed his preparations, laid 
siege to the city, killed Aritthajanaka, and seized the throne. Aritthajanaka’s 
wife escaped in disguise, taking with her a lot of treasures. She was pregnant, 
and as her child was the Bodhisatta, Sakka’s throne was heated, and he appeared 
before her as a charioteer and took her to Kālacampā. There she was adopted by 
an Udicca brahmin as his sister and the child was born. When he played with 
other boys they mocked at him, calling him the widow’s son. He asked his mother 
what this meant, but she put him off with evasive answers until one day he bit 
her on the breast and insisted on being told the truth. When he was sixteen, she 
gave him half the treasures, and he embarked on a ship going to 
<a href="suvannabhuumi.htm" title="s/suvannabhuumi.htm">Suvannabhūmi</a> for 
trade. The ship was wrecked in mid ocean, but nothing daunted, Mahājanaka (as 
the boy was called) swam valiantly for seven days, till 
<a href="manimekhalaa.htm" title="ma/manimekhalaa.htm">Manimekkhalā</a>, goddess of 
the sea, admiring his courage, rescued him and placed him in the mango grove in 
Mithilā.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Polajanaka had died and left orders that the 
throne should go to one who could find favour in the eyes of his daughter, 
should know which is the head of a square bed, could string the bow that 
required the strength of one thousand men, and could draw out the sixteen great 
treasures. No one seemed forthcoming who was able to fulfil these conditions; 
the ministers thereupon decked the state chariot with the five insignia of 
royalty and sent it out, accompanied by music. The car left the city gates, and 
the horses went to the mango grove and stopped at the spot where Mahājanaka lay 
asleep. The chaplain, seeing the auspicious marks on his feet, awoke him, and 
explaining to him his mission, crowned him king. When he entered the palace, 
<a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sīvalī</a> (the late king’s daughter) was immediately won over by his appearance, 
and willingly agreed to be his queen. He was told of the other conditions 
mentioned by the dead king; he solved the riddles contained in some and 
fulfilled them all.</p>
<p>In time Sīvalī bore him a son, <a href="diighaavu.htm" title="d/diighaavu.htm">Dīghāvukumāra</a>, whom, in due 
course, Mahājanaka made viceroy. One day Mahājanaka went into his park, and 
noticing how a mango tree, which bore fruit had been plundered by his courtiers 
while another which was barren was left in peace, he realized that possessions 
meant sorrow, and retiring into a room, lived the ascetic life. His life span 
was ten thousand years, of which three thousand still remained to him. After 
living for four months in the palace, he resolved to renounce the world, and 
having made his preparations, secretly left the palace. The queen met him on the 
stairs, but did not recognise him in his ascetic garb. On discovering his 
absence, she ran after him and tried by many devices to persuade him to return, 
but in vain. She then urged his people to follow him, but he turned them back. 
She, however, would not obey him, and for sixty leagues she and the people 
followed Mahājanaka.</p>
<p>The sage Nārada, dwelling in Himavā, saw Mahājanaka with 
his divine eye and encouraged him in his resolve, as did another ascetic, 
Migājina, who had just risen from a trance. Thus they journeyed on till they 
reached the village of Thūnā. There the king saw a dog running away with a 
morsel of roasted flesh, which it dropped in its flight. The king picked it up, 
cleaned it, and ate it. The queen, very disgusted, felt that he was not worthy 
to be a king. Further on they saw a girl shaking sand in a winnowing basket; on 
one arm she wore a single bracelet, on the other arm, two. The two bracelets 
jingled, while the single one was noiseless. Mahājanaka pointed out the moral of 
this to Sīvalī, and she agreed to go a different way, but soon came running back 
to him and followed him till they came across a fletcher, straightening an 
arrow, looking at it&nbsp; with one eye only. On being questioned by the king, 
he answered that the wide horizon of two eyes served but to distract the view. 
But Sīvalī still refused to leave him till, on the edge of a forest, he told her 
there could be no more intercourse between them, and she fell senseless. The 
king rushed into the forest, while the ministers revived the queen. When she 
recovered the king was no more to be seen, and she returned to the city. Thūpas 
were erected on various spots connected with the king’s renunciation, and the 
queen lived as an ascetic in the royal garden of Mithilā.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the Buddha’s 
Renunciation. </p>
