<h2>Kathā-Vatthu</h2>
<p>The fifth of the seven books of the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka. (Sometimes called the third, e.g., in Mbv.94). It seems to 
have been compiled when the contents of at least the Dhammasanganī, the Vibhanga 
and Patthāna were already accepted as orthodox. Tradition ascribes its 
compilation to Moggaliputta-Tissa at the end of the Third Council, held under 
Asoka’s patronage; at Pātaliputta (Mhv.v.278; Dpv.vii.41, 56-8). It was rejected 
by some on the ground that it was set forth two hundred and eighteen years after 
the Buddha’s death, and was hence only a disciple’s utterance; but the 
Commentaries take the view that the mātikā, the principles taught therein, were 
laid down by the Teacher himself, and that the whole work should be regarded as 
the utterance of the Buddha, just as the Madhu-pindika Sutta, preached really by 
Mahā-Kaccāna, is considered as the Buddha’s teaching. The book consists of 
twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions (kathā) and 
refutations of the heretical views of various sects on matters connected with 
theology and philosophy. The Buddha’s authority is accepted as final. See the 
very valuable Preface to the Points of Controversy, by Mrs. Rhys Davids, vii ff 
See also Rhys Davids on “Questions discussed in the Kathā-Vatthu,” J.R.A.S.1892.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been suggested (E.g., 
J.R.A.S.1915, 805ff ) that Asoka’s Rock Edict IX. has been influenced by the 
Kathā-Vatthu. The Therī Khemā, chief of the Buddha’s women disciples, describes 
herself as being “Kathāvatthuvisāradā,” (ThigA.135) thus strengthening the 
theory that the Kathā-Vatthu was known already in the Buddha’s time.</p>
<p>The Udāna Commentary (UdA.94) refers to 
a Kathāvatthupakarana-Tika for details of certain points raised.</p>
