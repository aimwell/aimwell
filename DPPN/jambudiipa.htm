  <h2>Jambudīpa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the four Mahādīpas, or great 
continents, which are included in the Cakkavāla and are ruled by a 
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a>. They are grouped round Mount
<a href="sineru.htm" title="s/sineru.htm">Sineru</a>. In Jambudīpa is <a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himavā</a> with its 
eighty-four thousand peaks, its lakes, mountain ranges, etc. This continent derives its name from the Jambu-tree (also called Naga) 
which grows there, its trunk fifteen yojanas in girth, its outspreading branches 
fifty yojanas in length, its shade one hundred yojanas in extent and its height 
one hundred yojanas (Vin.i.30; SNA.ii.443; Vsm.i.205f; Sp.i.119, etc.). On 
account of this tree, Jambudīpa is also known as Jambusanda (SN.vs.552; 
SNA.i.121). The continent is ten thousand yojanas in extent; of these ten 
thousand, four thousand are covered by the ocean, three thousand by the Himālaya 
mountains, while three thousand are inhabited by men (SNA.ii.437; UdA.300).</p>
<p>Sometimes in Jambudīpa there are as many 
as eighty-four thousand cities; this number is sometimes reduced to sixty 
thousand, forty thousand, or even twenty thousand, but never to less (SNA.i.59; 
J.iv.84 says sixty-three thousand; PvA.111). In the time of 
<a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a> there were 
eighty-four thousand cities, in each of which he built a monastery (Mhv.v.176; 
Vsm.201). In the Anguttara Nikāya (i.35) it is said that, in Jambudīpa, trifling 
in number are the parks, groves, lakes, etc., more numerous the steep, 
precipitous places, unfordable rivers, inaccessible mountains, etc.</p>
<p>At the time of <a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteyya</a> Buddha’s 
appearance on earth Jambudīpa will be pervaded by mankind even as a jungle is by 
reeds and rushes. There will be eighty-four thousand cities with Ketumātī 
(<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>) at the head (D.iii.75).</p>
<p>The Buddha once declared that the people 
of Jambudīpa excel those of both <a href="uttarakuru.htm" title="u/uttarakuru.htm">Uttarakuru</a> and 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> in three respects — 
courage, mindfulness and religious life (A.iv.396; Kvu.99).</p>
<p>Buddhas (and Cakkavattis) are born only 
in Jambudīpa (BuA.48; MA.ii.917).</p>
<p>There were four sounds heard throughout Jambudīpa:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the shout uttered by <a href="punnaka.htm" title="pu/punnaka.htm">Punnaka</a> proclaiming his victory over 
  <a href="dhananjaya.htm" title="d/dhananjaya.htm">Dhanañjaya 
Koravya</a> in a game of dice; </li>
  <li>the bark of <a href="vissakamma.htm" title="vy/vissakamma.htm">Vissakamma</a> when taken about in the guise 
of a dog by Sakka, threatening to devour all wicked beings after the decay of 
Kassapa’s sāsana; </li>
  <li>the roar of <a href="kusa.htm" title="ku/kusa.htm">Kusa</a>, challenging to battle the seven kings who 
sought the hand of Pabhāvatī; </li>
  <li>the yell of <a href="aalavaka.htm" title="aa/aalavaka.htm">Ālavaka</a>, proclaiming his name from 
the top of Kelāsa, on hearing that the Buddha had visited his abode (SA.i.248, 
etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>When opposed to Sīhaladīpa or 
Tambapannidīpa, Jambudīpa indicates the continent of India (E.g., Mhv.v.13; 
xiv.8; Cv.xxxvii.216, 246).</p>
<p>For the purposes of cārikā, the monks 
divided their tours in Jambudīpa into three circuits or mandalas — the 
Mahāmandala which extended over nine hundred leagues, the Majjhima which 
extended over six hundred, and the Antima over three hundred. Those who wish to 
tour the first, start after the mahāpavārana and complete their journey in nine 
months, for the Majjhimamandala they start after the Pavārana, on the full-moon 
day of Kattika, completing the tour in nine months, while for the Antimamandala 
they start on the first day of Phussa and return after seven months (Sp.i.197).</p>
<p>In each Cakkavāla there is a Jambudīpa 
(A.i.227). Mention is made in the <a href="kaakaatii_jat_327.htm" title="ka/kaakaatii_jat_327.htm">Kākāti Jātaka</a> (J.iii.91) of a Jambudīpa-samudda, 
beyond which was the river Kebuka.</p>
