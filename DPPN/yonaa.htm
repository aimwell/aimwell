<p>A country and its people. The name is probably the Pāli 
equivalent for Ionians, the Baktrian Greeks. The Yonas are mentioned with the 
Kambojas in Rock Edicts v. and xii of Asoka, as a subject people, forming a 
frontier district of his empire. The country was converted by the Thera 
Mahārakkhita, who was sent there after the Third Council (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.9; 
Sp.i.67). In the time of Milinda the capital of the Yona country was Sāgala 
(Mil.1). It is said (Mhv.xxix.39) that at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā 
Thūpa, thirty thousand monks, under Yona Mahādhammarakkhita, came from Alasandā 
in the Yona country. Alasandā was evidently the headquarters of the Buddhist 
monks at that time. Alasandā is generally identified (See, e.g., Geiger, Mhv. 
Trs. 194, n.3) with the Alexandria founded by the Macedonian king (Alexander) in 
the country of the Paropanisadae near Kābul.</p>
<p>In the Assalāyana Sutta (M.ii.149), Yona and Kamboja are 
mentioned as places in which there were only two classes of people, masters and 
slaves, and the master could become a slave or vice versa. The Commentary 
(MA.ii.784) explains this by saying that supposing a brahmin goes there and 
dies, his children might consort with slaves, in which case their children would 
be slaves. In later times, the name Yavanā or Yonā seems to have included all 
westerners living in India and especially those of Arabian origin (Cv.Trs.ii.87, 
n.1). Yonaka, statues, holding lamps, were among the decorations used by the 
Sākyans of Kapilavatthu (MA.ii.575). The language of the Yavanas is classed with 
the Milakkhabhāsā (E.g., DA.i.276; VibhA.388). </p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.51) records that from the 
time of Kassapa Buddha the Yonakas went about clad in white robes, because of 
the memory of the religion which was once prevalent there.</p>
