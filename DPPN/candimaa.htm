<p><b>1. Candimā, Candimasa, Canda.</b>-The name 
of the devaputta whose abode (vimāna) is the moon (Canda), sometimes also called 
Candima. The moon is forty-nine leagues in diameter and appears in the world at 
the wish of the Ābhassara Brahmas, who are the first inhabitants of the earth, 
hence its name (amhākam chandam ñatvā viya utthito, tasmā cando hotū ti) 
(VibhA.519; PsA.253). </p>
<p>Candimā is also included among the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> devas because he lives in their world (E.g., Mahāniddesa Cty. 
108). There are other devas besides Canda who dwell in the moon (D.ii.269).
</p>
<p>According to the <a href="bilarikosiya_jat_450.htm" title="b/bilarikosiya_jat_450.htm">Bilārikosiya Jātaka</a> 
(J.iv.63, 69), Sāriputta, having once given alms, was born as Canda, while in 
the <a href="sudhabhojana_jat_535.htm" title="s/sudhabhojana_jat_535.htm">Sudhābhojana Jātaka</a> (J.v.382, 412) it is Moggallāna who was so born. The 
moon cannot move in the sky without the permission of Candimā, and he can stop 
its movement at will (E.g., DhA.ii.143, 146; iii.97). </p>
<p>It is said that once, when Candimā was 
seized by Rāhu Asurinda, he invoked the Buddha in a verse and the Buddha asked 
Rāhu to set him at liberty, which request was granted (S.i.50). The deva 
Candimasa who is mentioned (S.i.51) as visiting the Buddha is probably identical 
with Candimā. The moon was worshipped when children were desired (E.g., J.iv.1).
</p>
<p>The <a href="sasa_jat_316.htm" title="sa/sasa_jat_316.htm">Sasa Jātaka</a> (No.513) gives details 
of the story of how, as a result of the Bodhisatta’s sacrifice when born as a 
hare, Sakka painted the figure of a hare on the moon, which sign will be seen 
throughout this kappa (J.i.172).</p>
