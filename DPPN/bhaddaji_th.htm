  <h2>Bhaddaji Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The son of a setthi in <a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya</a>. He was worth eighty 
crores, and was brought up in luxury like that of the Bodhisatta in his last 
birth. When Bhaddaji was grown up, the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> came to Bhaddiya to seek him out, 
and stayed at the <a href="jaatiyaavana.htm" title="j/jaatiyaavana.htm">Jātiyāvana</a> with a large number of monks. Thither Bhaddaji went 
to hear him preach. He became an arahant, and, with his father’s consent, was 
ordained by the Buddha. Seven weeks later he accompanied the Buddha to 
<a href="kotigaama.htm" title="ku/kotigaama.htm">Kotigāma</a>, 
and, while the Buddha was returning thanks to a pious donor on the way, Bhaddaji 
retired to the bank of the Ganges outside the village, where he stood wrapt in 
jhāna, emerging only when the Buddha came by, not having heeded the preceding 
chief theras. He was blamed for this; but, in order to demonstrate the 
attainments of Bhaddaji, the Buddha invited him to his own ferry boat and bade 
him work a wonder. Bhaddaji thereupon raised from the river bed, fifteen leagues 
into the air, a golden palace twenty leagues high, in which he had lived as 
<a href="mahapanaada.htm" title="maha/mahapanaada.htm">Mahāpanāda</a>. On this occasion the
<a ref="m2_maha.htm#Mahapanada_jat_264"> Mahāpanāda</a> or 
<a href="suruci_jat_489.htm" title="s/suruci_jat_489.htm">Suruci Jātaka</a> was 
preached.  </p>
<p>The <a href="mahavamsa.htm" title="maha/mahavamsa.htm">Mahāvamsa</a> account (xxxi.37ff) says that, before raising Mahāpanada’s palace, Bhaddaji rose into the air to the height of seven palmyra 
trees, holding the <a href="dussa_thuupa.htm" title="d/dussa_thuupa.htm">Dussa Thūpa</a> from the Brahma world in his hand. He then dived 
into the Ganges and returned with the palace. The brahmin
<a href="nanduttara.htm" title="n/nanduttara.htm">Nanduttara</a>, whose 
hospitality the Buddha and his monks had accepted, saw this miracle of Bhaddaji, 
and himself wished for similar power by which he might procure relics in the 
possession of others. He was reborn as the novice <a href="sonuttara.htm" title="s/sonuttara.htm">Sonuttara</a>, who obtained 
the relics for the thūpas of Ceylon.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha, Bhaddaji was a brahmin 
ascetic who, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, offered him honey, 
lotus stalks, etc. Soon after he was struck by lightning and reborn in 
<a href="tusita.htm" title="t/tusita.htm">Tusita</a>. 
In the time of <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a> Buddha he was a very rich setthi and fed sixty eight 
thousand monks, to each of whom he gave three robes. Later, he ministered to 
five hundred Pacceka Buddhas. In a subsequent birth his son was a Pacceka 
Buddha, and he looked after him and built a cetiya over his remains after his 
death. Thag.vs.163f.; ThagA.i.285ff.; also J.ii.331ff., where the details vary 
slightly; J.iv.325; also MT.560f</p>
<p>Bhaddaji is identified with <a href="sumana.htm" title="s/sumana.htm">Sumana</a> of the
<a href="mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm" title="maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm">Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka</a> (J.vi.255).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Bhisadāyaka of the <a href="apadaana.htm" title="ay/apadaana.htm">Apadāna</a> 
(Ap.ii.420f). Bhaddaji is mentioned among those who handed down the 
<a href="abhidhamma_pitaka.htm" title="am/abhidhamma_pitaka.htm">Abhidhamma</a> 
to the Third Council (DhSA.32). </p>
