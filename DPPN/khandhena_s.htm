<p>1. Khandhena Sutta.-All the khandhas are 
impermanent. He who has faith in the doctrine is a saddhānusāri; he who has 
understood it moderately is a dhammānusāri; he who knows and sees the doctrine 
is a sotāpanna. S.iii.227f.</p>
<p>2. Khandhena Sutta.-The arising of 
suffering is due to the arising of the body, etc.; its cessation is brought 
about by their cessation (S.iii.231).</p>
<p>3. Khandhena Sutta.-Desire and lust (chandarāga) 
for body, etc., brings about corruption of the mind. S.iii.234.</p>
