<p>The Bodhisatta once left the 
Brahma-world and was born as the son of the <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> king, but would have nothing 
to do with women. When he grew up his father was filled with despair, and then a 
dancing-girl offered to seduce the prince. She sang outside his door till he was 
filled with desire. Eventually he came to know the joys of love, and filled with 
madness, ran amok through the streets, chasing people. The king banished both 
his son and his seducer, and they lived in a hut away down the Ganges. One day a 
hermit visited the hut and, seeing the woman, lost his power of flying through 
the air. When he saw the Bodhisatta he ran away and fell into the sea. The 
Bodhisatta, realising his plight, told him of the wiles of women and helped him 
to regain his lost power, while he himself sent the woman back to the haunts of 
men and became an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
backsliding brother. J.ii.328ff</p>
