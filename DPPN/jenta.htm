<p>1. Jenta.-A village in Magadha, the 
birthplace of Jenta Thera. ThagA.i.219.</p>
<p>2. Jenta.-A thera. He was born in the 
village of Jenta as the son of a chieftain. He was thoughtful when young, and 
one day, having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and soon became an 
arahant (Thag.vs.111; ThagA.i.219f). He was a devaputta in the time of SikhÄ« 
Buddha and offered him kinkirÄta-flowers. Five kappas ago he was a king named 
Sattuttama. v.l. Sabbuttama. He is probably identical with KakkÄrapupphiya of 
the ApadÄna (Ap.i.177).</p>
<p>3. Jenta Purohitaputta.-A thera. He was 
the son of the chaplain of the Kosala king. (Was he AngulimÄlaâ€™s brother? See 
AngulimÄla). He was intoxicated with pride over his own advantages, and one day, 
though visiting the Buddha, he decided not to speak unless the Buddha should 
address him first. The Buddha, reading his thoughts, preached a sermon, intended 
for him, on the evils of pride, and Jenta became a SotÄpanna. Later he entered 
the Order and became an arahant (Thag.vs.423-8; ThagA.i.455f). Perhaps he is to 
be identified with Manàtthaddha of the Samyutta NikÄya (S.i.177; KS.i.224, n.1).</p>
