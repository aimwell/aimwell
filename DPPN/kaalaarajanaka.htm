<p>King of Mithilā. He was the son of Nimi 
and belonged to the Makhādeva dynasty. Whereas other kings of his race left the 
household at the approach of old age, he broke the tradition by not doing so. He 
was the last king of this dynasty. His son was called Samankara. M.ii.82; 
DA.iii.851; Mhv.ii.11; Dpv.iii.37; but see J.vi.129, where he, too, is said to 
have renounced the world and brought the family to an end.</p>
<p>Kalārajanaka was so called because he 
had long, projecting teeth (MA.ii.738).</p>
