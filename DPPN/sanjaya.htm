<p><b>1. Sañjaya. </b>A gardener (uyyānapāla) of Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares. See the Vātamiga Jātaka. He is identified with the slave girl 
who tried to tempt Cullapindapātika Tissa Thera. J.i.156f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sañjaya. </b>A rājā of Tagara. He renounced the 
world with ninety crores of others and became an ascetic. Dhammadassī Buddha 
preached to them and they all attained arahantship. Bu.xvi.3; BuA.183.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sañjaya. </b>Father of Vessantara. He was the son of 
Sivi, king of Jetuttara, and after his father’s death succeeded him as king. His 
wife was Phusatī. He is identified with Suddhodana of the present age. See the 
Vessantara Jātaka for details. He is mentioned in a list of kings at Dpv.iii.42.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sañjaya Thera.</b> He was the son of a wealthy 
brahmin of Sāvatthi, and, following the example of Brahmāyu, Pokkharasāti, and 
other well known brahmins, found faith in the Buddha and became a sotāpanna. He 
entered the Order and attained arahantship in the Tonsure hall.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he spent all his wealth in 
good deeds and was left poor. Even then he continued to wait on the Buddha and 
his monks and led a good life. Eight kappas ago he was a king named Sucintita. 
(Thag.vs.48; ThagA.i.119f ). He is evidently to be identified with Veyyāvacaka 
Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.138.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sañjaya <a name="Akasagotta">Akāsagotta</a>.</b> In the 
<a href="kannakatthala_s.htm" title="ka/kannakatthala_s.htm">Kannakatthala Sutta</a> Vidūdabha tells the Buddha that it was Sañjaya who started the story 
round the palace to the effect that, according to the Buddha, no recluse or 
brahmin can ever attain to absolute knowledge and insight.  </p>
<p>Sañjaya is sent for 
by Pasenadi, but, on being questioned, says that Vidūdabha was responsible for 
the statement. M.ii.127, 132.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sañjaya. </b>Son of the brahmin Vidhura and younger 
brother of Bhadrakāra. See the Sambhava Jātaka. He is identified with Sāriputta. 
J.v.67.</p>

of Kālāsoka (q.v.).</p>
