<p>A Commentary on the 
<a href="jaataka.htm" title="j/jaataka.htm">Jātaka</a>. It comprises 
all the verses of the <a href="jaataka.htm" title="j/jaataka.htm">Jātaka</a> and gives also, in prose, the stories connected 
with the verses. Each such story is given a framework of introductory episode, 
stating the circumstances in which the story was related, and each story has at 
the end an identification of the chief characters mentioned with the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> and 
his contemporaries in some previous birth.  </p>
<p>The whole collection is prefaced by a 
long introductory essay, the <a href="nidanakatha.htm" title="n/nidanakatha.htm">Nidānakathā</a>, giving the Buddha’s history before his 
birth as <a href="siddhattha.htm" title="s/siddhattha.htm">Siddhattha</a>, and also during his last birth, up to the time of the 
Enlightenment.</p>
<p>The work is a translation into Pāli of 
the commentary in Sinhalese as handed down in Ceylon, but the verses of this 
commentary were already in Pāli.  </p>
<p>The authorship of the translation is 
traditionally attributed to <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a>, but there exists much difference of 
opinion on this point. For a discussion see P.L.C.123ff.</p>
