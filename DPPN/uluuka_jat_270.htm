<p>Once the birds wanted to select a king 
because all the other animals had kings. It was proposed to make the owl king, 
but when the vote came to be taken, a crow stood up and objected, saying: “If 
this is how he looks when he is being consecrated king, how will he look when he 
is angry?” The owl gave him chase and the birds chose a goose instead. Here 
began the eternal enmity of the owl and the crow. The story was told by the 
Buddha when it was reported to him that the owls near Jetavana were killing 
numerous crows nightly. J.ii.351-4.</p>
