  <h2>Pindapātapārisuddha Sutta</h2>

<p>Preached at Veluvana in Rājagaha. Sāriputta visits the 
Buddha and tells him that most of his time is spent aloof. The Buddha praises 
him and says that all monks should practise constant review and self questioning 
when they go begging for alms, and should rid themselves of the evils they have 
and develop those virtues they already possess. M.iii.293 ff.</p>
