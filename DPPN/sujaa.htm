<p>One of the four wives of <a href="magha.htm" title="ma/magha.htm">Magha</a> and his maternal cousin. 
When Magha’s other wives helped him in his good acts, Sujā, claiming kinship 
with him, spent her time in adorning herself. When Magha was born as 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> and 
looked for Sujā, he found that she had been born as a crane in a mountain cave. 
He visited her and carried her to <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> to show her how her companions had 
been born there, as a result of their good acts. He then exhorted her to keep 
the five precepts. This she did, eating only such fish as had died a natural 
death. One day, Sakka, wishing to test her, assumed the form of a fish and 
pretended to be dead. Just as Sujā was about to swallow the fish, it wriggled 
its tail and she let it go. A few days later she died, and was born as the 
daughter of a potter of Benares. Sakka filled a cart with treasures disguised as 
cucumbers and drove it through the city. When people asked him for cucumbers, he 
said, “I give them only to a woman who has kept the five precepts.” Sujā claimed 
them, and Sakka, revealing his identity, gave them to her.</p>
<p>Then she was reborn as the daughter of 
<a href="vepacitti.htm" title="vy/vepacitti.htm">Vepacitti</a>, king of 
the <a href="asura.htm" title="ay/asura.htm">Asuras</a>, a bitter enemy of Sakka. Because of her great beauty, Vepacitti 
granted to Sujā the boon of choosing her own husband, and Sakka, disguised as an 
aged Asura, came to the assembly where she was to choose. Filled with love for 
him, owing to their previous association, she threw the garland round the aged 
Asura, and when the others exclaimed that he was old enough to be her 
grandfather, Sakka took Sujā up into the air and declared his identity. The 
Asuras started in pursuit, but Mātali drove the Vejayantaratha, and Sujā was 
installed in Tāvatimsa as Sakka’s chief consort, at the head of twenty five 
million apsarases. She asked for and was granted as a boon that she should be 
allowed to accompany Sakka wherever he went. DhA.i.269, 271, 274ff.; 
DA.iii.716f.; J.i.201f.; also J.iii.491f., where Sujā accompanies Sakka in his 
travels; at p.494 she is called Sujātā; cf. DA.iii.716.</p>
