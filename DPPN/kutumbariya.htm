<p>A monastery in Rohana. A novice living 
there was in the habit of getting two ladles of rice at the house of a 
Lambakanna in the district. It was a time of scarcity, and one day, seeing a 
guest in the house, he took only one ladleful. The Lambakanna was greatly 
pleased, and when he reported the matter to his friends and acquaintances, they 
gave the novice sixty meals in perpetuity. AA.ii.262.</p>
