<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as Senaka, 
a brahmin, counsellor to King Maddava of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Maddava, seeing that his 
chaplain’s son was yearning for his chief queen, gave her to him for a week. But 
at the end of the week the queen ran away with the youth and the king became ill 
with longing for her. Senaka thereupon arranged for a festival, in the course of 
which the king was shown a man swallowing a sword. The king then asked his 
counsellors, Ayura, Pukkusa and Senaka, if anything could be harder to do than 
that. They, in turn, replied that to promise a gift, to make it, and having made 
it, not to regret it, these acts were, in increasing degrees, far harder than 
swallowing a sword made in Dasanna. The king, grasping the purport of their 
answers, regained his self-composure.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who was tempted by his former wife.</p>
<p>The king was identified with the monk, 
Ayura with Moggallāna, and Pukkusa with Sāriputta (J.iii.336-41).</p>
