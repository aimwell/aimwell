<p><b>1. Gavampati Thera.</b>-An arahant. He was a 
son of a setthi in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, and one of the four lay companions of the Thera 
<a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa</a>, 
who, when they heard of Yasa’s renunciation, imitated him and won arahant-ship. 
Later, Gavampati lived in the <a href="anjana_vana.htm" title="ay/anjana_vana.htm">Añjanavana</a> at Sāketa. One day, when the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> visited the Añjanavana, some of the monks accompanying him slept on the 
sandbanks of the <a href="sarabhu.htm" title="sa/sarabhu.htm">Sarabhū</a>. The river rose in the night and there was great 
dismay. The Buddha sent Gavampati to stem the flood, which he did by his 
iddhi-power. The water stopped afar off, looking like a mountain peak.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="sikhii.htm" title="s/sikhii.htm">Sikhī</a> Buddha he was a 
huntsman and seeing the Buddha offered him flowers. Later he built a parasol and 
a railing for the thūpa of <a href="konaagamana.htm" title="ku/konaagamana.htm">Konāgamana</a>. In the time of 
<a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddha he was a 
rich house holder possessed of many cattle. One day he saw an arahant eating his 
meal in the sun for lack of shade, and built for him a shelter and planted in 
front of it a sirīsa-tree. As a result he was born in the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world, 
and his palace was known as <a href="serissaka.htm" title="s/serissaka.htm">Serissaka</a>. (Vin.i.18f.; Thag.v.38; ThagA.i.103f; 
VvA.331f; DA.iii.814 gives a slightly different version of the origin of the 
Serissaka-vimāna).</p>
<p>Gavampati was the teacher of <a href="mahanaga.htm" title="maha/mahanaga.htm">Mahānāga</a>, 
son of <a href="m1_mag.htm#Madhuvasettha" title="ma/m1_mag.htm#Madhuvasettha">Madhu-Vāsettha</a> (ThagA.i.443). It is said that the Serissaka-vimāna, 
occupied by Gavampati, remained in the Cātummahārajika world even after he had 
left it. (D.ii.356f; DA.iii.814 says he went there because he found the 
“climate” (utu) more agreeable. SNA.i.347 says it was because he, like 
<a href="pindola.htm" title="pu/pindola.htm">Pindola-bhāradvāja</a>, loved his old haunts).</p>
<p>There Gavampati often spent his siesta 
and held conversations with <a href="payasi.htm" title="pa/payasi.htm">Pāyāsi</a>, who sent through him a message to the 
inhabitants of the earth, that they should profit by the example of him (Pāyāsi) 
and discriminate in the bestowal of their gifts.</p>
<p>The Dulvā mentions (Rockhill, p.149f) 
that after the Buddha’s death, when Mahā Kassapa wished to hold a Convocation of 
the chief monks, <a href="punna.htm" title="pu/punna.htm">Punna</a> was sent as a special messenger to summon Gavampati, who 
was then in the Serissaka-vimāna. But Gavampati did not attend, his death being 
imminent. Instead he sent his bowl and three robes as a gift to the Sangha.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards he died, and 
Punna carried out his funeral rites.</p>
<p>Gavampati is evidently identical with 
Girinelapūjaka of the Apadāna (ii.457). </p>

<hr>
<p><b>2. Gavampati.-</b>The Sāsanavamsa (p.36f) 
speaks of a Thera by this name, at whose request the Buddha went to Sudhammapura 
in the Rāmañña country to establish his religion. In a previous life Gavampati 
was born of an egg laid by a Nāga maiden who had relations with a vijjā-dhara. 
The egg was hatched and a child was born, but it died at the age of ten and was 
reborn at Mithilā as Gavampati. He joined the Order at the age of seven and 
became an arahant. Later he visited Sudhamma-pura to preach to his mother, and 
there King Sīha asked him to invite the Buddha to his country.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Gavampati Sutta.</b>-Preached by Gavampati 
at Sahajāti in the Ceti country. A number of the senior monks were talking of 
dukkha, and Gavampati tells them that he knows from the Buddha’s own self that 
whosoever understands dukkha knows all its aspects — its nature, its arising, 
its cessation and the path thereto. S.v.436.</p>
