<p>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are staying at 
the Kalanda-kanivāpa and, in the course of their conversation, it transpires 
that Moggallāna, exercising clairvoyance and clairaudience, had seen and heard 
the Buddha, then dwelling in Jetavana. The subject of his talk was consummate 
energy (āraddhaviriya). Sāriputta declares that, in comparison with Moggallāna, 
he himself is like a mound of gravel set up alongside the Himālaya. Moggallāna 
returns the compliment by saying that, beside Sāriputta, he is like a pinch of 
salt set up alongside a large jar of salt, and recalls the high praise bestowed 
on Sāriputta by the Buddha himself. S.ii.275f.</p>
