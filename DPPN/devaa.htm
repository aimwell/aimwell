<p><b>1. Devā</b>.-A class of beings. As a 
title the word Deva is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as 
being above the human level. Thus it is used for a king. In a late 
classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devil: 
sammutidevā (conventional gods — e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidevā (beings 
who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit — arahants and 
Buddhas); and uppattidevā (beings who are born divine). Under the third category 
various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven: Cātummahārājikā, 
Tāvatimsā, Yāmā, Tusitā, Nimmānaratī, Paranimmitavasavattī and Brahmakāyikā 
(E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.). The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nikāya 
(i.289; iii.100. The Divyāvadāna p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which 
contains the names of twenty-five groups. The popular etymology of the word 
connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing 
oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbantī ti devā, pañcahi kāmagunehi kīlanti, 
attano vā siriyā jotantī ti attho (KhA.123). The word implies possession of 
splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, 
and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction — such 
as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas. The Devas are generally regarded as sharing 
kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devas have been men and may 
again be born among men. They take interest in the doings of men, especially the 
Cātummahārājikā and the gods of Tāvatimsa. They come to earth to worship the 
Buddha and to show reverence to good men. Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as 
chief of the gods — devānam indo. All Devas are themselves in samsāra, needing 
salvation. They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the 
merit of each individual deva. They are born in the full flower of youth and are 
free from illness till the moment of their death. Devas die from one of the 
following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through 
forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to 
anger. (DhA.l.173. For other particulars regarding devas see the article in the 
NPD). When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him: his clothes get 
soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses 
its colour and he becomes restless on his seat. DA.ii.427f; DhSA, 33, etc.
