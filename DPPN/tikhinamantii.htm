<p>Brother of Cūlanī-Brahmadatta. He was 
born while his mother, Talatā, was living with the brahmin Chambhī, after having 
killed Mahācūlanī. On discovering his real parentage, he killed Chambhī, and, 
having taken the throne, sent for his brother, Cūlanī, who was then in exile, 
and crowned him king (J.vi.469, 473). It is said (J.vi.474) that, later, Cūlanī 
was displeased because Tikhinamantī ceased to attend at the palace.</p>
