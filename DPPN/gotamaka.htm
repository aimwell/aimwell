<p>1. Gotamaka.-A class of ascetics, 
enumerated in a list of such classes. (A.iii.276. Does deva-dhammikā in 
Ap.ii.358 (vs.11) qualify Gotamā?) Rhys Davids thinks they were almost certainly 
the followers of some other member of the Sākiyan clan, as distinct from the 
Buddha, and suggests that it might have been Devadatta or possibly a brahmin of 
the Gotamagotta. (Dial.i.222; but see his article on Buddhist Law in ERE.; see 
also Brethren 265, n.3). The Lalita-vistara (p.492), however, speaks of the 
Gautamas in a list of nine such sects; the Gotamakas and the Gautamas are 
evidently identical, as several of the other classes correspond with the Pāli. 
According to the Lalita-vistara, these sects existed even before the Buddha, for 
they are represented as meeting and addressing him in the sixth week after the 
Enlightenment, on his way to the Ajapāla-tree. We hear no more of them in 
subsequent history.</p>
