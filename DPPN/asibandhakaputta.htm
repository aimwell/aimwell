<p>A gāmani (headman). He came to the 
Buddha in the Pārileyyaka Mango Grove in Nālandā and asked him various 
questions, recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.312ff). One of these related to 
the custom among the Pacchābhumaka (Westlander) brahmins (where, perhaps, he 
himself belonged) of lifting a man up when dead and carrying him out, calling 
him by name to speed him heavenward. Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., 
could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose. To this the Buddha 
answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man’s kamma can 
determine where he will be reborn. On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in 
answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain 
disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the 
best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.</p>
<p>Asibandhakaputta tells the Buddha that, 
according to Nigantha Nātaputta (he is described as a Nigantha-Sāvaka, 
S.iv.317), as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny. The Buddha 
points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathāgatas lay down 
definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain 
development.</p>
<p>It is recorded (S.iv.322ff) that once, 
when Nālandā was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigantha Nātaputta, 
who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate. Asibandhaka is at first 
reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and 
he agrees to go.</p>
<p>Is it true that the Buddha extols 
compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place 
stricken with famine? The Buddha’s answer is that there are eight ways of 
injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them. And 
Asibandhakaputta, pleased with the answer, declares himself to be a follower of 
the Buddha.</p>
<p>Asibandhakaputta’s conversation with the 
Buddha, in which the Buddha tells him that only a man’s kamma can determine the 
state of his rebirth, is quoted in the Nettippaka-rana (pp.45-47).</p>
