<p><b>1. Revatī. </b>Wife of Nandiya (q.v.). Her story is given in 
DhA.iii.290ff. and also at VvA.220ff, also referred to in PvA.257. According to 
the VvA. version, Nandiya was born after death in Tāvatimsa, but Revatī, on the 
death of her husband, stopped the gift of alms which he had instituted, abused 
the monks, and was cast alive into hell.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Revatī.</b> An upāsikā, probably of Nālaka. She was a patron of 
Sāriputta, and, on his death, she brought three vases filled with golden flowers 
to be offered at the pyre. Sakka came, with his great retinue, to do honour to 
the Elder, and in the crush caused by his arrival Revatī was trampled to death. 
She was immediately reborn with a body three gāvutas in height in Tāvatimsa, 
and, on discovering the cause of her happiness, she appeared with her followers 
before the people and declared her homage to Sāriputta. SA.iii.177f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Revatī. </b>Another name, according to the Dīpavamsa (xxi.40f.; cp. 
Mhv.xxxv.14f), for Sīvalī, daughter of King Āmandagāmani Abhaya. She was the 
sister of Cūlābhaya and succeeded him for a period of four months, when she was 
dethroned by Ilanāga.</p>
