  <h2>Sambhava Jātaka(No. 515)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Dhanañjaya Koravya, king of Indapatta, asks a question of 
his chaplain Sucīrata on dhammayāga (the Service of Truth). Sucīrata confesses 
ignorance, and declares that none but Vidhura, chaplain of the king of Benares, 
could find the answer. At once the king sends him with an escort and a present 
and a tablet of gold on which the answer may be written. Sucīrata visits other 
sages on the way, and finally Vidhura, who had been his school mate. When the 
question is asked, Vidhura refers it to his son Bhadrakāra, who, however, is 
busy with an intrigue with a woman and cannot give attention to the matter. He 
sends Sucīrata to his younger brother, Sañjaya, but he, too, is occupied, and 
sends him on to his brother Sambhava (the Bodhisatta), a boy of seven. Sucīrata 
finds him playing in the street, but when he is asked the question, he answers 
it with all the fluent mastery of a Buddha. All Benares, including the king, 
hears the answer and stays to listen. Sambhava is paid great honour and receives 
many presents. Sucīrata notes the answer on the golden tablet and brings it to 
Dhañanjaya.</p>
<p>The story is related in reference to the Buddha’s great 
wisdom. Dhanañjaya is identified with Ānanda, Sucīrata with Anuruddha, Vidhura 
with Kassapa, Bhadrakāra with Moggallāna and Sañjaya with Sariputta. J.v.57 67.</p>
