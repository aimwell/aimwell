  <h2>Kukkuravatika Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Haliddavasana to Punna, 
follower of the Bovine Vow (living like an ox), and to Acelaka Seniya, follower 
of the Canine Vow. In answer to their persistent questions, the Buddha says that 
the further state of both is either purgatory or rebirth as an animal (among 
cattle and dogs respectively). He then proceeds to describe the four kinds of 
actions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(1) Dark, with dark outcome; 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(2) bright, with bright outcome;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(3) both dark and bright with similar 
  outcome; and </li>
  <li>
  <p>(4) neither dark nor bright with 
  corresponding outcome. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both Punna and Seniya take refuge in the 
Buddha, Seniya later becoming an arahant (M.i.387ff).</p>
