  <h2>Ajitakesakambala (Ajitakesakambalī)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Head of one of the six heretical sects 
mentioned in the Pitakas as being contemporaneous with the Buddha. He is 
described as a Titthaka (heretical teacher), leader of a large following, 
virtuous and held in esteem by the people (S.i.68).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="samannaphala_s.htm" title="sa/samannaphala_s.htm">Sāmaññaphala Sutta</a> 
(D.i.55), where <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> describes a visit paid to
<a href="ajita.htm" title="am/ajita.htm">Ajita</a>, he taught the 
doctrine of “cutting off,” i.e. annihilation at death. He was a nihilist who 
believed in neither good nor evil. In Tibetan sources he is stated to have 
taught that all beings must dwell in Samsara for 84,000 mahākalpas before they 
come to an end; nothing can prevent that (Rockhill: 103-4). The answer Ajita 
gave to Ajātasattu is given elsewhere (E.g., S.iii.207; M.i.515) as being the 
view of a typical sophist. His name is often introduced into the stereotyped 
list of the six teachers even where the views they are alleged to have expressed 
do not coincide with those attributed to Ajita in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta. E.g., 
S.iv.398, where he is represented as talking about the rebirths of his adherents 
- he who denied rebirth. In A.i.286 he seems to have been confused with 
<a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali 
Gosāla</a>. He was called Kesakambali because he wore a blanket of human hair, which 
is described as being the most miserable garment. It was cold in cold weather, 
hot in the hot, evil-smelling and uncouth (DA.i.144; MA.i.422-3).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="mahabodhi_jat_528.htm" title="maha/mahabodhi_jat_528.htm">Mahābodhi Jātaka</a> the 
Buddha had already refuted Ajita’s view in previous births (J.v.246). Ajita was 
evidently much older in years than the Buddha, for we find 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>, in the 
early years of his friendship with the Buddha, telling him that he was a young 
novice compared with Ajita. S.i.68.</p>
<p>In the <a href="milindapanha.htm" title="me_mu/milindapanha.htm">Milinda-pañha</a> the king says that 
he had visited a teacher named Ajitakesakambala. This cannot possibly refer to 
our Ajita; the reference is probably to a teacher belonging to the same school 
of thought (“There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil karma,” p.4. His 
views are given on p.25 without mention being made of his name. But see note 2 
to the Mil. trans., p.8.). </p>
<p>References to ascetics wearing hair 
garments are found in several passages of the Pali canon. D.i.167; M.i.77, 238; 
A.i.240; for a discussion of Ajita’s views see Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian 
Philosophy, pp.287ff. </p>
