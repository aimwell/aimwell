<p><b>1. Katthavāhana.</b>-A king. A previous 
birth of Bāvarī. Katthavāhana had been a very clever carpenter of Benares, 
having under him sixteen thousand and sixteen assistants. They paid periodical 
visits to the Himalaya forests, felled trees, and having prepared the timber 
which was suitable for building purposes, brought it down the Ganges and erected 
houses for the king and for the people.  </p>
<p>Growing tired of this work, these 
carpenters made flying machines of light wood, and going northwards from Benares 
to Himavā, established by conquest a kingdom, the chief carpenter becoming the 
king. He came to be called Katthavāhana, the capital was named 
Katthavāhananagara and the country Katthavāhanarattha. The king was righteous 
and the people very happy and the country prospered greatly. Later Katthavāhana 
and the king of Benares became sincere friends, and free trade, exempt from all 
taxes, was established between the two countries. The kings sent each other very 
costly and magnificent gifts.  </p>
<p>Once Katthavāhana sent to the king of Benares 
eight priceless rugs in eight caskets of lacquered ivory, each rug being sixteen 
cubits long and eight cubits wide and of unsurpassed splendour. The Benares 
king, wondering how he could adequately return the courtesy, decided to let his 
friend learn the great news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha 
(Kassapa), the Dhamma and the Sangha. This message was written on a gold leaf 
and the leaf enclosed in many caskets, one inside the other, the innermost 
casket being made of the seven kinds of jewels and the outermost of costly wood. 
The caskets were placed on a splendid palanquin and sent on the back of a royal 
elephant, accompanied by all the insignia of royalty. All along the route the 
honours due to a king were paid to the casket, and Katthavāhana himself escorted 
the elephant from the frontiers of his kingdom to the capital. When Katthavāhana 
discovered the message, he was overjoyed, and sent his nephew with sixteen of 
his ministers and sixteen thousand followers to investigate the matter and 
convey his greetings to the Buddha.  </p>
<p>The envoys arrived at Benares only after the 
Buddha’s death, but hearing from the Buddha’s disciples of the Doctrine he had 
proclaimed to the world, the ministers and their followers entered the Order, 
while Katthavāhana’s nephew was sent back to report the news to the king, taking 
with him the Buddha’s water-pot, a branch of the Bodhi tree and a monk versed in 
the Doctrine. The king, having learnt the Doctrine, engaged in various works of 
piety till his death, after which he was born among the Kāmāvacara devas. 
SnA.ii.675ff</p>

<p><b>2. Katthavāhana.</b>-King of Benares. He was 
the Bodhisatta, son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, and of a faggot-gatherer, 
whom the king met in a grove, singing as she picked up the sticks. His story is 
related in the Katthahāri Jātaka. J.i.133ff; DhA.i.349; J.iv.148.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Katthavāhana.</b>-A king. He had been a 
master builder and built for <a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhirājakumāra</a>, a palace called 
<a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanadā</a>, 
unrivalled in its splendour. In order to prevent the building of a similar 
palace for anyone else, the prince decided to make away with the master builder 
at the conclusion of his work, and confided his plan to his friend 
<a href="sanjikaputta.htm" title="sa/sanjikaputta.htm">Sañjikāputta</a>. 
The latter, being most distressed at this suggestion of wanton cruelty, warned 
the builder who, procuring seasoned timber with sap well dried, under pretence 
that it was needed for the palace, shut himself up and fashioned a wooden Garuda-bird, 
large enough to hold himself and his family. When his preparations were 
complete, the builder with his family mounted the bird and rode away through the 
air to the Himalaya, where he founded a kingdom and became known as King 
Katthavāhana (DhA.iii.135f).</p>
<p>The story of the building of the palace 
is mentioned in the introduction to the <a href="dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm" title="d/dhonasaakha_jat_353.htm">Dhonasākha Jātaka</a> (J.iii.157), but there 
we are told that the prince put out the builder’s eyes, and no mention is made 
of the wooden bird and the subsequent story.</p>
