<p>A minister of the king of Benares 
arranged in secret with a band of robbers that when he had collected the revenue 
of a border village he would march his men off to the jungle, leaving the 
robbers free to secure the booty. The plan was carried out, and half the booty 
was made over to him; but his treachery became known and he was disgraced.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
minister of the Kosala king, who was guilty of similar treachery. J.i.354f.</p>
