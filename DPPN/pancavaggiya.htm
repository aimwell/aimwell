</ul>
<p>The name given to the five monks:&nbsp;  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Kondañña, (<a href="annaa_kondanna.htm" title="ay/annaa_kondanna.htm">Aññā 
Kondañña</a>),  </li>
  <li><a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya, </a></li>
  <li><a href="vappa.htm" title="va/vappa.htm">Vappa, </a></li>
  <li><a href="mahanama_th.htm" title="maha/mahanama_th.htm">Mahānāma </a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="assaji.htm" title="ay/assaji.htm">Assaji</a></li>
</ul>
<p>to whom the Buddha 
preached his first sermon at <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>.  </p>
<p>Of these, Kondañña was the youngest of 
the eight brahmins who read the signs on <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama’s</a> body on the day of the name 
giving festival. The four others were children of four of the other brahmins. 
They had been advised by their fathers to watch Gotama’s career and to join him 
should he renounce the world. This they did, and all five joined in the 
austerities of Gotama at  <a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a>. When he abandoned his austerities and started 
to follow the Middle Way, they left him in disappointment. But after the 
Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them and preached to them. At first they 
refused to pay heed to him, but gradually his powers of persuasion won their 
hearts and they became his first disciples.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that, although warned by their fathers of 
the great destiny awaiting Gotama, they were yet reluctant to accept the 
Buddha’s claim to Enlightenment.</p>
<p>J.i.57, 67, 81, 82; DhA.i.87, etc. For details of the 
members of the group, see under their several names; see also article by Mrs. 
Rhys Davids in J.R.A.S. for 1927 on them as the “Unknown co founders of 
Buddhism,” where she suggests that the members of this group were responsible 
for certain tendencies in the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
