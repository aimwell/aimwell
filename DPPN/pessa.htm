<p>An elephant trainer of Campā. </p>
<p>He visited the Buddha at Gaggarāpokkharanī where Kandaraka 
was also present, and his conversation on that occasion is recorded in the 
Kandaraka Sutta. When Pessa had left, the Buddha is reported to have said that 
he was a man of great understanding, and that had he stayed longer he could have 
taken away with him something which would have proved precious to him. M.i.339
