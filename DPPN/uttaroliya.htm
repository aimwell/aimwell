<p>A village in Ceylon, in Rājarattha. Near 
it was Uttaroliyavāpi. The Rasavāhinī has a story of a cowherd boy of the 
village who gave his rice cake to a pindaptāika-thera. The monk developed 
arahantship before eating it. In his next birth the boy was born in the same 
village. By virtue of his merit, a treasure trove appeared in the lake, which no 
one could get except his mother. The king heard of it, and, having tested the 
truth of the story, gave it to the boy. Ras.ii.22f.</p>
