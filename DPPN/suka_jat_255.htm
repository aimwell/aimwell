<p>The Bodhisatta was once a parrot. When he grew old hits 
eyes became weak and he was looked after by his son. The son once discovered a 
special kind of mango on an island, and, having eaten of it himself, brought 
some home to his parents. The Bodhisatta recognized the mango and warned his son 
that parrots visiting that island were short lived. But the son took no heed, 
and one day, while flying back from the island, he fell asleep from weariness 
and was eaten by a fish.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who died of over 
eating. The parrot is identified with him. J.ii.291-4.</p>
