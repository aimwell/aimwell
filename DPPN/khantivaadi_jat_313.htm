<p>The Bodhisatta, under the name of 
Kundaka, was once born in a very rich family of Kāsī. After the death of his 
parents he gave away his immense wealth in charity and became an ascetic in the 
Himālaya. Returning later to Kāsī, he dwelt in the royal park, being tended by 
the commander-in-chief. One day Kalābu, king of Benares, visited the park with 
his harem and, falling into a drunken sleep, left the women to their own 
devices; they, wandering about and meeting the ascetic, asked him to preach to 
them. When the king woke he sought his women, and seeing the ascetic and being 
told that he had been preaching on patience (khanti), he gave orders that the 
ascetic’s own patience be tested. The ascetic was subjected to various forms of 
ill-treatment until, becoming more and more angry at his composure, the king 
gave orders for him to be tortured by the cutting off of his limbs. As the king 
left the park the earth opened and he was swallowed in Avīci. The 
commander-in-chief, hearing what had happened, hurried off to the ascetic to ask 
forgiveness. The ascetic declared that he bore no malice, and died of his 
injuries with a blessing to the king on his lips. It is told by some that he 
went back to the Himālaya.</p>
<p>The story was related at Jetavana in 
reference to a wrathful monk (J.iii.39-43). Kalābu was Devadatta and the 
commander-in-chief, Sāriputta.</p>
<p>The Jātaka is frequently mentioned as an 
example of supreme forgiveness, the ascetic being referred to as Khantivādī 
(E.g., DhA.i.126; KhpA.149; J.i.46; iii.178; vi.257; BuA.51). The Jātaka further 
illustrates how a man’s anger can grow towards an unoffending victim (J.iv.11), 
and how an angry man loses all his prosperity (J.v.113, 119).</p>
