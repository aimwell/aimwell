<p>A robber chief carries on his activities through relying 
on the inaccessible, the impenetrable and the powerful. Inaccessible are 
mountains, etc.; impenetrable are jungles, etc.; powerful are chieftains and 
their ministers, ready to speak in his defence. Similarly, a depraved monk 
depends on crooked actions, wrong views and influential friends. A.i.153.</p>
