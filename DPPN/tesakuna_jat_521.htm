<p>Once upon a time, the king of Benares 
had no heir, but finding three eggs in a nest — an owl’s, amynah’s, and a 
parrot’s — he brought them, and when they were hatched out, adopted the birds as 
his children, giving them the names of Vessantara, Kundalinī and 
<a href="jambuka.htm" title="j/jambuka.htm">Jambuka</a>. When 
they had grown up in the houses of the courtiers who had charge of them, the 
king had them summoned one by one, and asked them for advice as to how a king 
should reign. Each admonished the king in eleven stanzas, and, at the suggestion 
of the admiring populace, they were given respectively the ranks of general, 
treasurer, and commander-in-chief. When the king died, the people wished to make 
Jambuka king, but, having inscribed rules of righteousness on a golden plate, he 
disappeared into the forest.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the admonitions delivered by the Buddha to the king of Kosala. The king of the 
past was Ānanda, Kundalinī was Uppalavanā, Vessantara, Sāriputta and Jambuka the 
Bodhisatta (J.v.109-25).</p>
<p>The verses uttered by Jambuka are often 
quoted. E.g., J.i.177; vi.94.</p>
