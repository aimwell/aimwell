  <h2>Aggika Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Preached by the Buddha to 
<a href="aggika_bharadvaja.htm" title="am/aggika_bharadvaja.htm">Aggika-Bhāradvāja</a> (2). The brahmin exalts the knowledge of the three Vedas. The 
Buddha tells him that a mere babbling of Vedic runes does not make a brahmin of 
a man who is defiled within and is deceitful. He should have knowledge of former 
lives, of other worlds and of the higher lore (abhiññā) that gives cessation of 
birth. </p>
<p>Aggika-Bhāradvāja offers the Buddha the 
prepared meal as a fee for his teaching, but the Buddha rejects it because “the 
Buddhas do not accept wages.” The brahmin should, if he so desire, extend his 
hospitality to him for his holiness, and not for his ability to chant verses. 
S.i.166-7.</p>
