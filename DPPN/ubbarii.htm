<p><b>1. Ubbarī.</b>-A princess. In the time of Kakusandha she was a hen. Having heard a monk repeat a formula of meditation, 
she was born as a royal princess and named Ubbarī. Seeing a heap of maggots in 
the privy, she meditated thereon and entered the first jhāna and was born in the 
Brahma-world. In the time of Gotama Buddha she was reborn as a sow in Rājagaha, 
and the Buddha, seeing her, smiled and related her past to Ānanda. Later she was 
born in the royal household in Suvannabhūmi, then, in succession, in a 
horse-dealer’s house in Suppāraka and in a mariner’s household in Kāvīra. Then 
she was reborn in a nobleman’s house in Anurādhapura, and again in the village 
of Bokkanta in South Ceylon, as the daughter of a householder named Sumana. She 
was called Sumanā, after her father. When her father moved to the village of 
Mahāmuni in Dīghavāpi, Lakuntaka Atimbam, prime minister of Dutthagāmani, met 
her and married her, and she went to live in Mahāpunna.</p>
<p>Having recollected her past births from 
some words uttered by the Elder Anula of Kotipabbata, she joined the Order of 
Pañcabalaka nuns. At Tissamahārāma she heard the Mahā Satipatthāna Sutta and 
became a Sotāpanna. Later, having heard the Āsīvisopama Sutta in 
Kallaka-Mahāvihāra, she attained arahantship. On the day of her death she 
related her story, first to the nuns and then in the assembly, in the presence 
of the Elder Mahā Tissa of Mandalārāma. DhA.iv.46ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ubbarī.</b>-The wife of Cūlanī 
Brahmadatta, king of Kapila in the Pañcāla kingdom. She was a daughter of a poor 
woman in the village, and the king met her while on his wanderings disguised as 
a tailor, which disguise he assumed in order to find out news of the people for 
himself. She was given the name Ubbarī on the day of her marriage, and Cūlanī 
made her his chief queen. When the king died, she went to the cemetery day after 
day, lamenting for her dead husband and refusing to be comforted. One day the 
Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic in Himavā, noticed her with his divine eye and 
appeared before her. Having heard her story, he pointed out to her that 
eighty-six thousand kings of Pañcāla, all bearing the name of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, 
had been burnt in that very spot and that she had been the queen of them all. 
Thereupon, Ubbarī abandoned her grief and renounced the world. She developed 
thoughts of loving-kindness and in due course was reborn in the Brahma-world 
(Pv.32; PvA.160-8).</p>
<p>She is probably to be identified with 
the queen of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, king of Pañcāla, mentioned in the Mahā-Ummagga 
Jātaka (J.vi.473, 475), in which case her original name was Nandā-devī. 
According to the scholiast (J.vi.473), Ubbarī is not a proper name but means any 
women of the court (orodha).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ubbarī.</b>-Queen Consort of Assaka, king 
of Potali in the Kāsi kingdom. She was extremely beautiful and, when she died, 
the king had her body embalmed and placed in a coffin which was put under his 
bed. She, however, was born as a dung-worm because she had been intoxicated by 
her own beauty. The story is related in the Assaka Jātaka. J.ii.155ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Ubbarī.</b>-Wife of the Prince Brahmadatta, mentioned in the Dhonasākha Jātaka (J.iii.161). On his deathbed the 
king thinks of her longingly and speaks of her as being of swarthy hue.</p>
