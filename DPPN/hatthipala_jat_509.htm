  <h2>Hatthipāla Jātaka (No. 509)</h2>
  </li>

<p>Esukārī, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, had no sons. His chaplain, 
hearing that the deity of a certain banyan tree had the power of giving sons, 
went to the tree and threatened to cut it down unless Esukārī had a son. The 
tree deity consulted Sakka, who persuaded four devas to be born as the sons, not 
of Esukārī, but of his chaplain. On the day when the chaplain came to cut down 
the tree, the deity told him of Sakka’s decision, and also warned him that the 
sons would not live the household life. In due course the sons were born and 
were named Hatthipāla, Gopāla, Assapāla and Ajapāla. Various devices were 
adopted to prevent them from turning to the ascetic life. But when Hatthipāla 
grew up he insisted on leaving home and becoming an ascetic, heedless of the 
entreaties both of his father and of Esukārī. His brothers, when their time 
came, acted in the same way. Later, their parents joined them. The king sent for 
all their wealth, but the queen, being wise, made him realize by means of a 
simile the folly of such an act. Together they left the world and joined 
Hatthipāla and his family. The citizens followed their example till the whole 
city was empty.</p>
<p>Hatthipāla preached to them and they all became ascetics. 
His company covered an area of thirty leagues, and with it he went to the 
Himālaya, where Vissakamma, acting under Sakka’s orders, built for them a 
hermitage extending over thirty six leagues, on the bank’s of the Ganges. Soon 
after, other kings who, with their followers, had gone, one after another, to 
take Benares, realizing their folly, joined Hatthipāla and became ascetics.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s Great 
Renunciation. Suddhodana was Esukārī, Mahāmāyā his queen, Kassapa the chaplain, 
Bhaddā Kapilānī his wife, Anuruddha Ajapāla, Moggallāna Gopāla, Sāriputta 
Assapāla and the Buddha himself Hatthipāla.</p>
<p>The large concourse that followed Hatthipāla is called 
Hatthipālasamāgama, and in it were several who later attained arahantship in 
Ceylon — Phussadeva of Katakandharakara, Mahāsangharakkhita of 
Uparimandalakamalaya, Maliyamahādeva, Mahādeva of Bhaggagiri, Mahāsīva of 
Vimantapabbhāra, and Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa (J.iv.473-91; referred to at 
J.i.45). A Burmese monk of Ava, Ratthasāra by name, born in 1468, composed a 
metrical version of the Hatthipāla Jātaka. Bode, op. cit., 44.</p>
