  <h2>Paranimmita Vasavattī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of devas, inhabitants of the highest stage of the 
sensuous universe (kāma-loka).  </p>
<p>They are described (E.g., A.i.210, etc.; S.v.410, 
423; D.ii.91; iii.218) as “beings who desire the creation of others, in order to 
get them into their power.”  </p>
<p>The Commentary (DA.iii.1001; ItvA. 243 f.; see also 
MNidA.109; PSA.441; VibhA.519) explains that the objects of their desires are 
created by other devas who know their weakness, just as a cook, knowing the 
king’s favourite dishes, will prepare them for him. It adds that, according to 
some authorities, their desires are fulfilled by a mere look, a smile, an 
embrace, but this statement is rejected by the ancient Commentary.</p>
