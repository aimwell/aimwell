<p>Eldest son of Upatissa III. He had 
sixteen brothers. When Silākāla rose in revolt, Kassapa defeated him in several 
contests, and in the end pursued him to his stronghold in the Pācīnapabbata, 
riding to the summit of the mountain on his elephant. This deed earned for him 
the title of Girikassapa. Later, while fleeing with his parents from Silākāla, 
he lost his way and was surrounded by his enemies. Finding no way of escape he 
cut his throat. Cv.xli.11ff.</p>
