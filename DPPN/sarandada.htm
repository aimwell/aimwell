<p><b>1. Sārandada Sutta.</b> Once, five hundred Licchavis 
met at the Sārandada cetiya and their discussion turned on the five treasures in 
the world: elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder. Unable to decide on these 
matters, they stationed a man at the road to watch for the approach of the 
Buddha, who was then living in the Mahāvana in <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. On being invited to the Sārandada cetiya, the Buddha went to them, and, having heard of their 
discussion, told them of five treasures much more rare in the world: the 
Tathāgata, his Dhamma, a person able to recognize the Dhamma in the world, one 
who follows it, and one who is grateful. A.iii.167 f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sārandada Sutta.</b> Once, a number of Licchavis 
visited the Buddha at the Sārandada cetiya, and he told them of seven things 
which would ensure their welfare and prevent them from falling: frequent 
assemblies, concord, honouring of tradition and convention, respect for elders, 
courtesy towards women, homage paid to places of worship, and protection of holy 
men in their midst. A.iv.16f.; cf. D.ii.72ff.</p>
<p>This sutta is often referred to in the books, and the 
virtues mentioned are famous as the satta aparihāniyadhammā. The sutta was also 
probably called the Vajji Sutta. See, e.g., DA.ii.524.</p>

<p><b>Sārandada cetiya. </b>A shrine of pre Buddhistic 
worship at <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. It was dedicated to the Yakkha Sārandada, but, later, a 
vihāra was erected on the site for the Buddha and his Order. D.ii.75, 102; 
Ud.vi.1; DA.ii.521; UdA.323; AA.ii.701.</p>
