<p>1. Upacālā.-Sister of Sāriputta (his 
other sisters being Cālā, Sisūpacālā) and mother of Upacāla. When Sāriputta left 
the world to join the Order of monks, his three sisters followed his example and 
became nuns. It is said that when Upacālā was taking her siesta in Andhavana, 
Māra tried to arouse in her sensual desires, but she vanquished him and became 
an arahant. Her conversation with Māra is recorded in the Therīgāthā vv.189-95; 
ThigA.165f. The Samyutta (i.133f) mentions the temptation of all three sisters 
by Māra and their conquest of him. But in this account, Upacālā’s verses are put 
into Cālā’s mouth, Sisūpacālā’s are ascribed to Upacālā and Cālā’s to Sisūpacālā.</p>
<p>2. Upacālā.-The chief of the women 
disciples of Phussa Buddha.</p>
<p>See also Upasālā. (J.i.41; Bu.xix.20).</p>
<p>3. Upacālā.-Chief of the women 
supporters of Sumana Buddha. Bu.v.28.</p>
