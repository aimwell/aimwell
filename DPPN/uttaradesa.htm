<p>A province of Ceylon, probably to the 
north of AnurƒÅdhapura. It was often occupied by the Tamils, and its chiefs 
refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Sinhalese kings. Its people had to be 
subdued from time to time by the Sinhalese kings, in order to establish the 
peace of the land and the security of the throne (See, e.g., Cv.xliv.71; 
xlvii.3, 54; xlviii.83-4, 95, 112).</p>
<p>The district formed a convenient 
landing-place for invaders coming to Ceylon from India, where they might 
complete their preparations (E.g., Cv.i.14). It is sometimes called Uttararattha, 
E.g., Cv.ixx.92.</p>
