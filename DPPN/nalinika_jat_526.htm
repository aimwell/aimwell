<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic in Himavā. A doe drank 
water in which his semen had fallen and conceived a son, whom he adopted and 
Named Isisinga. </p>
<p>Isisinga was a sage of such austerity that Sakka trembled 
at his power. In order to destroy his virtue, Sakka caused a drought in Kasi, 
lasting three years. When the inhabitants complained to the king, Sakka appeared 
before him and suggested that if the king’s daughter, Nalinikā, would seduce 
Isisinga and destroy his virtue, rain would fall. Nalinikā was, accordingly, 
sent to the Himālaya and arrived in Isisinga’s hut dressed in the ascetic’s 
garb, when the Bodhisatta was absent. Pretending to have been wounded by a bear, 
she played on the simplicity of the guileless young man (much as Venus did on 
that of Adonis). Through her seductions his virtue was overcome and leis mystic 
meditation broken off. </p>
<p>Delighted with the outcome of his plot, Sakka caused rain 
to fall on Kasi, and Nalinikā left the hermitage. When the Bodhisatta returned 
and heard of the visit of the youthful ascetic and of all that followed, he 
admonished Isisinga and warned him for the future. The story was told in 
reference to a monk who was seduced by the wife of his worldly days. Isisinga is 
identified with the monk and Nalinikā with his wife. v.l. Nalini Jātaka. 
(J.v.193 209. It is probably a variation of the same story which is found in 
Mtu.iii.143ff).</p>
