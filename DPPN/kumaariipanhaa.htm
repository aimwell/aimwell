  <h2>Kumārīpañhā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Evidently the name given to the 
questions asked of the Buddha by Māra’s daughters, Tanhā, Arati and Ragā — when 
they visited him in order to tempt him — and the Buddha’s answers.</p>
<p>These questions and answers form the 
Dhītaro Sutta of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f), but a quotation from them given 
in the Anguttara (A.v.46f) is mentioned as having been taken from the 
Kumārīpañhā. </p>
<p>The Commentary (AA.ii.828) mentions them 
as being the questions of Māra’s daughters (kumārīnam Māradhītānam pucchā).</p>
