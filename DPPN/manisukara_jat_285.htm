  <h2>Manisūkāra Jātaka (No. 285)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta lived in the Himālaya as an ascetic, and 
near his hut was a crystal cave in which lived thirty boars. A lion used to 
range near the cave in which his shadow was reflected. This so terrified the 
boars that one day, they fetched mud from a neighbouring pool with which they 
rubbed the crystal; but because of the boars' bristles, the more they rubbed, 
the brighter grew the crystal. In despair they consulted the Bodhisatta, who 
told them that a crystal could not be sullied.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an unsuccessful attempt 
by the heretics to accuse the Buddha of having seduced Sundarī (q.v.) and then 
brought about her death. J.ii.415-8.</p>
