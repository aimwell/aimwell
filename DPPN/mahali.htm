<p><b>1. Mahāli</b></p>
<p>A <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavi</a> chief, mentioned as having visited the Buddha 
at the <a href="kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm" title="ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm">Kūtāgārasālā</a> to ask if he had seen 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> (S.i.230; DhA.i.263ff. add that 
the Buddha here related to him the story of <a href="magha.htm" title="ma/magha.htm">Magha</a>) and also to beg information as to 
the teachings of <a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Pūrana Kassapa</a> (S.iii.68). 
This conversation resulted from Mahāli having heard the 
<a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a>. (See
<a href="mahali_s.htm" title="maha/mahali_s.htm">Mahāli Sutta</a>.)  </p>
<p>Mahāli was 
educated at <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>. After his return to Vesāli, he devoted himself to the 
education of the young Licchavi men, but, through overexertion, lost his sight. 
He continued to instruct them, however, and was given a house by the gate, which 
led from Sāvatthi into Vesāli. The revenue from this gate, worth one hundred 
thousand, was given to him (DhA.i.338). When Bandhula came to Vesāli, to satisfy 
the pregnancy longings of his wife Mallikā, Mahāli, hearing the rumble of his 
chariot, instantly recognised it. He warned the Licchavis not to interfere with 
Bandhula, and, finding that they insisted on pursuing him, urged them to turn 
back when they saw Bandhula’s chariot sink up to the nave, or at least when they 
heard a, sound like the crash of a thunderbolt, or when they saw a hole in the 
yokes of the chariot. But they paid no heed to his warnings and were killed 
(DhA.i.350f.; J.iv.148f).</p>
<p>When the Licchavis decided to invite the Buddha to Vesāli, 
to rid the city of its plagues, Mahāli it was who went with the son of the 
purohita to Veluvana to intercede with Bimbisāra, that he might persuade the 
Buddha to come. Mahāli was a favourite of Bimbisāra and a member of his retinue. 
He had attained sotāpatti at the same time as the king (DhA.iii.438).</p>
<p>This Mahāli is perhaps identical with the Mahāli mentioned 
in the Apadāna (Ap.ii.494, vs.28) as the father of <a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sīvalī</a>. His wife was 
<a href="suppavaasaa.htm" title="s/suppavaasaa.htm">Suppavāsā</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahāli. </b>A Sākiyan prince, one of seven grandsons 
of Amitodana. They were brothers of Bhaddakaccānā, wife of Panduvāsadeva, and 
came to Ceylon, where they settled. Dpv.x.6. See Mhv.ix.6, 9.</p>
