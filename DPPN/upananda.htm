<p><b>1. Upananda.-A thera.</b> He belonged to the Sākyan clan. Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. 
Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way 
there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those 
lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the 
matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules 
was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season (Vin.i.153). On 
another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthi, but when the time 
came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given 
to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from 
everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the 
Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending 
the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The 
Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him 
(Vin.i.300). His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a 
meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no 
room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a 
great uproar, but Upananda had his way (Vin.ii.165). Elsewhere he is accused of 
having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthi 
and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the 
monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, 
quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal 
questions.” (Vin.ii.168). Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya 
(Vin.ii.297) a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of 
Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and 
silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p>
<p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared 
for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was 
given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpana should be paid to him in lieu of 
the meat (Vin.iii.236f). Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to 
Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the 
desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, 
Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, 
and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the 
one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his 
robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to 
offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, 
and said he would accept no other (Vin.iii.215). A story is also told of a 
Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was 
of rich colour. Two other Paribbājakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, 
so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused 
(Vin.iii.240f). He did not, however, always come off best</p>
<p>in a bargain. Once he gave a robe to a 
colleague, on condition that the latter should join him in his tours. The 
condition was agreed to, but later, when the recipient monk heard that the 
Buddha was going on tour, he preferred to join the Buddha’s company. The robe 
was not returned to Upananda, who had to be reported to the Buddha for the 
violent language he used to the defaulter (Vin.iii.254f). Upananda is mentioned 
as quarrelling with the Chabbaggiya monks (Vin.iv.30) and, at another time, as 
going his alms-rounds with a colleague with whom he quarrelled when the rounds 
were over, refusing to give him any of the food obtained. The unfortunate monk 
had to starve because it was then too late to go out begging again (Vin.iv.92f). 
We are not told whether Upananda deliberately set out to have a quarrel in order 
that he might keep all the food himself!</p>
<p>Nor were all Upananda’s misdemeanours 
confined to greed for possessions. We are told that once a complaint was made to 
the Buddha that Upananda had gone to the house of an acquaintance and had sat 
down in the bedroom of the woman of the house, talking to her. The husband 
ordered food to be brought to Upananda, and when that was done, asked him to 
leave. But the woman wished him to stay and he refused to go away (Vin.iv.94).
</p>
<p>On two other occasions he is mentioned 
as visiting the houses of his acquaintances and being found by the husbands, 
seated alone with their wives (Vin.iv.95-7; see also 121, 127 and 168, for other 
offences committed by him).</p>
<p>With most laymen, however, be was 
evidently popular. Mention is made of a meal where the donor kept all the other 
monks waiting for quite a long while, till Upananda should arrive, after his 
visits to various households (Vin.iv.98). And, again, of food being sent to the 
monastery with express instructions that the other monks should eat only after 
Upananda had done so (Vin.iv.99).</p>
<p>Episodes regarding Upananda’s misdeeds 
are not confined to the Vinaya. In the Dabbhapuppha Jātaka (J.iii.332ff; see 
also DhA.iii.139ff) we are told that he was in the habit of preaching 
contentment to others. When they, touched by his preaching, cast away their good 
robes, etc., Upananda collected them for himself. Once he cheated two brethren 
of a costly blanket. When the matter was brought to the Buddha’s notice, this 
Jātaka was related to show how in previous births, too, he had plundered other 
people’s goods. He had been a jackal called Māyāvī, and had cheated two other 
jackals of a rohita-fish they had caught. Again, in the Samudda Jātaka 
(J.ii.441f), he is described as a great eater and drinker; he would not be 
satisfied even with cart-loads of provisions. The Jātaka tells of how he once 
was born as a water-crow and tried to prevent the fish from drinking the 
sea-water lest he should not have enough for himself. Buddhaghosa calls him a 
lolajātika, held in contempt by his eighty thousand fellow Sākyans who joined 
the Order (Sp.iii.665). Elsewhere he is referred to as a well-known example of 
one who never practised what he preached and, therefore, did not benefit by his 
cleverness. E.g., AA.i.92; MA.i.348; Vsm.i.81.</p>
<p>Upananda had under him two novices, 
Kandaka and Mahaka, who seem to have resembled their teacher in being 
undesirables. They were found guilty of an unnatural offence, and the Buddha 
ordered that no one should ordain them (Vin.i.79). This order seems to have been 
rescinded later (see Vin.i.83).</p>
