<p>1. P훮panika Sutta. The shopkeeper who neglects his duties 
at early dawn, at midday, and at eventide, does not prosper; nor does the monk 
who similarly neglects his duties. A.i.115.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. P훮panika Sutta. The shopkeeper who is shrewd, supremely 
capable, and who inspires confidence, soon attains to greatness and increase of 
wealth; a monk will in like manner attain to spiritual development. A.i.115f.</p>
