<p><b>1. Sañjiva. </b>One of the two chief disciples of 
Kakusandha Buddha (D.ii.4; J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.20). He was expert in samādhi, and 
lived in cells, caves, etc., sustaining himself on samādhi. One day, when in a 
state of trance in a forest, woodmen, thinking him dead, burnt his body, but he, 
emerging at the proper time from his trance, shook out his robes and entered the 
village for alms; hence his name, Sañjīva (Quick) (M.i.333; cf. DA.ii.417; 
MA.i.522; PSA.496). This feat is referred to as an example of samādhi-vipphāra 
iddhi. E.g., Vsm.380, 706; PS.ii.212; BuA.24, etc.</p>

<p><b>2. Sañjīva. </b>A Niraya. Beings born there are 
subjected to numerous tortures, but contrive to survive them; hence the name. 
J.v.266, 270.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sañjīva.</b> A brahmin who could bring the dead to 
life; see the Sañjīva Jātaka. He is identified with Ajātasattu. J.i.511.</p>
