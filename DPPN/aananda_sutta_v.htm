<hr>
<p><b>1. Ānanda Sutta</b>.-Preached by Ānanda to 
Vangīsa. Once as they were going together for alms to Sāvatthi, Vangīsa 
confessed that he was disaffected. Ānanda advised him on how to overcome the 
disaffection by proper cultivation of the senses. S.i.188.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Once Ānanda was living 
in a forest tract in the Kosala country and was much occupied in talking to the 
laity who came to see him. A deva of the forest, desiring his welfare, came up 
to him and suggested that he might stop his constant babbling and meditate 
instead (S.i.199). According to Buddhaghosa (SA.i.225), this was soon after the 
Buddha’s death, shortly before Ānanda became arahant. People, knowing of his 
close attendance on the Master, were ever asking for details about the 
Parinibbāna and when they mourned he had to admonish them. He used to wander 
about, taking with him the Buddha’s begging bowl and robe. In the Theragāthā 
(ver.119; ThagA.i.237) the same admonition is put into the mouth of a Vajjiputta 
monk.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Preached by the Buddha 
to Ānanda, who asked how nirodha could be obtained. By the cessation of the five 
khandhas, answered the Buddha. S.iii.24-5.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-A conversation between 
the Buddha and Ānanda, at Jetavana. Ānanda is asked in what things one discerns 
the arising (uppāda), passing away (vaya), and constant change (aññathatta). The 
answer is “in the five khandhas.” The Buddha praises Ānanda for his answer. 
S.iii.37-8.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Same as above, except 
that the discernment is not only with regard to the present, but also to the 
past and the future. S.iii.38-9.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Ānanda tells the monks 
in Jetavana how when he and his colleagues were novices, Punna Mantāniputta was 
very helpful to them and instructed them as to how the conceit of self (asmimāna) 
arose and how it could be overcome. Having heard him, Ānanda says he fully 
understood the Dhamma. S.iii.105-6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Preached at Jetavana. Ānanda asks the Buddha about psychic power (iddhi), its basis and cultivation, 
and the practice thereof. The Buddha enlightens him. S.v.285-6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Same as above, with the 
addition of Ānanda’s declaration that the monks consider the Buddha as their 
guide, etc. S.v.286.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Preached at Jetavana. Ānanda is instructed as to how concentration on breathing (ānāpānasati) leads to 
the four satipatthānas and how these, in turn, bring to completion the seven 
bojjhangas. These last lead to complete knowledge and release (vijjāvimutti). 
The methods of their development are explained in detail. S.v.328-33.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Same as above, the 
only difference being the same as between 7 and 8.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Records a visit paid 
to Ānanda at Jetavana by Sāriputta, who was also staying there. Sāriputta tells 
Ānanda that sotāpannas are those that have no disloyalty to the Buddha, the 
Dhamma and the Sangha. They have no such immorality as is possessed by the 
uneducated putthujjanas. S.v.362-4.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Preached at the Ghositārāma in Kosambi. Ānanda asks the Buddha how monks could enjoy ease (phāsuvihāra) 
and the Buddha tells him (A.iii.132-4).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-A conversation between Ānanda and Mahā Kotthita with regard to what happens after the passionless, 
remainder less ending of the six spheres of contact. A.ii.162. The P.T.S. text 
puts this under Kotthita Sutta, but both the Commentary and the Uddāna at the 
end of the Vagga treat it as a separate sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>14. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-Ānanda goes to 
Sāriputta and asks him how far a monk could learn the Dhamma, remember it, 
reflect upon it and teach it to others. Sāriputta suggests that Ānanda should 
answer the question himself, which Ānanda does. At the end of the discourse 
Sāriputta utters an eulogy on Ānanda and calls him the pattern of the true monk. 
A.iii.361-2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>15. Ānanda Sutta</b>.-Preached by the Buddha 
in reply to Ānanda’s question as to how notions of “I” and “mine” and the 
tendency to vain conceit could be completely destroyed (A.i.132f). This sutta 
refers to the Punnaka-pañha of the Parāyana.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>16. Ānanda Sutta.</b>-A conversation between Ānanda and Udāyī on the wonders of a Tathāgata’s attainment and the nature of 
perception. In the course of the dialogue Ānanda mentions a visit paid to him by 
a nun who was a follower of the Jatilas, and her questions on samādhi. A.iv.426.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>17. Ānanda Sutta</b>.-A discourse given to 
the monks by Ānanda on the good man and the wicked man. A.v.6f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>18. Ānanda Sutta</b>.-On the ten qualities 
that a monk should possess if he would benefit by the practice of the Buddha’s 
teachings. A.v.152ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Ānanda or Atthatta Sutta.</b>-The 
Paribbājaka Vacchagotta visits the Buddha and asks him if there is a self. The 
Buddha makes no reply even when the question is repeated, and Vacchagotta goes 
away. The Buddha, later, explains to Ānanda, in reply to his inquiry, that he 
remained silent because whatever answer he gave to Vacchagotta’s question, it 
would be capable of being misunderstood and misinterpreted. S.iv.400-1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Ānanda Vagga.</b>-The eighth chapter of the 
Tīkā Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya. It consists of ten suttas, the last of 
which contains a prophecy regarding Ānanda. A.i.215-28.</p>
