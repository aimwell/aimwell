  <h2>Potthapāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A discussion between the Buddha and the Paribbājaka 
Potthapāda, held at the Mallikārāma (D.i.178 203). It deals with the question of 
trances and of the soul, and also with the infinity and eternalism of the world.
</p>
<p>This sutta is significant as containing a list of the 
topics which Paribbājakas appear to have discussed at their meetings.</p>
