<p>Brahmadatta, king of Benares, could not 
look upon anyone old or decrepit without playing jokes on them. He made old men 
roll about on the ground and played practical jokes on old women. His friends 
behaved likewise. All old people left his country; no parents or aged persons 
remained to be tended by the young, and newcomers among the gods were few in 
number. Sakka (the Bodhisatta), wishing to teach the king a lesson, once 
appeared before him in the guise of an old man, with two jars of butter milk in 
a crazy old cart, having willed that only the king should be able to see him. 
The king was riding his state elephant, and when he asked the old tarter to move 
the latter dashed the two jars on the king’s head and the onlookers laughed to 
see the milk dripping down his face. Resuming Sakka’s form, the Bodhisatta 
admonished the king.</p>
<p>The story was related to account for 
Lakuntaka Bhaddiya’s deformity. J.ii.142-4.</p>
