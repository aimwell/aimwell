<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic of great power. The 
king of Benares, having heard at night four sounds <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
du, sa, na, so <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
uttered by four beings who dwelt in hell, was greatly frightened. When he 
consulted his purohita, the latter ordained a fourfold sacrifice. The 
Bodhisatta, seeing the fate that lay in wait for numerous creatures, went to the 
king’s park and there, with the help of the purohita’s chief disciple 
<span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; not himself in favour of 
the sacrifice — explained to the king the meaning of the sounds and had the 
sacrificial animals released. The purohita’s disciple is identified with 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>, who one night 
heard four syllables uttered by four inhabitants of hell. These had once been 
nobles of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, guilty of adultery. After death they were born in four iron 
cauldrons. After sixty thousand years they had gradually come to the top of 
these cauldrons and had uttered these syllables in their attempt to proclaim 
their misery. The king, very frightened, consulted his priests, who ordered a 
sacrifice. But <a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a> intervened and sent the king to see the Buddha, who 
explained the matter and allayed the king’s fears.</p>
<p>J.iii.43 8; the stories, both of the past and present, 
appear also at DhA.ii.5ff. and PvA.279ff. In both places the introductory story 
gives greater details. Pasenadi heard the sounds while lying sleepless, because 
he contemplated putting a helpless man to death in order to obtain his beautiful 
wife. There are also other differences in the two accounts. For details see 
Burlinghame: Buddhist Legends ii.100, n.1.</p>
