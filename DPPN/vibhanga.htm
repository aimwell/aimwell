  </li>
</ul>
<p>The collective name for two closely connected works of the 
Vinaya Pitaka, which, in manuscripts, are generally called Pārājikā and 
Pācittiya. </p>
<p>The collection is considered to be an extensive treatise 
on the <a href="patimokkha.htm" title="pa/patimokkha.htm">Pātimokkha</a> rules, giving the occasion for the formulating of each rule, 
with some explanation or illustration of various terms employed in the wording 
of the rule. The rule is sometimes further illustrated by reference to cases 
which come within it and to others which form exceptions to it. </p>
<p>The collection is also called Sutta Vibhanga and is 
divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Bhikkhu Vibhanga</li>
  <li>the Bhikkhunī-Vibhanga.</li>
</ul>
