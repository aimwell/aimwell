<p>A king of Kasmira Gandhāra, his capital being Takkasilā. 
One day, while sitting on the terrace of his palace, he saw a woman grinding 
perfume, wearing a jewelled bracelet on each hand. After a while, she put both 
bracelets on one hand and they started jingling. This set the king thinking on 
the virtues of solitude, and he became a Pacceka Buddha. He joined Karandu, 
Dummukha and Nimi, who also became Pacceka Buddhas. J.iii.377,381.</p>
