<hr>
<p><b>1. Sankha. </b>The Bodhisatta, born as a brahmin in 
Molinīnagara (Benares). See the <a href="sankha_jat_442.htm" title="sa/sankha_jat_442.htm">Sankha Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sankha. </b>The Bodhisatta, born as a setthi of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. See the Agampadāna Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sankha. </b>A future king, who will be the 
Cakka-vatti of Ketumatī at the time of the appearance of 
<a href="metteyya.htm" title="me_mu/metteyya.htm">Metteyya</a> Buddha in the 
world. He will raise up again the palace of King Mahāpanāda and live there. But 
later he will give it to the Order and become an arahant. D.iii.75f.; Anāgat. p. 
42 (vs. 10).</p>
<p>According to the Commentary (DA.iii.856), he was one of 
two cane workers (nalakārā), father and son, who made a hut for a Pacceka 
Buddha. After death, both were born in heaven. The son became 
<a href="mahapanaada.htm" title="maha/mahapanaada.htm">Mahāpanāda</a>, and, 
later, <a href="bhaddaji_th.htm" title="b/bhaddaji_th.htm">Bhaddaji</a>. The father is in the deva world and will be reborn as Sankha. Mahāpanāda’s palace still remains un-destroyed, 
ready for his use.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sankha. </b>A Nāga king; a previous birth of <a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula</a>. 
SNA.i.341; but elsewhere (e.g., SA.iii.26) he is called Pālita. See Pālita.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sankha. </b>One of the treasure troves which arose 
from the earth for the use of the Bodhisatta in his last lay life. These 
appeared on the day of his birth. DA.i.284.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sankha.</b> The Bodhisatta born as a brahmin in 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>. He was the father of
<a href="susiima.htm" title="s/susiima.htm">Susīma</a>. See the <a href="sankha_jat_442.htm" title="sa/sankha_jat_442.htm">Sankha Jātaka</a> (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sankha. </b>A general of Kittisirimegha; he lived in 
Badalatthalī. The king entrusted him with the celebrations in connection with 
the upanayana ceremony of Parakkamabāhu (afterwards Parakkamabāhu I.). When 
Parakkamabāhu returned to Badalatthalī in his tour of preparation, Sankha 
welcomed him and paid him all honour. But Parakkamabāhu proved treacherous and 
had him slain. Cv.lxiv.8f., 22f.; lxv.13f, 27f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Sankha.</b> A Singhalese general who maintained a 
stronghold in Gahgādoni in the Manimekhala district, while Māgha ruled in the 
capital. Cv.lxxxi.7f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Sankha Sutta. </b>The Buddha, at the Pāvārika ambavana, 
has a discussion with Asibandhakaputta regarding the teachings of 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha-Nātaputta</a> and proves to him that Nigantha’s teachings are contradictory 
and misleading as compared with his own. The Ariyan disciple, by following the 
Buddha’s teaching, cultivates kindliness, compassion and equanimity and suffuses 
the four quarters with these qualities, as easily as a powerful conch-blower 
fills the four quarters with sound. S.iv.317f.</p>
