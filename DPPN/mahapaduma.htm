<h4><b>1. Mahāpaduma</b></h4>
<p>A Pacceka Buddha, chief of five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, 
all sons of <a href="padumavati.htm" title="pa/padumavati.htm">Padumavatī</a>. He alone was born of his mother’s womb, the others being 
samsedajā. After Padumavatī’s rivals (for the earlier part of their story see 
<a href="uppalavanna.htm" title="u/uppalavanna.htm">Uppalavannā</a>) had placed the children in caskets which they launched down stream, 
they announced to the king that Padumavatī was a non human and had given birth 
to a log of wood. He expelled her from the palace, and as she wandered about in 
the streets, deprived of all her glory, an old woman had pity on her, took her 
home, and looked after her. The king was bathing in the river when the caskets 
containing the children got entangled in his nets, and, having taken them out 
and unlocked them, he found the babes inside, together with a letter from 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> 
saying that they were the children of Padumavatī. The king hastened back to his 
palace and issued a proclamation that anyone finding Padumavatī would receive 
one thousand as reward. On Padumavatī’s suggestion, the old woman, her 
protector, offered to find her, and Padumavatī then revealed herself. She was 
conducted back to the palace in all glory, and her five hundred rivals were 
given to her as slaves. She had them freed, and appointed them as nurses to look 
after her children, except Paduma (called Mahāpaduma), whom she nursed herself. 
When Mahāpaduma and his brothers reached the age of sixteen, they went one day 
to the park, where they were impressed by the appearance of old and faded lotus 
among the fresh ones growing in the pond, and developing this topic of thought, 
they became Pacceka Buddhas and went to Nandamūla cave. Padumavatī died of grief 
at the loss of all her sons and was reborn in a labourer’s family. She married, 
and, one day, while taking gruel to her husband, she saw eight Pacceka Buddhas 
(her sons in a previous birth) travelling through the air and descending near to 
where she stood. She gave them the food intended for her husband and invited 
them for the next day. The next day all the five hundred came to do honour to 
their mother and to accept her entertainment. She fed them all and offered 
flowers to them (ThigA.185ff). Afterwards Mahāpaduma and his brothers were 
entertained by <a href="nanda.htm#11" title="n/nanda.htm#11">Nanda</a>, king of Benares, and his queen (who in their last birth 
were <a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a> and
<a href="bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm" title="b/bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm">Bhaddā Kāpilānī</a>).</p>
<p>They stayed in the royal park during the rains, and, one 
day, when the king was away, the queen visited them and found them dead.

<p><b>2. Mahāpaduma</b></p>
<p>A prince of Kumudanagara. Sona Thera — 
who harboured enmity against Piyadassī Buddha, just as Devadatta did against 
Gotama — persuaded Paduma to kill his father, 
and devised various schemes for killing the Buddha, all of which failed. In the 
end he sent his elephant Donamukha, drunk with toddy, to attack the Buddha, who, 
however, subdued the animal. BuA.174; cp. Ajātasattu.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahāpaduma</b></p>
<p>A Pacceka Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a 
monk, but was later reborn as a Treasurer of Benares, in which life he committed 
adultery and was reborn in hell. Later, he became the daughter of a treasurer 
and was given in marriage. But, owing to her former misdeeds, her husband did 
not care for her and went with another woman to the fair. One day, however, she 
begged her husband to take her, and he told her to make preparations. This she 
did, and on the day of the feast, hearing that her husband had already gone to 
the park, she followed him with her servants, taking the food and drink she had 
prepared. On the way she met a Pacceka Buddha, descended from her carriage, 
filled his bowl with food, placing a lotus on the top, and then offered him a 
handful of lotus. When her gift was accepted, she made a vow that she should be 
born in a lotus and be of a lotus colour, should become a man and attain the 
deliverance of Nibbāna. Her body instantly became beautiful, and her husband, 
who suddenly remembered her, sent for her, and from then on loved her 
exceedingly. After death she was born in a lotus in the deva world and was 
called Mahāpaduma.  </p>
<p>In his next birth, at the suggestion of Sakka, he was born in 
a lotus in the park of the king of Benares, whose queen was childless. She saw 
the lotus in the pond, and conceiving a great affection for it, picked it and 
found the child within as if in a casket. She adopted the child and brought him 
up in great luxury.  </p>
<p>One day, while playing outside the palace gates, he saw a 
Pacceka Buddha and warned him not to enter the palace as they pressed all who 
entered to eat and drink. The Pacceka Buddha turned away, and the boy was filled 
with remorse at the idea that the Pacceka Buddha should be offended, and went to 
his lodging, riding on an elephant, to ask his forgiveness. On the way he 
descended from the elephant and went on foot. Arrived near the dwelling of the 
Pacceka Buddha, he dismissed his attendants and went on alone. He found the 
Pacceka Buddha’s cell empty, and, sitting down, developed insight and became a 
Pacceka Buddha. When his attendants came for him, he declared his attainment.

<p><b>5. Mahāpaduma Thera.</b> Preacher of Jātakas (Jātakabhānaka). 
When Ilanāga was in Rohana, after fleeing from the capital, he heard the 
<a href="kapi_jat_250_404.htm" title="ka/kapi_jat_250_404.htm">Kapi 
Jātaka</a> from <a href="mahapaduma.htm" title="maha/mahapaduma.htm">Mahāpaduma</a>, who lived in Tulādhāra vihāra, and was greatly pleased.

the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa. MT. 524. See also Paduma.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Mahāpaduma Thera. </b></p>
<p>Of Ceylon. Famous for his knowledge of the Vinaya. He was 
a pupil of Upatissa and colleague of Mahāsumma (Sp.i.263).</p>
<p>Mahāpaduma’s opinions are often quoted in the 
Samantapāsādikā. i. 184, 283; ii.368, 471; iii.536, 538, 588, 596, 609, 644, 
651, 683, 715; iv.819, 827, etc.</p>
<p>Once, when Vasabha’s queen was ill, a woman of the court 
was sent to Mahāpaduma for a remedy, he being evidently skilled in medicine. The 
Thera would not prescribe, but explained to his fellow monks what should be done 
in the case of such an illness. The remedy was applied in the case of the queen 
and she recovered. Later, she visited the Thera, and offered him three robes and 
a medicine chest containing three hundred kahāpanas; this she placed at his 
feet, requesting that he should offer flowers in her name. The Elder accepted 
the gift and spent the money on offerings of flowers. Sp.ii.471.</p>
