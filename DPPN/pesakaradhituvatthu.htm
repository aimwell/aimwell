<p>The story of a weaver’s daughter of Ālavi. She heard the 
Buddha preach at the Aggālava cetiya on the necessity of meditating constantly 
on the inevitable ness of death and, though she was only sixteen, she was the 
only one to profit by the sermon. Three years later the Buddha again visited 
Ālavi. The citizens entertained him, but the Buddha would not preach his 
thanksgiving sermon till the weaver’s daughter, having finished the tasks 
required of her by her father, was able to be present. On her arrival the Buddha 
asked her questions so that her wisdom might be known to the assembled populace, 
and, at the conclusion of the Buddha’s discourse, she became a sotāpanna. That 
same day she was killed by an accident to her loom, and her father joined the 
Order, attaining arahantship in due course. DhA.iii.170 6.</p>
