<p>A commentary, also called 
Mātikatthakathā, by Buddhaghosa on the Pātimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka. The 
colophon also contains a summary, a kind of uddāna, of the contents. It is 
stated that the work was written at the request of a thera named Sona, and 
Buddhaghosa declares most emphatically that there is not even a single word in 
the book which is not in conformity with the Canon or the Commentaries of the 
Mahāvihāra (p.204, ed. Hewavitarane Bequest Series; Gv.59, 69.). The Gandhavamsa 
(61f, 71; also Svd.1212) mentions a tīkā on the Kankhāvitaranī named 
Vinayatthamañjūsā, written by Buddhanāga at the request of Sumedha.</p>
