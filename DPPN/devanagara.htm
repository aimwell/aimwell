<p>Also called Devapura. A town at the 
southern point of Ceylon, the modern Dondra. An old vihāra, repaired by 
Vijayabāhu I., existed there (Cv.lx.59). Devanagara is mentioned in the 
campaigns of Parakkamabāhu I. as a scene of conflict (Cv.lxxv.47). There was a 
temple at Devanagara built (by Dappulasena acc. to the Sinhalese poem 
Pārākumbā-Sirita) in honour of the god Uppalavanna. Here Vīrabāhu celebrated a 
sacrifice after his victory over the Jāvakas (Cv.lxxxiii.49). Parakkamabāhu II. 
found the shrine in great decay and rebuilt it with great splendour, and 
inaugurated a festival which is celebrated every year, even up to the present 
day, in the month of Āsālha (Cv.lxxxv.85). Parakkamabāhu IV. built a long-shaped 
temple of two storeys for the recumbent image of the Buddha, which is found in 
the vihāra (Cv.xc.94).</p>
