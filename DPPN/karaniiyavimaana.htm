  <h2>Karanīyavimāna</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A certain layman of Sāvatthi bathed in 
the Aciravatī, and on his return, seeing the Buddha, invited him to a meal. The 
Buddha accepted and was waited on with great devotion. As a result the layman 
was born in Tāvatimsa, in a palace which came to be called Karanīyavimāna.
</p>
<p>A further story is told similar to the 
above, except that the person fed is a monk and not the Buddha (Vv.55; 
VvA.248f).</p>
