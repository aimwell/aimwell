<p>The sāla-grove of the Mallas of <a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusināra</a>, 
on the further side of the <a href="hirannavati.htm" title="h/hirannavati.htm">Hiraññavatī</a>. This was the last resting-place of the 
Buddha on his last tour, and here he passed away, lying on a bed placed between 
two sāla trees (D.ii.137ff; Dpv.xv.70).  </p>
<p>Here <a href="subhadda.htm" title="s/subhadda.htm">Subhadda</a> visited the Buddha in the 
earlier part of the last night of his life, was converted and gained admission 
into the Order, afterwards winning arahantship. (See also DhA.iii.377). It was 
here, too, that the Buddha asked the monks if they had any doubts they wished to 
hear solved regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, magga and patipadā, 
or any questions they wished to ask (A.ii.79), and here he gave his last 
admonition to the monks (S.i.157; see also Ud.37f). Ānanda tried to persuade him 
to die in a place of greater importance, and the Buddha, in order to disabuse 
his mind, preached to him the <a href="mahasudassana_s.htm" title="maha/mahasudassana_s.htm">Mahā Sudassana Sutta</a> (D.ii.169f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.572f) that the 
road to the sāla-grove from the Hiraññavatī led from the further bank of the 
river, like the road from the Kadambanadī to the Thūpārāma in Anurādhapura which 
led through the Rājamātu-vihāra. The row of sāla-trees stretched from south to 
east and then continued to the north (“like the chief street in Anurādhapura”). 
Hence the name Upavattana. The grove was to the southwest of Kusināra. UdA.238.</p>
