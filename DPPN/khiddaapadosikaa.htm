<p>A class of devas who live in the 
Cātummahārājika-world. For ages they spend their time in laughter and in sport 
of sensual lusts. In consequence their self-possession is corrupted and they 
fall from their state (D.i.19; PsA.441; NidA.i.108). They are so called because 
they are corrupted and are destroyed by sport (khiddāya padussanti, vinassanti) 
(DA.i.113). It is said that while playing about in 
such pleasances as Nandanavana, Cittalatāvana and Phārusakavana, they forget to 
eat and drink and fade away like flowers. Their death is due to 
self-consciousness (attasañcetanā) (AA.ii.544). They 
are, as it were, burnt up by their infatuation (mohassa 
anudaha-natāya-mohanavasena hi tesam satisammoso) (VibhA.498). 
They were present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.260).
