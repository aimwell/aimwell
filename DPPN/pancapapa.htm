<p>Daughter of a poor man of Benares. Her hands, feet, mouth, 
eyes and nose were hideous, hence her name (“the Five Defects”); but her touch 
was ecstatic. The reason of all this was that in a previous birth she had given 
clay to a Pacceka Buddha with which to tidy his dwelling, but, on first sight, 
she had looked angrily at him.  </p>
<p>One day she happened to touch <a href="baka.htm" title="b/baka.htm">Baka</a>, king of 
Benares, and he became infatuated with her. He visited her home in disguise and 
married her. Later, wishing to make her his chief consort, but fearing the 
mockery of others because of her ugliness, he devised a plan by which the 
citizens should become aware of her divine touch.  </p>
<p>Afterwards, owing to the 
jealousy of the other queens, she was cast adrift in a vessel and claimed by 
King <a href="pavarika.htm" title="pa/pavarika.htm">Pāvāriya</a>. Baka, hearing of this, wished to fight Pāvāriya, but they agreed 
to compromise, and from that time Pañcapāpā lived for a week at a time in the 
house of each king. The story forms one of the tales related by 
<a href="kunaala.htm" title="ku/kunaala.htm">Kunāla</a>, who is 
identified with <a href="baka.htm" title="b/baka.htm">Baka</a>. J.v.440ff.</p>
