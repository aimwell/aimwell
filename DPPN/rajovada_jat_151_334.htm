<h4>1. Rājovāda Jātaka (No. 151)</h4>
<p>Two kings, Brahmadatta of Benares (the Bodhisatta) and Mallika of Kosala, 
while journeying in disguise, in order to discover if anyone in their respective 
kingdoms could tell them of any faults which they (the kings) possessed, meet in 
a narrow path, and a dispute arises among the charioteers as to who should give 
place. It is discovered that both are of the same age and power. Each driver 
sings the praises of his own master, but then they discover that Mallika is good 
to the good and bad to the bad, while Brahmadatta is good to both the good and 
the bad. Mallika’s charioteer acknowledges Brahmadatta as the superior and gives 
place.</p>
<p>The story is related to Pasenadi, who comes to the Buddha after having had to 
decide a difficult case involving moral turpitude. He is satisfied that he has 
done well, and the Buddha agrees with him that to administer justice with 
impartiality is the way to heaven.</p>
<p>Mallika is identified with Ānanda and his driver with Moggallāna, while 
Brahmadatta’s driver is Sāriputta. J.ii.1ff.</p>

<h4>2. Rājovāda Jātaka (No. 334)</h4>
<p>Once the king of Benares, wishing to discover if he ruled justly, traveled 
about in disguise, and, in the course of his wanderings, came to the Himālaya, 
where the Bodhisatta lived as an ascetic. The ascetic gave him ripe figs, and, 
when asked why they were so sweet, explained that the king of the country was 
evidently a just ruler. The king returned to his kingdom and ruled for a while 
unjustly; and returning again to the hermitage, he found that the figs had 
become bitter.</p>
<p>The story was related to Pasenadi, in order to show the importance of a king 
ruling wisely and justly. Ānanda is identified with the king of the story. 
J.iii.110 12; cp. Mahākapi Jātaka (No. 407).</p>
