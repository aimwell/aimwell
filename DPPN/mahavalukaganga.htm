<h2>Mahāvālukagangā, Mahāgangā, Mahāvālukanadī</h2>
<p>The chief river of Ceylon, the modern Mahāveliganga. 
Viewed from the city of Anurādhapura, the right bank was called pāragangā and 
the left oragangā. The river was of great strategic importance, and is mentioned 
in various accounts of campaigns between opposing armies. It was always regarded 
as the boundary between North Ceylon, with Anurādhapura (and later, Pulatthipura) 
as the centre, and the South east province of Rohana. </p>
<p>Various fords on this river are mentioned in the books, 
the chief among these being Kacchakatittha, Ganthambatittha, Mahārukkhatittha, 
Mālāgāmatittha, Yakkhasūkaratittha, Sarogāmatittha, Sahassatittha and 
Suvannatthambhatittha. There were evidently other fords at the bends of the 
river with no particular names (e.g., Cv.lxxii.285). </p>
<p>The kings of Ceylon constructed various canals branching 
off from the river to help in their irrigation schemes. One such was the 
Pabbatanta Canal, built by Mahāsena (Mhv.xxxvii.50); while the Aciravatī, the 
Gomatī, and the Malāpaharani were constructed by Parakkamabāhu I. 
(Cv.lxxix.51f). Dhātusena irrigated the surrounding fields by means of damming 
up the river (Cv.xxxviii.12), as did Sena II. by the construction of the 
Manimekhala dam (Cv.li.72). In the time of Parakkamabāhu II. and, later, of 
Vijayabāhu IV., great ordination ceremonies were held on the river at 
Sahassatittha (Cv.lxxxvii.72; lxxxix.70f), and again at Ganthambatittha in the 
time of Vimaladhammasūriya I. Cv.xciv.17; also Vimaladhammasūriya II. 
(Cv.xcvii.12). </p>
<p>The river rises in Samantakūta (Cv.c.82). The Mahānāgavana 
of the Yakkhas, where, later, was erected the Mahiyangathūpa, was on the right 
bank of the river. Cv.lxxxix.70; Mhv.Trs., p.3.</p>
