<p>1. Thullakotthita.-A township in the 
Kuru country. It was the birthplace of Ratthapāla, and it was there that the 
Buddha stayed during a tour among the Kurus (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30; AA.i.144). It 
received its name from the fact of its granaries being always full (thullakottham, 
paripunnakotthāgāram). It had plenteous crops. MA.ii.722; also Avadāna S.ii.118.</p>
<p>2. Thullakotthita.-A city in the time of
