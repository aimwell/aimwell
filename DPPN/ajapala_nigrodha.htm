<p>A banyan tree which is famous in 
Buddhist literature. It was in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the 
Bodhi tree, and a week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a 
week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhunkajātika 
Brahmin (Vin.i.2-3). Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana 
(Vin.i.4). It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded 
him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task (Vin.i.5-7; 
in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, says Buddhaghosa, SA.i.152). This 
was immediately after the meal offered by Tapassu and Bhalluka, so says the 
Majjhima Atthakathā (i.385; J.i.81). When the Buddha wishes to have someone as 
his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be 
considered his teacher (A.ii.20f.; S.i.138f).</p>
<p>By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, 
immediately after the Enlightenment, Mara tried to persuade the Buddha to die at 
once (D.ii.112). Several other conversations held here with Mara are recorded in 
the Samyutta (S.i.103f).</p>
<p>Here, also, the Buddha spent some time 
before the Enlightenment (D.ii.267), and it was here that Sujata offered him a 
meal of milk-rice (J.i.16, 69).</p>
<p>Here, in the fifth week after the 
Enlightenment, Mara’s daughters tried to tempt the Buddha (J.i.78, 469).'</p>
<p>Several etymologies are suggested for 
the name: (a) in its shadow goatherds (ajapālā) rest; (b) old brahmins, 
incapable of reciting the Vedas, live here in dwellings protected by walls and 
ramparts (this derivation being as follows: na japantī ti =ajapā, mantānam 
anajjhāyakā=ajapā, ālenti arīyanti nivāsam etthāti=Ajapālo ti); (c) it shelters 
the goats that seek its shade at midday (UdA.51). The northern Buddhists say 
that the tree was planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta’s six years' 
penance, to shelter him (Beal, Romantic Legend of Buddha,192, 238; Mtu.iii.302).</p>
<p>The Brahmā Sutta (S.v.167) and the Magga 
Sutta (S.v.185), both on the four satipatthāna, and another Brahmā Sutta 
(S.v.232f) on the five indriyāni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the 
Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon 
after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him 
and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the 
Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he 
did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karanā dhamma. 
A.ii.22.</p>
