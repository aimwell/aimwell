</ul>
<p>A Yakkha. </p>
<p>It is said that whoever, even up to the third time of 
being asked, refuses to answer a reasonable question put by a Buddha, his head 
will split into pieces on the spot. It was Vajirapāni’s duty to frighten such 
people by appearing before them in the sky, armed with a thunderbolt, which he 
was ready to hurl if necessary. He was visible only to the Buddha and the person 
in question. </p>
<p>Two instances of this are given in the books — 
once in the case of Ambattha, (D.i.95; cf. the story in the Ayakūta Jātaka) and 
again in that of Saccaka Niganthaputta (M.i.231). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.264; MA.i.457; cp. Dvy.130) that 
Vajirapāni is identical with Sakka, and proceeds to describe the fierce 
appearance assumed by him on these occasions. This arrangement was made in 
fulfilment of a promise made by Sakka, in the presence of Mahā Brahmā, when the 
Buddha was reluctant to preach the Dhamma (See Vin.i.5f), that if the Buddha 
would establish his rule of the Dhamma (Dhammacakka), Sakka would afford it the 
necessary protection. </p>
<p>In some places (E.g., Cv.xcvi.37; see also J.R.A.S. 1916, 
p.733f), Vajirapāni’s conquest of the Asuras is alluded to, thus establishing 
his identity with Indra. See also Vajirahattha.</p>
