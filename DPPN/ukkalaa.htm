  <h2>Ukkalā</h2>

</ul>
<p>A district (janapada) in the region identified with modern Orissa (CAG., p.733). The merchants <a href="tapassu.htm" title="t/tapassu.htm">Tapassu</a> and <a href="bhallika.htm" title="b/bhallika.htm">Bhalluka</a> 
were on the way from Ukkalā, when a certain deva, an erstwhile relative of 
theirs, advised them to visit the Buddha at Rājāyatanamūla, near 
<a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a>, and to 
offer food to him, which they did (Vin.i.4). They were on the way to Majjhimadesa (J.i.80). According to the Theragāthā Commentary (i.48f) there were 
caravan drivers of a city called Pokkharavatī (probably a town in Ukkalā). Their 
destination was evidently <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, for we find them visiting the Buddha there 
after the first sermon and hearing him preach.</p>
<p>The men of Ukkalā, together with those 
of <a href="vassa.htm" title="va/vassa.htm">Vassa</a> and <a href="bhanna.htm" title="b/bhanna.htm">Bhañña</a>, are represented as being deniers of cause and effect, 
deniers of reality (ahetuvādā, akiriyavādā, natthikavādā). (A.ii.31; S.iii.72; 
M.iii.78; Kvu.60; AA.ii.497; see also KS.iii.63, and GS.ii.34, n.3).</p>
<p>The Mahāvastu (iii.303) places Ukkalā in 
the Uttarāpatha and mentions Adhisthāna as the place from which Tapussa and 
Bhalluka hailed.</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata (E.g., in Bhīsmapārvan 
ix.365; Drona iv.122) mentions the Ukkalas several times in lists of tribes (va. 
Okkalā).</p>
