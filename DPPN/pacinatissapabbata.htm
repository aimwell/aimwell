</ul>
<p>A monastery in Ceylon, built by Jetthatissa and given to 
the monks of the “five settlements.” The stone image set up by Devānampiyatissa 
in the Thūpārāma was transferred to this vihāra by Jetthatissa (Mhv.xxxvi.127, 
129). Mahāsena had it brought from there to the Abhayagiri vihāra 
(Ibid.,xxxvii.14). Near the monastery was the mountain, Pācīna tissapabbata, 
where an engagement took place between Kassapa, son of Upatissa III., and 
Silākāla (Cv.xli.14). Later, at the same spot, took place the decisive battle 
between Sanghatissa and Moggallāna III. Ibid.,xliv.14ff.</p>
