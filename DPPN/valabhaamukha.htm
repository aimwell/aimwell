<p>A sea (samudda), the last of those seen by Suppāraka on 
his voyage. Here the water is sucked away and rises on every side, leaving in 
the centre what looks like a deep pit. Suppāraka, by an Act of Truth, prevented 
his ship from being sunk there (see the Suppāraka Jātaka). It is also called 
Valabhāmukhī. J.iv.142.</p>
