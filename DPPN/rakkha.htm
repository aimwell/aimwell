<h4>1. Rakkha</h4>
<p>A general of Parakkamabāhu I. He was originally the Dandādhināyaka (? 
general) of Gajabāhu, but Parakkamabāhu won him over and put him in charge of 
the conquest of the Malaya country. He accomplished this with the help of his 
younger brother, after fighting many battles and subduing the chiefs of the 
various districts (Cv.lxx.5ff). The king thereupon conferred on him the rank of 
Kesadhātu. Later, he subdued the district of Merukandara and was sent against 
the Mahālekha Mahinda, whom he defeated at Sarogāmatittha. He was associated 
with Nagaragiri Nātha in the fight against Mānābharana near Badaravallī. After 
this he is referred to as Adhikārī Rakkha, and the war against Mānābharana seems 
to have been chiefly in his charge. He was in command of the army at 
Mangalabegāma and Mihiranabibbila, and decisively defeated Mānābharana’s 
general, Buddhanāyaka at Rajatakedāra. Later, when Queen Sugalā raised a revolt 
in Rohana, it was Rakkha who was sent to crush it. He was by now commander in 
chief, and was helped in the subjugation of Rohana by the general Bhūta. They 
fought a battle at Lokagalla and advanced to Majjhimagāma and occupied 
Uddhanadvāra, where Rakkha was helped by the two Kittis, the Adhikāri and the 
Jīvapotthakī. From there they marched to Mahārīvara, and at Badaguna crushed 
Sugalā’s forces, thus gaining possession of the Sacred Bowl and the Sacred Tooth 
which these forces were carrying. In a last onslaught at Dematavala, Rakkha put 
the enemy to flight and marched on to Sappanārukokilla, where he died of an 
attack of dysentery. Cv.lxx. 5, 15, 19, 282, 295; lxxii.2ff., 107, 160, 207, 
232, 265ff.; lxxiv. 41ff. 55, 72ff., 111ff., 136ff.</p>

<h4>2. Rakkha</h4>
<p>called Lankādhinātha. A general of Parakkamabāhu I. He helped Lokajitvāna to 
defeat Hukitti, and was later sent to Janapada to fight against Gajabāhu’s 
forces. He was successful, and occupied Yagālla and Talātthala. Gajabāhu tried 
to win him over with bribes, but Rakkha mutilated the envoys and sent the 
presents to Parakkamabāhu. He fought at Aligāma against Gajabāhu’s general, Sīka, 
and, proving victorious, held a great celebration. Later he was in charge of the 
successful attack on Pulatthipura, when the city was captured and Gajabāhu taken 
prisoner. He was then sent to Mangalabegāma against Mānābharana, and fought so 
fiercely that the latter was forced to flee to Rohana. Rakkha was placed in 
charge of the ford at Nigundivālukā. He was, however, greatly offended by the 
favour shown by Parakkamabāhu to his rival, the Senāpati Deva, and no longer 
showed himself zealous in war. An officer of Gajabāhu who was with Rakkha, 
noticing this, sent word to Mānābharana to come at once and take advantage of 
Rakkha’s lethargy. Mānābharana followed this advice and advanced against Rakkha, 
whom he killed in the course of a fierce battle. Cv.lxx. 24, 98ff., 115ff., 174, 
232, 283, 297, 306; lxxii.37, 75ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Rakkha</h4>
<p>called Mahālekha. He was an officer of Parakkamabāhu I. and took part in the 
campaigns against Mānābharana, being stationed at Mangalabegāma, at Pillavitthi. 
At this place he fought a battle, which lasted for eight days, against 
Buddhanāyaka and Mahāmāladeva, and brought the district of Kālavāpi under his 
power. Cv.lxxii.161, 170ff., 182, 206.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Rakkha</h4>
<p>called Damilādhikāri. He was an officer of Parakkamabāhu I., and was one of 
those chiefly responsible for the subjugation of Rohana. He fought battles at 
Donivagga, Guralatthakalañcha, Pūgadandakāvāta, Bodhiāvāta, Bhinnālavanāgāma and 
several other places, and inflicted severe defeats on the rebel forces, dealing 
them a severe blow at Mahāsenagāma, where Lankāpura Rakkha was killed. This 
enabled him to take possession of Mahānāgahula. In order to bring the province 
completely under his control he had to fight further at Bakagalla Uddhavāpi, 
Sanghabhedakagāma, Kuravakagalla and Mahāpabbata, and he thus won full 
possession of Dvādasasahassaka, where he seems to have spent the rest of his 
days. Cv.lxxv.20, 69ff., 74ff., 87 159.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Rakkha Kañcukīnāyaka</h4>
<p>An officer of Parakkamabāhu I., associated with Damilādhikārī Rakkha. He 
fought victorious battles at Mahāvālukagāma, Devanagara, Kammāragāma, 
Mahāpanālagāma, Mānakapitthi, Nīlavalā Ford and Kadalīpatta, and marching then 
through Mārāvaratthali, he assisted Damilādhikārī Rakkha in the capture of 
Mahānāgahula. Cv.lxxv. 20ff., 35ff., 52ff., 116.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Rakkha Lankāpura</h4>
<p>One of the leaders of the rebels in Rohana in the time of Parakkamabāhu I. He 
was later made their commander in chief. He advanced with his forces to 
Nadībhandagāma, and was killed in the battle at Mahāsenagāma, fighting against 
Damilādhikārī Rakkha. His place in the army was taken by his elder brother. 
Cv.lxxv.70, 103, 112, 134.</p>
