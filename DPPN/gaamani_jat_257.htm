  <h2>Gāmani-Canda Jātaka (No.257)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as 
Ādāsamukha, son of Janasandha, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Ādāsamukha became king at the 
age of seven, having successfully solved the problems set him by his courtiers. 
 
</p>
<p>Janasandha had a servant named Gāmani-Canda who, being old, retired when 
Ādāsamukha came to the throne. But various mishaps befell Gāmani-Canda, and he 
was charged on various counts by different people. As he was being brought to 
the king to receive punishment, he was asked by several persons to convey 
messages to the king, and to find out from him solutions for their troubles.  </p>
<p>The 
king listened to the charges brought against Gāmani and to his explanation of 
them. Convinced of Gāmani’s innocence, he passed sentences which ultimately 
brought gain to Gāmani. The king then proceeded to solve the problems contained 
in the messages brought by Gāmani. He gave to Gāmani the village in which he 
lived, free from all taxes, and there Gāmani lived happily to the end of his 
days.</p>
<p>The story was told by the Buddha to 
certain monks who had been discussing his wisdom.</p>
<p>Gāmani-Canda is identified with Ānanda. 
In the story he is referred to also as Gāmani, Canda-Gāmani and Canda. 
J.ii.297-310.</p>
