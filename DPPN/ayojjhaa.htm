<p>1. Ayojjhā.-A city of the Ganges (but 
see below in this article). Two visits of the Buddha to this city are recorded 
in the Canon; on one occasion he preached the Phena Sutta (S.iii.140ff ) and on 
the other the Dārukkhandha Sutta (S.iv.179f). In both these references the city 
is said to be on the Ganges; the town usually called Ayojjhā (Ayodhya) is 
certainly not on this river. The records, therefore, go back either to a 
confused or an unintelligent tradition (see Thomas: op. cit., 15; cf. Sāketa), 
or may possibly refer to another settlement made by colonists from the original 
Ayojjhā. It is worthy of note that in the Dārukkhandha Sutta some of the MSS. 
read Kosambī for Ayojjhā. But even Kosambī (q.v.) was on the Jumnā and not on 
the Ganges.</p>
<p>During the Buddhist period, Ayojjhā on 
the Sarayū was the capital of Dakkhina Kosala, the janapada roughly 
corresponding to modern Oudh. This, the Ayodhyā of the Ramayana, is about a mile 
from the modern Fyzabad. In the Jātaka Commentary (J.iv.82) there is a mention 
of Ayojjhā, which here evidently refers to the city of the Sanskrit epics. It is 
called the capital of King Kālasena. It was besieged by the Andhavenhuputtā, who 
breached the wall and took the king prisoner. Having thus subjugated the city, 
they went to Dvāravatī.</p>
<p>The Dīpavamsa (iii.15) mentions 
Ayujjhanagara as the capital of King Arindama and of fifty-five of his 
descendants.</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.233-4), 
the people of Ayujjhanagara built for the Buddha a vihāra in a spot surrounded 
by forest near a curve of the river. Once a warrior named Jagatipāla, of the 
race of Rāma, came to Ceylon from Ayojjhā, and having slain Vikkampandu, the 
heir-apparent to the throne, ruled in Rohana for five years. Cv.lvi.13ff.</p>

<p>2. Ayojjhā.-Capital of Siam. From there 
Vijayarājasīha, King of Ceylon, obtained monks for his own country 
(Cv.xcviii.91f). A few years later his successor, Kittisirirājasīha, sent an 
embassy there for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The King of Siam showed the embassy 
every mark of favour and granted them the monks. The monks, who came from 
Ayojjhā to Ceylon, re-established the ordination of monks in the Island. 
Cv.xcviii.60-139; see also J.R.A.S. (Ceylon Branch), 1903, No.54, pp.17ff.</p>
