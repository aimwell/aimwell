<p><b>1. Uposatha.</b>-King, son of Varakalyāna 
and an ancestor of the Sākyan tribe. His son was Mandhātā (Dpv.iii.4). He was 
one of the kings at the beginning of the kappa (J.ii.311; iii.454). In the Dīgha 
Commentary (DA.i.258) he is given as the son of Varamandhātā and the father of 
Cara. In the northern texts he is called Uposadha. Mtu.i.348; Divy.210.</p>

<p><b>2. Uposatha.</b>-The name of the 
Elephant-Treasure of the <a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a>
<a href="mahasudassana_s.htm" title="maha/mahasudassana_s.htm">Mahāsudassana</a>. He was “all white, sevenfold 
firm (sattappatittha), wonderful in power, flying through the sky.” (D.ii.174; 
M.iii.173f). In the Lalita Vistara his name is given as Bodhi.</p>
<p>Uposatha is also the name of a tribe of 
elephants, the ninth in a series of ten tribes, of ascending importance 
(DA.ii.573; UdA.403). It is said that a cakkavatti’s elephant belongs either to 
the Chaddanta tribe or to the Uposatha. If a Chaddanta elephant comes to a 
cakkavatti, it is the youngest of the tribe that comes, if an Uposatha elephant, 
then it will be the foremost (DA.ii.624; J.iv.232, 234; KhA.172). When the 
cakkavatti dies, the elephant goes back to his fellows (DA.ii.635). The strength 
of an Uposatha elephant is equal to that of one thousand million men (BuA.37). 
In the Milindapañha (p.282), the king of the Uposatha elephants is described as 
being gentle and handsome, eight cubits in height and nine in girth and length, 
chewing signs of rut in three places on his body, all white, sevenfold-firm. 
Just as this elephant could never be put into a cow-pen or covered with a 
saucer, so could no one keep as slaves the children of Vessantara.</p>

<p><b>3. Uposatha.</b>-Known as Uposatha-kumāra. 
The eldest of the ninety nine brothers of Samvara, king of Benares. When Samvara 
ascended the throne, his brothers protested and laid siege to his city; but 
Uposatha, having discovered by means of questions put to Samvara, that he was in 
character by far the best suited for kingship, persuaded the others to renounce 
their claims to the throne. Uposatha is identified with Sāriputta. J.iv.133ff.</p>
