<p>1. Kāla.-Son of Anāthapindika.-As he 
showed no signs of piety his father, feeling very distressed, made a solemn 
promise to give him a thousand if he kept the fast-day. Kāla won the money, and 
the next day he was promised a thousand if he would listen to the Buddha 
preaching and learn a single verse of the Dhamma. He listened to the Buddha’s 
sermon, but by the will of the Buddha he could not keep in mind a single verse 
until the sermon came to an end. He then became a sotāpanna and accompanied the 
Buddha and the monks to his father’s house. There, when in the presence of them 
all Anāthapindika gave Kāla the money, he refused to accept it, and the Buddha 
explained what had happened. DhA.iii.189ff</p>
<p>2. Kāla.-An Elder. A certain woman 
ministered to him as though he were her son, but when she expressed her desire 
to see the Buddha, Kāla tried to dissuade her from doing so. One day she visited 
the Buddha without telling Kāla of her intention, and when he learnt where she 
had gone he hurried to the Buddha and tried to prevent him from preaching to 
her, in case she should stop caring for him. DhA.iii.155f</p>
<p>3. Kāla.-Minister of Pasenadi. He was 
grieved when the king spent his fortune in giving alms to the Buddha and his 
monks at the Asadisa-dāna ; the Buddha, knowing his thoughts, spoke but a single 
stanza by way of thank offering at the end of the dāna lest Kāla’s head should 
split in seven pieces in anger. When the king learnt, on inquiry, why the Buddha 
had so acted, he dismissed Kāla from his service. DA.ii.654f; 
DhA.iii.186-8; also ii.89.</p>
<p>4. Kāla.-An Elder of Kosala. He joined 
the Order in his old age and lived in the forest with his friend Junha. Once the 
question arose between them as to which part of the month was cold, and being 
unable to decide the question, they sought the Buddha, who preached to them the 
Māluta Jātaka (q.v.). (J.i.165)</p>
<p>5. Kāla. The name given by his wife to 
the Ājīvaka Upaka (ThigA.i.223) because he was dark in complexion (ThigA.i.226).</p>
<p>6. Kāla.-King of the Nāgas; see Mahākāla.</p>
<p>7. Kāla.-A young stag, son of the 
Bodhisatta; a previous birth of Devadatta. The story is given in the Lakkhana 
Jātaka. J.i.142f</p>
<p>8. Kāla.-See Kālahatthi.</p>
<p>9. Kāla.-One of the Nirayas. J.vi.248.</p>
<p>10. Kāla.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in 
a list of Pacceka Buddhas. M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.</p>
<p>11. Kāla.-Brother of Pasenadi, king of 
Kosala. Dvy.153.</p>
<p>12. Kāla.-See also Cullakāla, Mahā-Kāla 
and Kāludāyī.</p>
