<p>The story, mentioned in the Mahāummaga 
Jātaka (J.vi.346f), of the chameleon to whom the king gave one halfpenny’s worth 
of meat a day for having shown him deference. One fast-day there was no meat to 
be had, and the man who supplied it tied the money round the chameleon’s neck. 
The next time the animal saw the king it refused to salute him, because it felt 
itself to be his equal on account of the wealth round its neck.</p>
