<p>Once when the Bodhisatta was a rich 
treasurer in Benares a son was born to him. A female slave in the house gave 
birth to a son on the same day. The boys grew up together, the slave’s son being 
called Katāhaka. Katāhaka acquired various arts in the company of his master. 
When he grew up he was appointed as the Treasurer’s private secretary. One day 
he visited a merchant on the frontier, carrying a letter purporting to be from 
the Treasurer (in which he was stated to be the son of the latter), asking for 
the hand of the merchant’s daughter in marriage. The merchant was overjoyed, and 
the marriage took place. Katāhaka gave himself great airs and spoke 
contemptuously of everything “provincial.” The Treasurer, discovering what had 
happened, decided to visit the merchant, but Katāhaka went to meet him on the 
way, and paying him all the honour due from a slave, begged him not to expose 
him. Meanwhile, he had misled his wife’s relations into the belief that the 
homage, paid by him to the Treasurer, was but the regard due from a son to his 
father. He was not like the sons of other parents, but knew what was due to his 
father. The Bodhisatta, being pleased, did not expose the slave, but on learning 
from Katāhaka’s wife that Katāhaka always complained of his food, he taught her 
a stanza which contained the threat — not intelligible to her, though clear to 
Katāhaka — that if Katāhaka continued to make a nuisance of himself, the 
Treasurer would return and expose him. Thenceforth Katāhaka held his peace.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk who used to boast of his high lineage and the wealth of his family until 
his pretensions were exposed (J.i.451ff).</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary 
(DhA.iii.357ff), the story was told in reference to a monk named Tissa who would 
complain, no matter what attentions were paid to him.</p>
