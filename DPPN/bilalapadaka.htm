<p>A rich man of Sāvatthi. Once a resident of Sāvatthi 
invited the Buddha and all his monks to a meal and went from house to house 
asking the householders to share in the almsgiving. Bilālapādaka, annoyed at the 
request, gave only as much as could be grasped by three fingers — 
hence his name — (“cat foot”). The man took the 
gifts and added them to the others, but Bilālapādaka, suspecting that he might 
be disgraced in public, went to the almsgiving with a knife concealed on his 
person, ready to kill the man if he should mention his gift in ridicule. But he 
heard the man offer the alms to the Buddha, expressing the wish that all who had 
joined in the almsgiving should receive a rich reward. Moved by the man’s 
largeness of heart, Bilālapāda fell at his feet, confessing his guilty 
intentions and begging for pardon. The Buddha thereupon preached to Bilālapāda, 
who, at the conclusion of the sermon, became a sotāpanna. DhA.iii.17ff.</p>
