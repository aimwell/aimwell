<p>A shrine in the neighbourhood of 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, to the north of 
that city (D.iii.9). The Buddha is said to have stayed there (D.ii.118;, 
Ud.vi.1; S.v.259). It was a pre Buddhist shrine and, according to the 
Commentaries (E.g., UdA.323; SA.ii.128, etc.), was a many branched nigrodha tree 
where persons prayed for sons to the deva of the tree. Hence its name.</p>
<p><a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a> says that while yet a “learner” he paid 
homage to the Buddha at a Bahuputtaka-nigrodha where 
the Buddha had gone to meet him. The Buddha taught him of the training to be 
followed and, profiting by the lesson, eight days later Mahā Kassapa became an 
arahant. This nigrodha, however, was on the road from <b>
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a></b> to <b>
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a></b> and was three leagues from Rājagaha*. It cannot, therefore, have 
been identical with the tree, which gave its name to the Bahuputta cetiya.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* S.ii.220; see <b>Mahā Kassapa</b>. It was here that 
  the Buddha exchanged his robe for that of Kassapa, SA.ii.128; ThagA.ii.145; 
  AA.i.102; Mtu.iii.50.</p>
