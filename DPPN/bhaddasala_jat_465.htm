<p>Brahmadatta, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, wishing to have a palace 
built on one column, sent his carpenters to find a suitable tree. They found 
many such in the forest, but no road by which to transport them. At last they 
discovered a lordly sāla tree in the king’s park and made preparations to cut it 
down. The deity of the tree (Bhaddasāla 2), who was the Bodhisatta, was greatly 
distressed at the prospect of the destruction of his children. He, therefore, 
visited the king by night and begged him not to have the tree cut down. When the 
king refused this request, Bhaddasāla asked that the tree should be cut down in 
pieces, so that in its fall it might not damage its kindred round about. This 
feeling of Bhaddasāla for his kinsmen touched the king, and he desisted from his 
purpose of destroying the tree.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s 
interference with Vidūdabha (q.v.) when he wished to destroy the Sākyans.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with the king (J.iv.153 7). On this 
occasion was preached also the Kukkura Jātaka (No.22), the Kāka Jātaka (No.140), 
and the Mahākapi Jātaka (No.407).</p>
