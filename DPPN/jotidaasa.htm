<p>A wealthy brahmin of Pādiyattha (Pāniyattha). 
One day, seeing Mahā Kassapa going for alms, he entertained the Elder and 
requested him to preach. On a hill near the village Jotidāsa built a vihāra for 
Kassapa and provided him with the requisites. Moved by the Elder’s teaching, he 
left the world and soon after became an arahant. After ten years — during which 
he learnt the Three Pitakas, being specially proficient in the Vinaya — while on 
his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha, he entered a Paribbājakārāma, and there 
had a discussion with the Paribbājakas on how to burn away evil. At the end of 
the discussion, they were ordained under him.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
householder and, seeing the Buddha, offered him a kāsumārika-fruit (Thag.143-4; 
ThagA.i.264f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Kāsumāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna ii.445. But see Sīvaka.</p>
