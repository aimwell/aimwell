<p>One of the chief warriors of Dutthagāmani. He was the 
nephew of Mitta, one of Elāra’s generals. His genitals were hidden in his body, 
and he had the strength of ten elephants. When he was a baby, he was wont to 
wander about, and so was tied to a mill atone by a strap (nandhi), but he 
dragged the stone after him. In Anurādhapura he slew the Damilas who desecrated 
the temples, but later he joined the Singhalese soldiers in Rohana and fought in 
Dutthagāmanī’s campaigns. Mhv.xxiii.2ff.; xxv.21ff.; MA.ii.688; DA.i.90.</p>
