<p>A brick hall at Nādikā (Ñātikā). The 
Buddha stayed there on various occasions during his visits to Nādikā. It was 
during one of these visits that <a href="ambapaalii.htm" title="am/ambapaalii.htm">Ambapāli</a> presented her park to the Buddha and 
the Order (Vin.i.232).  </p>
<p>In the Giñjakāvasatha the Buddha preached the 
<a href="cuula_gosinga_s.htm" title="c/cuula_gosinga_s.htm">Cūlagosinga 
Sutta</a> (M.i.205), the <a href="janavasabha.htm" title="j/janavasabha.htm">Janavasabha Sutta</a> (D.ii.200) and several discourses on marana-sati (E.g., A.iii.303f; 306f; 391f; iv.320f); also the sermons to the 
Elder <a href="sandha.htm" title="sa/sandha.htm">Sandha</a> of the <a href="kaccaana.htm" title="ka/kaccaana.htm">Kaccānagotta</a> (A.v.322f) and the Elder 
<a href="kaccaayana.htm" title="ka/kaccaayana.htm">Kaccāyana</a> (S.ii.153f; 
see also S.ii.74; iv.90).  </p>
<p>Both in the Janavasabha Sutta and the <a href="ginjakaavasatha_s.htm" title="g/ginjakaavasatha_s.htm">Giñjakāvasatha 
Sutta</a> (S.v.356f), which was preached at the same place, the Buddha is 
represented as having answered questions regarding the destiny and the rebirth 
of several residents of Nādikā. Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nādikā 
were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by 
way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached 
to Ānanda at Giñjakāvasatha the Dhammā-dāsa (Mirror of Truth) on his last visit 
to Nādikā, as described in the <a href="mahaparinibbana_s.htm" title="maha/mahaparinibbana_s.htm">Mahā 
Parinibbāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.91ff; see also S.v.357).</p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.424) state 
that once the Buddha arrived at Nādikā while travelling in the Vajji country, 
and the people there built for him a residence entirely made of bricks (giñjakā), 
hence its name. Later, residences were also built for the monks, complete with 
all requirements. The bricks were evidently a special architectural feature, and 
this con-firms the belief that buildings were generally of wood. The “Brick 
Hall” was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find 
mention of members of other sects staying there — e.g., the Paribbājaka 
<a href="sabhiya.htm" title="sa/sabhiya.htm">Sabhiya 
Kaccāna</a> (S.iv.401). The building was probably a resting place for all travellers.</p>
