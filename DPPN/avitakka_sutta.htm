<p>1. Avitakka Sutta.-Ānanda, seeing 
Sāriputta, remarks on his calm demeanour and his translucent colour and asks him 
how they came about. Sāriputta explains that he had spent the day in the second 
jhāna, in single-pointedness of mind, apart from thought applied and sustained (avitakka 
avicāra). S.iii.236.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Avitakka Sutta.-Moggallāna tells the 
monks how he had obtained the second jhāna with the assistance of the Buddha. 
S.iv.263.</p>
