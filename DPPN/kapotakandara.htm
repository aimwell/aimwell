<p>A grotto, probably near Rājagaha, where, 
later, a vihāra, called the Kapotakondara-vihāra, was built. The grotto was at 
one time the residence of a large number of pigeons (kapotā), hence the name 
(UdA.244). On one occasion Sāriputta, having recently shaved his head, was 
seated there wrapt in samādhi, and a yakkha, passing overhead with his friend to 
an assembly of yakkhas, yielded, despite the warning of his friend, to the 
temptation to give a knock on the monk’s shining head. The yakkha immediately 
fell down and was swallowed up in the fires of hell. Sāriputta had but a slight 
headache after the blow, which was, it is said, heavy enough to crush an 
elephant (Ud.39f; Thag.vs.998f; PsA.494).</p>
<p>According to the Visuddhi-magga (p.380), 
Sāriputta entered into a trance at the very moment the blow was dealt him.</p>
