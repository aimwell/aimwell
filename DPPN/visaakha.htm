<p><b>1. Visākha. </b>Husband of <a href="dhammadinnaa.htm" title="d/dhammadinnaa.htm">Dhammadinnā</a>. He was a rich 
merchant of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and accompanied 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> on his visit to the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, who 
was then at Rājagaha for the first time after his Enlightenment. Visākha, on 
that occasion, became a Sotāpanna, after hearing the Buddha preach; he later 
became a sakadāgāmī and then an anāgāmī. After he became an anāgāmī his 
behaviour to his wife completely changed, and when he explained to her the 
reason, offering her all his wealth and freedom to do as she wished, she asked 
his leave to join the Order. Visākha informed Bimbisāra of her wish, and, at his 
request, the king ordered that the city be decked in her honour on the day of 
her renunciation and that she be taken to the nunnery in a golden palanquin.</p>
<p>After Dhammadinnā had joined the Order, she left the city 
and retired into the country, returning to Rājagaha after she had attained 
arahantship. Visākha, hearing of her return, visited her at the nunnery and 
asked her various questions regarding the Buddha’s teachings, all of which she 
answered (MA.i.514f.; ThigA.15, 19). Their conversation is recorded in the
<a href="cuula_vedalla_s.htm" title="c/cuula_vedalla_s.htm">Culla Vedalla Sutta</a> (M.i.299f.; cf. DhA.iv.229f.; AA.i.197). Visākha then 
visited the Buddha and reported their conversation to him, winning the Buddha’s 
praises for Dhammadinnā.</p>
<p>In the time of Phussa Buddha, Visākha and Dhammadinnā had 
been husband and wife. (For details see PvA.20ff.; of. KhpA.202f.; DhA.i.86f. 
AA.i.144f.) Visākha had been the treasurer, appointed by the three sons of 
Jayasena, in charge of the provisions given by them for the almsgiving held in 
honour of Phussa Buddha and his monks.</p>
<p>Visākha is mentioned (SA.iii.223) as one of the seven lay 
disciples in the time of the Buddha who had each five hundred followers.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Visākha. </b>Called Pañcāliputta. He was son of a 
provincial governor (mandalikarājā) of Magadha, and was called Pañcāliputta 
because his mother was the daughter of the Pañcāla king. (AA.ii.511 calls him 
the son of Pañcālibrāhmanī). He succeeded his father, and, hearing one day that 
the Buddha had arrived near his village, he visited him, heard him preach and 
joined the Order. He then accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthi, where he became an 
arahant. Later, out of compassion, he visited his relations.</p>
<p>One day he was asked how many qualities were necessary to 
a man in order that he should be considered a skilful preacher of the Dhamma. 
Visākha’s answer is included in the Theragāthā (Thag. vs. 209 10; ThagA.i.331f).</p>
<p>Fourteen kappas ago he was a poor householder, and one 
day, while searching in the forest for fruit, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and 
offered him a vallī fruit. He is evidently to be identified with 
Valliphaladāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.296).</p>
<p>Visākha was evidently a clever and arresting preacher, and 
the books mention that the Buddha heard him preach and praised him. S.ii.280; 
A.ii.51.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Visākha Thera.</b> He was a rich householder of 
Pātaliputta who, hearing that there were many shrines in Ceylon, made over his 
property to his family and left home with one single coin wrapt in the hem of 
his garment. He had to spend one month at the port waiting for a ship, and, 
during that time, made one thousand by his skill in trade. Arrived at the 
Mahāvihāra, he asked to be ordained, and when, at the time of his ordination, 
the money was discovered, he distributed it among those who were present. After 
five years he set out travelling, and, with the help of a devatā, found his way 
to Cittalapabbata vihāra, where he stayed for four months. As he was about to 
leave, the devatā of the jambu tree which stood at the head of his cankamana 
appeared before him weeping, and explained that while the Thera was there the 
nonhumans lived in peace, but that when he had gone they would start quarrelling 
and talking loudly. Several times he tried to leave but was thus prevented, 
until, at last, he became an arahant and died there. Vsm.i.312f; the story is 
referred to at AA.ii.865.</p>
