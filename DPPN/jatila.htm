<p><b>l. Jatila.</b>-A class of ascetics, so 
called on account of their matted hair (jatilā ti tāpasā, to hi jatādhāritāya 
idha jatilā ti vuttā) (UdA.74; see also 330). These ascetics are sometimes 
classed under isi (Culla Nid.149) and also under muni (Culla Nid.513).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Jatila.</b>-A governor of a province (Mahāratthiya) 
in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was the Bodhisatta. v.l. Jatika. J.i.37; 
Bu.xi.11.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Jatila (v.l. Jatilaka).</b>-A setthi of 
Magadha, one of the five setthis of Bimbisāra (DhA.i.385). His mother was a 
setthi’s daughter in Benares, who had illicit relations with a Vijjādhara, and 
when the child was born she placed it in a vessel which she handed to her slave, 
to be floated down the Ganges. Two women, while bathing, saw the vessel, 
discovered what it contained and each claimed the child. The dispute was settled 
by the king and the child was given to the woman who happened to be a disciple 
of Mahā Kaccāna. The child was called Jatila because the first time he was 
bathed after birth his hair became matted. When able to walk, he was given to 
Mahā Kaccāna to be ordained, but the thera took him to Takkasilā and handed him 
over to one of his supporters, a merchant, who adopted him as his son. Years 
passed, and one day the merchant, having to go on a journey, made a list of the 
goods which he had accumulated in his house during twelve years and asked Jatila 
to sell them if he could find buyers. Such was the lad’s fortune that in one day 
they were all disposed of. The merchant, realising the young man’s destiny, gave 
him his daughter in marriage and provided him with a house. As Jatila stepped 
into the house, the earth behind it was rent asunder and a mountain of gold, 
eighty cubits in height, appeared for his use. Thereupon the king made him a 
Treasurer. Later, wishing to retire from the world, Jatila sent out messengers 
to discover if there were others as rich as he, in case the king should raise 
objections to his going away. When news was brought back of Mendaka and Jotika, 
he knew there would be no opposition and obtained the king’s permission. He had 
three sons, but, having tested them, came to know that only the youngest had the 
necessary good fortune to enjoy his vast wealth. Jatila thereupon handed over to 
him his wealth and entered the Order, becoming an arahant within a few days. 
Some time afterwards the Buddha, with Jatila and other monks, was entertained 
for a fortnight by Jatila’s sons, and in answer to the monks' questions Jatila 
declared that he felt no desire to re-enter household life. The monks found this 
hard to believe till assured by the Buddha that it was so.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jatila 
was a goldsmith. One day, an arahant, seeking for gold wherewith to complete the 
shrine erected over the Buddha’s remains, came to the goldsmith’s house; the 
latter, having just quarrelled with his wife, was in a surly mood and said to 
the arahant, “Throw your teacher into the water and get away.” His wife told him 
how wicked were his words, and he, realising his fault, asked pardon of the 
arahant and made valuable offerings at the Buddha’s shrine, by way of amends. Of 
his three sons whom he asked, in turn, to help him with the preparations, only 
the youngest consented to go with him. Therefore it was that in seven successive 
states Jatila was thrown into the water on the day of his birth and only his 
youngest son could enjoy his wealth (DhA.iv.214ff; PsA.502f).</p>
<p>Jatila’s possession of a golden mountain 
is given as an example of puññiddhi, he being one of the five persons of great 
merit. Vsm.383; BuA.24.</p>
