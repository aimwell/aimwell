  <h2>Gomaya, or Gomayapind카 Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Jetavana. A monk asks the 
Buddha whether there is any body or anything at all that is permanent and 
stable. The Buddha takes a pellet of cow dung in his hand and tells him that the 
personality in any one span of life (attabh훮va) even as small as that pellet is 
unstable. The Buddha then tells the monk of the great luxuries he had enjoyed as 
king (Mah훮-Sudassana) of Kus훮vati, and of how they all perished (S.iii.143f).</p>
<p>This sutta was preached by Mahinda at 
the Nandana grove, on the sixth day after his arrival in Ceylon. Mhv.xv.197.</p>
