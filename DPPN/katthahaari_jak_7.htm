<p>Brahmadatta, king of Benares, while 
wandering about in a grove, seeking for fruits and flowers, came upon a woman 
merrily singing as she gathered sticks. He became intimate with her, and the 
Bodhisatta was conceived then and there. The king gave the woman his signet 
ring, with instructions that if the child was a boy, he should be brought to the 
court with the ring. When the Bodhisatta grew up his playmates nicknamed him 
“No-father.” Feeling ashamed, he asked his mother about it and, on hearing the 
truth, insisted on being taken to the king. When confronted with the child, the 
king was too shy to acknowledge his parentage, and the mother, having no 
witness, threw the child into the air with the prayer that he should remain 
there if her words were true. The boy, sitting cross-legged in the air, 
requested the king to adopt him, which request was accepted, his mother being 
made queen consort. On his father’s death he became king under the name of 
Katthavāhana.</p>
<p>The story was told to 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> on his 
refusal to recognize the claim to the throne of <a href="viduudabha.htm" title="vy/viduudabha.htm">Vidūdabha</a>, his son by Vāsabha-Khattiyā (J.i.133ff; iv.148; DhA.i.349).  </p>
<p>Perhaps the story has some 
connection with that of Dusyanta and Sakuntalā, as given in the Mahābhārata and 
later amplified by Kālidāsa in his drama.</p>
