  <h2>Mahā Thūpa </h2>

<p>The great Thūpa in Anurādhapura, built by Dutthagāmani. 
The site on which it was erected was consecrated by the visit of all the four 
Buddhas of this kappa and was at the upper end of the Kakudhavāpi. It was one of 
the spots at which Mahinda scattered campaka flowers by way of homage, and the 
earth trembled. When Mahinda informed Devānampiyatissa of the great sanctity of 
the spot and of its suitability for a Thūpa, Tissa immediately wished to build 
the Thūpa himself, but Mahinda bade him desist, telling him that the work would 
be carried out in the future by Dutthagāmani. Tissa recorded this prophecy on a 
pillar of stone (Mhv.xv.51ff., 167ff). When Dutthagāmani had won his victory 
over the Damilas and had brought peace to the country, he saw the prophecy 
inscribed on the stone pillar, but was unwilling to start the work as the people 
were too crippled with regard to money to be able to support such an immense 
undertaking. But the devas read his thoughts and provided him with all the 
necessaries for the building of the Thūpa. Prepared bricks were found on the 
banks of the Gambhīranadī, copper near Tambapittha, silver in the 
Ambatthakolalena, pearls at Uruvelā, and gems in a cave near Pelivāpigāma. The 
building was started on the full moon day of Visākha. The foundation stone was 
laid on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month of Asālha. Great 
celebrations marked the event, arrangements for which were in the hands of the 
ministers Visākha and Sirideva. Monks were present not only from all over Ceylon 
but from many other places: eighty thousand under Indagutta from Rājagaha, 
twelve thousand under Dhammasena from Isipatana, sixty thousand under Piyadassī 
from Jetavanārāma, eighteen thousand under Mahā Buddharakkhita from Mahāvana in 
Vesāli, thirty thousand under Mahā Dhammarakkhita from Ghositārāma in Kosambī, 
forty thousand under Mahā Sangharakkhita from Dakkhināgiri in Ujjeni, one 
hundred and sixty thousand under Mittinna Asokārāma in Pātaliputta, two hundred 
and eighty thousand under Uttinna from Kasmīra, four hundred and sixty thousand 
under Mahādeva from Pallabhogga, thirty thousand under Yonamahā Dhammarakkhita 
from Alasandā, sixty thousand under Uttara from Viñjhātavī, thirty thousand 
under Cittagutta from Bodhimanda vihāra, eighty thousand under Candagutta from 
Vanavāsa, and ninety six thousand under Suriyagutta from Kelāsa vihāra. Of 
arahants alone ninety six crores were present.</p>
<p>As the king stepped into the space left open for him, he 
expressed the desire that, if his worship were to have a happy result, theras 
bearing the names of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha, should take their 
places on the east, south, and west sides respectively, and a thera bearing the 
name of Ānanda on the north side, each thera to be surrounded by a group bearing 
the same name. The king’s wish was fulfilled; the theras in question and their 
companions were called Mahā Buddharakkhita, Mahā Dhammarakkhita, Mahā 
Sangharakkhita and Mahānanda. As the king was about to mark the space to be 
covered by the cetiya, the Thera Siddhattha, looking into the future, told him 
to define only a moderate space for the Thūpa. This the king did; then, looking 
at the theras immediately around him, he inquired their names and rejoiced to 
find them so auspicious, they being Siddhattha, Mangala, Sumam, Paduma, Sīvalī, 
Candagutta, Suriyagutta, Indagutta, Sāgara, Mittasena, Jayasena, and Acala. He 
then laid the first foundation stone on the east side on sweet smelling clay 
prepared by Mittasena and sprinkled with water by Jayasena; Mahāsumana placed 
jasmine flowers on the stone. Immediately the earth trembled in wonder. The 
minister who helped the king to mark out the area of the cetiya was 
Suppatitthitabrahmā, son of Nandisena and Sumanadevī. At the end of the 
ceremony, Piyadassī preached to the assembled populace, and many attained to 
various fruits of the Path.</p>
<p>The Thūpa was like a water bubble in shape; its architect 
was Sirivaddha and his assistant Acala. Orders were given that no unpaid work 
should be done in the construction of the cetiya. Arahants caused the three 
terraces of flower offerings to the Thūpa (pupphādhānā) to sink nine times into 
the earth, in order, as they explained, to strengthen the foundations. The 
cetiya was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and for the ten flower terraces 
alone ten crores of bricks were used.</p>
<p>The Relic Chamber was of unparalleled magnificence, and 
consisted of four medavannapāsānā, each eighty cubits in length and in breadth 
and eight inches thick. These were brought from Uttarakura by two sāmaneras, 
Uttara and Sumana. In the Chamber were placed sculptural representations of the 
chief events connected with the Buddha’s life as well as pictures of several 
Jātakas, including the Vessantara. </p>
<p>For list see Mhv.xxx.71ff.; the MT (549ff.) contains a 
long disquisition to prove that there is no reason to doubt the account given of 
the contents of the Relic Chamber, for in its construction the power (iddhi) of 
the king, of devas, and of arahants came into play.</p>
<p>The work of the Relic Chamber was under the personal 
supervision of Indagutta Thera, of great iddhi power. When the Chamber was ready 
for the enshrining of the Relics, Sonuttara of Pūjā parivena was entrusted with 
the task of obtaining them. In a previous birth, as Nanduttara, he had vowed to 
have the power of doing this, and now was his opportunity. He went to Mañjerika 
Nāga bhavana, where the Relics, washed away from the Thūpa at Rāmagāma, were in 
the custody of the Nāga Mahākāla, and by a display of iddhi power obtained them 
from the Nāga against his desire. They represented one dona of the Buddha’s 
Relics, and the Buddha had predicted that they would ultimately be placed in the 
Mahā Thūpa. These Relics were enshrined on the fifteenth uposatha day in the 
light half of the month of Āsālha, under the constellation of Uttarāsālha. Many 
devas and brahmas and nāgas were present as on the day of the Buddha’s 
Enlightenment, and ninety six crores of arahants attended the ceremony. As the 
king, after passing three times round the cetiya, ascended it on the east side, 
and was about to descend into the Relic Chamber, bearing on his head the Casket 
of Relics, the casket opened and the Relics rose out of it, and taking on the 
form of the Buddha, performed the Twin Miracle, as at the foot of the Gandamba. 
When the Relics were placed on the couch prepared for them they assumed, as the 
king had desired, the form of the Buddha as he lay on his death bed. For a whole 
week the celebrations lasted, and during this period the king offered to the 
Relics the dominion of Ceylon, and Indagutta decreed that the people of Ceylon, 
wherever they might be, should be able immediately to visit the Thūpa should 
they desire to do so. At the end of the seven days, the two sāmaneras, Uttara 
and Sumana, closed the Chamber with the medavannapāsānā set apart for the 
purpose, while arahants pronounced that flowers offered in the Relic Chamber 
should not wither, nor scents dry up; the lamps should not be extinguished nor 
anything whatever perish. </p>
<p>The building of the Māha Thūpa is described in Mhv. chaps 
xxviii-xxx.; MT. 514 83; Dpv.xix.1ff.; also Thūpavamsa 
(pp. 66ff.).</p>
<p>The treasures enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa were worth 
twenty crores, the rest cost one thousand crores (Mhv.xxxii.18).</p>
<p>Before the parasol of the Mahā Thūpa and the plaster work 
could be completed, Dutthagāmani fell ill, and his brother, Saddhātissa, 
summoned from Dīghavāpi, contrived with great skill to make the Thūpa look 
complete, that the king might see it before he died. After the king’s obsequies 
had been performed, in a place within sight of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.58), 
Saddhātissa finished the work yet remaining and established celebrations to be 
performed three times daily at the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.60; Mhv.xxxiii.5). 
Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Mahā Thūpa and the Thūpārāma and 
built three stone terraces at the cost of three hundred thousand 
(Mhv.xxxiii.22f). Khallātanāga made the courtyard of sand, surrounded by a wall 
(Mhv.xxxiii.31). Bhātika constructed two vedikā round the courtyard 
(Mhv.xxxiv.39). It is said (MT. 553f) that Bhātika was taken by the arahants 
into the Relic Chamber, and he held great celebrations in its honour (see 
Bhātikābhaya). Mahādāthika Mahānāga converted the sand courtyard into a wide 
court laid out with kiñcakkha stones on plaster (Mhv.xxxiv.69), while 
Ānanda gāmani erected a parasol over the cetiya (Mhv.xxxv.2) and Ilanāga made the 
Lambakannas construct a roadway leading up to the Mahā, Thūpa (Mhv.xxxiv.17). 
Sirināga had the whole Thūpa gilded and crowned with a new parasol 
(Mhv.xxxvi.24), this work being undertaken again later by Sanghatissa 
(Mhv.xxxvi.65), while Sanghabodhi made rain to pour down by means of prostrating 
himself in the courtyard (Mhv.xxxvi.75). Jetthatissa offered two precious gems 
to the Thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.126), while Aggabodhi I. placed on the Thūpa a golden 
umbrella (Cv.xlii.32), From this time onward the country passed through very 
troublous times and the Mahā Thūpa was neglected. But it was restored by 
Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxxiv.10; lxxvi.106f; lxxviii.97) and again by 
Kittinissanka (Cv.lxxx.20); it was later pillaged by Māgha (Cv.lxxx.68), and 
remained neglected till the time of Parakkamabāhu II., who started the work of 
reconstruction (Cv.lxxxvii.66), which was completed by his son Vijayabāhu IV. 
Cv.lxxxviii.83; after this, the cetiya once more fell into disrepair and has so 
continued till recently, when an attempt is being made to rebuild it.</p>
<p>The Mahā Thūpa has been a place of pilgrimage for 
Buddhists from the time of its building down to the present day, even when the 
place was deserted and its courtyards overgrown with creepers (e.g., Vibhā.446). 
There seems to have been a hall for pilgrims to the west of the cetiya 
(Vibhā.446). When the Buddha’s sāsana disappears, all the Relics of the Buddha 
deposited in various cetiyas all over Ceylon will gather together at the 
Mahācetiya, and from there will go to the Rajāyatana cetiya in Nāgadīpa, thence 
to the, Mahābodhipallanka, where all the Relics, assembled from everywhere, will 
take the form of the Buddha seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Then they will 
be consumed by self generated flames (Vibhā.433).</p>
<p>The Mahā Thūpa is known by other names: Mahācetiya, 
Ratanavāluka (Cv.lxxvi.106), Ratanavāli (Cv.lxxx.68), Sonnamāli (Mhv.xxvii.3) (Hemamāli), 
and Hemavāluka (Cv.li.82).</p>
