  <h2>Mahāmālunkyā Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On the five bonds that chain uninstructed men to the lower 
life: delusion as to personality, doubt, attachment to rites, lusts of the 
flesh, and malevolence. The path to the destruction of these bonds is the 
cultivation of the jhānas (M.i.432<span lang="en-us">-7).</p>
<p>The Sutta is so called because it was preached in 
contradiction of a wrong answer given by Mālunkyāputta to a question of the 
Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his error, and Ānanda requested the Buddha to 
give the correct answer.</p>
<p>This is one of the suttas which teach samatha-vipassanā. 
MA.ii.572.</p>
