dog in the same house, because be had envied a bitch which lived there. When the 
dog grew up, it used to accompany the herdsman on a visit to a Pacceka Buddha, 
who had meals in his house. Sometimes, when the herdsman was unable to go 
himself, be would send the dog to summon the Pacceka Buddha. The road led 
through a forest and the dog would bark aloud to frighten away the wild beasts.
