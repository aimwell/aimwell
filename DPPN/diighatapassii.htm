</ul>
<p>A Nigantha, follower of Nātaputta. He 
once visited the Buddha at Nālandā, and there followed a discussion on actions 
and their efficiency. Dīghatapassī reported this discussion to Nātaputta and 
Upāli, who was listening, went, against the advice of Dīghatapassī, to the 
Buddha and challenged him to a discussion, at the end of which Upāli was 
converted (M.i.371ff). </p>
<p>The Commentary (MA.ii.594) says that 
Dīghatapassī was long-limbed, hence his name.</p>
