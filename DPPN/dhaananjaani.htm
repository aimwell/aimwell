<p>1. Dhānañjāni (v.l. Dhānañjāni).-A 
brahmin of Tandulapāladvāra in Rājagaha. He was a minister of the king and 
oppressed the people in order to get rich. Sāriputta, hearing of his fall from 
the ways of earnestness — after the death of his first pious wife and his 
marriage to another — visited Dhānañjāni and pointed out to him that if he 
departed from equity and righteousness he could not hope to be excused on the 
plea that his fall was due to force of circumstances. Dhānañjāni profited by the 
discourse, and later, when he was ill, he sent word to Sāriputta, told him of 
his dire illness, and expressed his wish to be born in one of the Brahma-worlds. 
Sāriputta taught how union with Brahmā could be attained. Soon after, Dhānañjāni 
died, and the Buddha said that he was born in one of the lower Brahma-worlds. 
M.ii.184ff.</p>
<p>2. Dhānañjāni.-A brahminee, probably of 
Rājagaha. She was married to a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja-gotta. One day, while 
serving her husband’s dinner, she sang the praises of the Buddha, the Dhamma and 
the Order. The brahmin, very annoyed, threatens to go to the Buddha and abuse 
him. His wife encourages him to go. He goes, has a discussion with the Buddha, 
and is converted. Later, he joins the Order and, in due course, becomes an 
arahant (S.i.159f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.175ff) the 
brahminee was a sotāpanna and that she would constantly sing the praises of the 
Buddha while engaged in her duties and that the brahmin closed his ears to it. 
One day he invited a large number of his friends to a banquet, and, on the eve 
of the great day, asked her to promise not to offend his brahmin friends by her 
udāna. She refused to give any such promise, even when he threatened to cut her 
with a dagger. She declared herself ready to suffer, and sang five hundred 
verses on her theme. The brahmin surrendered. While waiting on the guests, her 
impulse became too great for her, and, laying down bowl and spoon, she started 
repeating her song of praise. The scandalised guests hurried away, spitting out 
the food, defiled by the presence of a heretic, and her husband scolded her for 
the spoiled feast. She may be the woman who was responsible for the visit of 
Sangārava (q.v.) to the Buddha. The latter is, however, stated to have lived in 
Candalakappa (M.ii.209).</p>
<p>3. Dhānañjāni.-Buddhaghosa says 
(SA.i.175) that this was the name of a brahmin clan of great pride of birth, 
claiming descent from the head of Brahma, whereas the other brahmins were born 
from his mouth.</p>
<p>1. Dānañjāni Sutta.-Records the story of 
Dhānañjāni of Tandulapāladvāra (q.v.). S.ii.184ff.</p>
<p>2. Dhānañjāni Sutta.-Records the story 
of how Bhāradvāja, husband of the brahminee Dhānañjāni (q.v.), became an 
arahant. S.i.159ff.</p>
