<p>A monastery in Ceylon. A 
  monk of the monastery, who once went to worship at the Mahā Thūpa, saw there 
  some devatās also worshipping; they had been born in heaven as a result of 
  having participated in the building of the thūpa (Mhv.xxx.46f).  </p>
<p>In the time of Dutthagāmanī, the chief incumbent of the vihāra was Mahānāga. MT. 606.</p>
