<p>A monastery in Ceylon. Jetthatissa III. 
gave the village of AmbilÄpika for the supply of food to the monks of 
Kassapagiri (Cv.xliv.98), and Kassapa III. showed this monastery his special 
favour (Cv.xlviii.24).</p>
<p>The monastery probably formed part of 
what â€” in an inscription of Mahinda IV. found at Vessagiris – is called the â€œIsuramenu-Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri-VihÄra.â€ 
It would appear that Kassapa I. founded a great monastic establishment out of 
the Vessagiri and Issarasamana VihÄras and that this enlarged monastery was 
named after his two daughters Bodhi and UppalavannÄ and also after Kassapa 
himself. This establishment was evidently referred to briefly as Kassapagiri. (Ep. 
Zey.i.31ff; i.216; and Cv.Trs.i.43, n.7).</p>
<p>The name Kacchapa giri (q.v.) found in 
the MahÄvamsa Tika (p.652; see also 407, which has Kassapagiri) is apparently a 
wrong reading for Kassapagiri, in which case the identification is important, 
for here we have â€œIssarasamanasankhÄte KacchapagirivihÄre.â€ See also 
KassapavihÄra.</p>
