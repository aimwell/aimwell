<p>The celebrated almsgiving which 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a>, under the guidance and inspiration of
<a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a>, held, in order to outdo 
his citizens in their generosity to the Buddha and the Order. The almsgiving was 
attended with unparalleled splendour, khattiya maidens fanning monks while 
elephants held white parasols over them and golden boats filled with perfumes 
and flowers were placed in the gay pavilion where the monks were fed. </p>
<p>Four gifts of priceless value were given 
to the Buddha, a white parasol, a couch whereon to rest, a stand and a 
footstool. </p>
<p>These gifts were never after equalled by 
those of anyone else, each Buddha receiving these gifts only once in his 
lifetime (DA.ii.653-4; DhA.iii.183-6).</p>
<p>The <a href="aaditta_jat_424.htm" title="aa/aaditta_jat_424.htm">Aditta</a>, the 
<a href="dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm" title="d/dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm">Dasabrāhmana</a> and the 
<a href="sivi_jat_499.htm" title="s/sivi_jat_499.htm">Sivi</a> Jātakas were all preached in reference to the Asadisadāna.</p>
