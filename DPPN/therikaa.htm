<p>An arahant Therī. She was born in a 
family of Vesāli and was so called because of her sturdy build. She married and 
became a devoted wife, accepting the Buddha’s teaching, after hearing him preach 
at Vesāli. Later she heard Pajāpatī Gotamī and wished to leave the world, but 
her husband refused his permission. One day, while cooking, she developed the 
thought of impermanence and became an Anāgāmī. When her husband realised this, 
he took her to Pajāpatī, who ordained her. </p>
<p>In the past she had entertained 
Konāgamana Buddha and built for him an arbour with draped ceiling and sanded 
floor. </p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was a 
nun. Thig.1; ThigA., p.5.</p>
