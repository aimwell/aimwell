<p>An Elder. One night, while staying with 
his friend Utta (Datta?) in a monastery in Kosala, he awoke and, lighting a 
fire, started talking to him. Their conversation turned on the war which 
Pasenadi was waging against Ajātasattu. Tissa, maintaining that Pasenadi was 
ignorant of the arts of war, proceeded to describe in detail what Pasenadi 
should do if he wished for victory. Some courtiers, overhearing the 
conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the 
battle and captured Ajātasattu alive. When the matter was reported to the 
Buddha, he related the Vaddhaki-sūkara Jātaka (q.v.) to show that in the past, 
too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f). The Tacchasūkara 
Jātaka (J.iv.343, 354) was also related in this connection.</p>
