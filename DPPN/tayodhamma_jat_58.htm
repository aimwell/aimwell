<p>Once Devadatta was born as king of the 
monkeys, and the Bodhisatta was his son. The monkey-king had the habit of 
gelding with his teeth all his male offspring, lest they should one day 
supersede him; but the Bodhisatta’s mother left the herd before the child was 
born and brought him up elsewhere. When he grew up he came to see the 
monkey-king, and on the latter’s trying to kill him by crushing him in a false 
embrace, the Bodhisatta showed greater strength than his sire. Then Devadatta 
asked him to fetch lotuses from a neighbouring lake, which was inhabited by an 
ogre, saying that he wished to crown his son as king. The Bodhisatta guessed the 
presence of the ogre and plucked the flowers by leaping several times from one 
bank to the other, grasping them on his way. The ogre seeing this expressed his 
admiration, saying that those who combine the three qualities of dexterity, 
valour, and resource can never be vanquished. When the monkey-king saw his son 
returning with the ogre, who was carrying the flowers, he died of a broken 
heart. The story was related in reference to hunting. J.i.280-3.</p>
