<p>The young son of wealthy parents of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. </p>
<p>Having heard the Buddha preach at <a href="veluvana.htm" title="vy/veluvana.htm">Veluvana</a>, he wished to join the 
Order; but could only obtain his parents' consent by starving for seven days. He 
then went with the Buddha to <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>. On the festival day his parents made 
great lamentation and a slave girl offered to entice him back. She rode in a 
palanquin to <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> and took up residence in a street whither the Elder came 
for alms. She gradually made his acquaintance, and then, feigning illness, 
enticed him into her apartments. Then, having violated his chastity, she took 
him back to Rājagaha (J.i.156f).</p>
<p>The Buddha, hearing of this, preached the
<a href="vaatamiga_jat_014.htm" title="va/vaatamiga_jat_014.htm">Vātamiga Jātaka</a>, in which story Tissa is identified with the antelope. He is 
also referred to as Cullapindapātiya (J.i.159).</p>
