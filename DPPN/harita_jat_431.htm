  <h2>Hārita Jātaka (No. 431)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was born in a wealthy brahmin family and 
was called Harittaca because of his golden colour. When his father died, he left 
the world and became an ascetic, with great supernatural powers. He went to 
Benares, and was invited by the king to live in the royal park. He accepted the 
invitation, and lived there for twelve years. The king was then called away to 
quell a frontier rebellion, and instructed the queen to look after the ascetic. 
One day, as the Bodhisatta came in late for his meal, the queen rose hastily and 
her robe of fine cloth fell from her. Harittaca was filled with lust, and, 
taking her hand and drawing a curtain round them, he lay with her. This then 
became a daily occurrence and the scandal spread abroad. The ministers wrote to 
the king, who, however, refused to believe them. When he returned he questioned 
the queen, who confessed her wrongdoing, but even then the king refused to 
believe it till Harittaca (or Hārita as he is also called) acknowledged his 
guilt. The king was full of admiration for his truthfulness and forgave him, but 
Harittaca, after preaching to the king on the misery of sinful desire, once more 
developed his mystic powers, took leave of the king, and returned to the 
Himālaya.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who had grown 
discontented because of a beautiful woman. J.iii.496-501.</p>
