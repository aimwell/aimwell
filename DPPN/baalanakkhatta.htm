<p>A festival lasting for seven days, during which people 
smeared their bodies with ashes and cow dung and went about talking coarsely. 
They respected no one, and when they visited at a house where their conversation 
was not appreciated, they received one penny to go away. Once when the festival 
was being held in Sāvatthi, the Buddha’s followers requested him not to leave 
the monastery, and provided him and the monks with all requisites so that they 
did not have to go out. DhA.i.256 f.</p>
