<p>1. Kālāma.-See Alāra-Kālāma.</p>
<p>2. Kālāma.-The name, probably, of a 
gotta or family. Mention is made of a nigama belonging to them in Kosala, which 
was called Kesaputta. The sermon preached by the Buddha on his visit to 
Kesaputta is justly famous (A.i.188ff). The Kālāmas were Khattiyas (AA.i.418). 
Among members of this family specially mentioned by name are Bharandu-Kālāma, 
who was once a co-disciple of the Bodhisatta, and Alāra-Kālāma, the teacher of 
Gotama before his Enlightenment.</p>
