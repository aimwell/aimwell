<h4>1. Pālita (Pālika)</h4>
<p>Nephew of Cakkhupāla. When Cullapāla, brother of 
Cakkhupāla, heard of the latter’s blindness, he sent Pālita to fetch him, and, 
in order to protect him from danger on the way, had him ordained before he set 
forth. While returning with Cakkhupāla, Pālita heard the song of a woman 
collecting firewood, and, making some excuse, left Cakkhupāla and had intimacy 
with her. When Cakkhupāla heard what had happened, he refused to go any farther 
with him. ThagA.i.197f.</p>
