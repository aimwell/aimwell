<p><b>1. Sumedha.</b> The Bodhisatta in the time of 
<a href="diipankara.htm" title="d/diipankara.htm">Dīpankara 
Buddha</a>. He was a very rich brahmin of Amaravatī, and, having left the world, 
became an ascetic of great power in the Himālaya. While on a visit to 
Rammma-nagara, he saw people decorating the road for Dīpankara Buddha, and 
undertook to do one portion of the road himself. The Buddha arrived before his 
work was finished, and Sumedha lay down on a rut for the Buddha to walk over 
him. He resolved that he, too, would become a Buddha, and Dīpankara, looking 
into the future, saw that his wish would come true. This was the beginning of 
Gotama Buddha’s qualification for Enlightenment. J.i.2ff.; DhA.i.68; Bu.ii.5ff.; 
SNA.i.49; in Chinese Records he is called Megha. The Dvy. (p.247) calls him 
Sumati.</p>
