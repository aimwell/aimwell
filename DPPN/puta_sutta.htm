<p>Tālaputa visits the Buddha and asks him if there be any 
truth in the tradition that stage actors are born, after death, among the 
Pahāsadevā. The Buddha refuses at first to answer the question, but, on being 
pressed, he says that the truth is that actors are born in the Pahāsa niraya. 
Tālaputa thereupon starts to weep to think that he should have been so long 
deceived. He enters the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant. S.iv.306f.</p>
