  <h2>Tapodārāma</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A grove near lake Tapodā (q.v.). In the 
grove was a monastery where the Buddha seems to have stayed on several 
occasions. It is said (D.ii.116) that on one such occasion the Buddha gave 
Ānanda the chance of asking him to live for a whole kappa, but Ānanda  failed to 
make use of it.</p>
<p>Near the Tapodārāma was the 
Tapodakandārā. They were both far from Rājagaha, and monks would come from afar 
late at night and, in order to test Dabba Mallaputta’s powers, ask him to 
provide lodgings for them (Vin.ii.76; iii.159).</p>
