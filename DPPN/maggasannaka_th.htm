<p>An arahant. In the time of 
  Padumuttara Buddha he was a devaputta in Himavā, and, coming across some monks 
  who had lost their way in the forest, he entertained them and set them on the 
  right road. One hundred and five kappas ago he was king twelve times under the 
  name of Sacakkhu (Ap.i.152f). He is probably identical with Ekadhammasavaniya. 
  ThagA.i.151f.</p>
