</ul>
<p>Preached at Bhaddiya to the daughters of 
Uggaha Mendakanattā just before their marriage. A wife should rise betimes 
before her husband, and sleep after him; she should respect his wishes, give him 
pleasure and be of sweet speech. His parents and elders and all those whom he 
holds in esteem, should she reverence and honour; she should be skilful in all 
the duties of the household; she should look after the servants in the house and 
supervise their duties, provide them with all necessaries and be kind and 
helpful to them; she should safeguard her husband’s interests and look after his 
wealth; she should be of virtuous conduct in every way. A.iii.36ff.</p>
