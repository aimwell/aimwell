<p>1. Dāthāsiva.-A thera held in high 
esteem by Aggabodhi I (Cv.xlii.22). Geiger (Cv.Trs.i.67, n.8) thinks he probably 
held some sort of position in the king’s court, corresponding to that of a 
purohita.</p>
<p>2. Dāthāsiva.-Minister of Jetthatissa 
III. He was captured by the forces of Aggabodhi III. at Māyetti, but later 
regained his freedom and was sent by Jetthatissa to India to cut off Aggabodhi’s 
rearward communications. When Jetthatissa committed suicide and Aggabodhi was 
once more king, Dāthāsiva returned to Ceylon, defeated Aggabodhi and became king 
as Dāthopatissa. But his reign was insecure and he was constantly having to 
flee. He was very rapacious and plundered the temples. Later, to make amends, he 
built the Sākavatthu-vihāra and restored the Thūpārāma. In the end he fled to 
India from Kassapa II., but returned later and fought a battle in which he was 
killed (Cv.xliv.128ff). He had a nephew, Hatthadātha (Cv.xliv.155), who became 
known as Bhāgineyya-Dāthopatissa. The prince Bodhi and the princess Lokitā were 
descendants of Dāthopatissa (Cv.lvii.40).</p>
<p>3. Dāthāsiva. A thera, resident of 
Nāgasālā; he was very learned and held in great esteem by Aggabodhi IV 
(Cv.xlvi.6).</p>
<p>4. Dāthāsiva.-Uparājā of Aggabodhi IV. 
He was captured and imprisoned by Potthakuttha. Cv.xlvi.40.</p>
<p>5. Dāthāsiva.-An ādipāda, ruler of 
Rohana. His son was Mahinda, who quarrelled with him and, with the king’s help, 
drove him to India and took possession of Rohana. Cv.xlix.10.</p>
