<p><b>1. Isidatta.</b>-A thera. He was the 
son of a caravan guide at Vaddhagāma (v.l. Velugāma) in Avanti. By 
correspondence he became the unseen friend of <a href="citta.htm" title="c/citta.htm">Citta-gahapati</a> of Macchikāsanda. 
The latter once sent him a letter regarding the excellences of the Buddha, and 
Isidatta, being pleased with the account given of the Buddha’s religion, entered 
the Order under <a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā-Kaccāna</a> and in due 
course became an arahant. Later, with Mahā-Kaccāna’s leave, he visited the 
Buddha in the Majjhimadesa and was warmly received by him (ThagA.i.238). A verse 
uttered by Isidatta, in response to the Buddha’s enquiry regarding his welfare, 
is recorded in the Therāgāthā (v.120).</p>
<p>Isidatta had been a householder in the 
time of Vipassī Buddha and once, having seen the Buddha walking along the street 
and being pleased with his demeanour, he gave him an āmoda-fruit (ThagA. loc. 
cit.). He is, probably, identical with Amodapaliya of the Apadāna (ii.447).</p>
<p>According to the Samyutta Nikāya 
(iv.283-8, also AA.i.210), Isidatta was once staying with a number of senior 
monks at Macchikāsanda in the Ambātaka grove. Citta-gahapati invited the monks 
to a meal. On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha’s 
teaching on the diversity of the elements. The chief Elder, being unable to 
answer, remained silent. Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, 
obtained the chief Elder’s permission, and answered the question to the 
satisfaction of Citta. Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, 
such as the infinity of the world, etc. At the end of the discourse, Citta 
discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other 
than his unseen friend, Isidatta. Delighted with the discovery, he invited 
Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchikāsanda, promising to provide him with all 
requisites. But that same day Isidatta left Macchikāsanda and never returned. 
Because, says Buddhaghosa (AA.i.210), he did not wish to stay after having been 
recognised.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Isidatta.</b>-An equerry or 
chamberlain (thapati) of Pasenadi, King of Kosala. Isidatta is always mentioned 
with Purāna. Their duty was to look after the ladies of the king’s harem when 
these went riding the elephant into the park. This often brought them into close 
contact with the ladies, and they confessed to the Buddha that it was difficult 
not to have evil thoughts regarding them.</p>
<p>Isidatta and Purāna were once at Sādhuka' 
on some business (their own property, according to Buddhaghosa, SA.i.215). They 
heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and 
they waited for an opportunity to talk to him. When the opportunity came they 
followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them 
and how sad when he was away on tour. The Buddha preaches to them the glory of 
the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy. He speaks very 
appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates 
them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods 
with holy men, a rare quality (S.v.348-52; Netti. 134f).</p>
<p>According to the Samyutta Commentary 
(i.215), Isidatta was a Sakadāgāmī and Purāna a Sotāpanna.</p>
<p>In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123f), 
Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and 
Purāna show for the Buddha and his teachings. “They are my carriage-builders,” 
says the king, “and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their 
honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord.”</p>
<p>Once the king spent the night in a 
cramped little house. Isidatta and Purāna, who were with him, having spent the 
best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their 
heads in the direction in which they thought the Buddha to be, and their feet 
towards the king!</p>
<p>Isidatta was the uncle of the 
woman-disciple Migasālā, whose father was Purāna.</p>
<p>Purāna is described as a brahmacāri, but 
not Isidatta, yet, after death, they were both born in Tusita. Migasālā asks 
Ānanda how it was that people of different characters could have the same 
rebirth. A.iii.348f.; v.138f., 143f. From MA.ii.756, it would appear as if 
Isidatta was the brahmacāri. The word cannot here mean “celibate,” for Purāna 
must have had a wife because Migasālā calls him her father (pitā).</p>
<p>Isidatta is mentioned by the Buddha 
among those who had the six qualities that brought realisation of immortality — 
unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan virtue, 
wisdom and liberation (A.iii.451).</p>
<p>The Anāgata Vamsa (v.58) says that when 
the future Buddha Metteyya leaves the household life, eighty-four thousand 
others, led by Isidatta and Purāna, will accompany him.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Isidatta.</b>-King of Soreyya. 
Anomadassī Buddha preached to him and to eighty thousand of his followers. They 
all became arahants. BuA.143-4.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Isidatta.</b>-One of the three 
leaders of the monks in Ceylon during the time that Brāhmanatissa-cora laid 
waste the land. The other two were Cūlasīva and Mahāsona. For the story 
connected with them see s.v. Mahāsona.</p>
