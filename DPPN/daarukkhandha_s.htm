<p><b>1. Dārukkhandha Sutta.</b>-Sāriputta, coming 
down Gijjhakuta, sees a log of wood, and tells the monks that a wise person 
could see all the elements in that log. A.iii.340.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dārukkhandha Sutta</b>.-The Buddha, while 
staying at Kosambī, sees a great log of wood floating down the river, and tells 
the monks that just as the log, if it does not ground on a bank, or sink in 
midstream, or stick on a shoal, or fall into human or non-human hands, or get 
caught in a whirlpool, or rot inwardly, will, without doubt, float down to the 
ocean; so will a monk, without doubt, float down to Nibbāna if he escapes the 
dangers on the way. The monks ask what the dangers are, and the Buddha explains 
them, on the analogy of the dangers besetting the log. At the end of the 
discourse, the cowherd Nanda, who had been listening, joined the Order. 
S.iv.179f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Dārukkhandha Sutta.</b>-The same as the 
above, except that the place mentioned is Kimbilā, and the explanations are 
given to Kimbila. S.iv.181.</p>
