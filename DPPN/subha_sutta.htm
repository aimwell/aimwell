<p><b>1. Subha Sutta. </b>Subha Todeyyaputta (q.v.) visits 
the Buddha at Sāvatthi and asks him various questions regarding the Dhamma, 
comparing it with the teachings of the brahmins regarding ultimate salvation. He 
admits that no one among the brahmins or the early sages had fully discerned and 
realized the qualities laid down by them for the attainment of merit and the 
achievement of right. He quotes Pokkharasāti as saying that those who, like 
Gotama, profess to transcend ordinary human beings and rise to the heights of 
Ariyan knowledge are idle boasters. The Buddha retorts that Pokkharasāti cannot 
even read the thoughts of his slave girl, Punnikā. The Buddha then convinces 
Subha that he has discovered the way to union with Brahmā, and, at his request, 
teaches him this way, as being the four Brahma-vihāras. Subha acknowledges 
himself the Buddha’s follower. M.ii.196-209.</p>

<p><b>2. Subha Sutta.</b> A conversation between Subha 
Todeyyaputta (q.v.) and Ānanda at Sāvatthi soon after the Buddha’s death. Subha 
asks Ānanda what were the bodies of doctrine which the Buddha was wont to 
praise, to which he incited others and in which he established them. Ānanda 
explains to him. The sutta is almost word for word identical with the 
Sāmaññāphala Sutta. D.i.204-10.</p>

<p><b>3. Subha Sutta. </b>According to Buddhaghosa, 
(MA.ii.962, 967) Subha Sutta is the real name for the Cūla-kammavibhanga Sutta 
(q.v.).</p>
