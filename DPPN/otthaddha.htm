<p>One of the Licchavis. His personal name 
(mūla-nāma) was Mahāli, but he was called Otthaddha because he had a hare-lip (addhotthatāya) 
(DA.i.310). </p>
<p>He went to visit the Buddha at the 
Kūtāgārasālā in Vesalī, at a time when the Buddha had given orders that no one 
should be allowed to see him; but through the intervention of the novice Sīha, 
Otthaddha was admitted to the Buddha’s presence with a large retinue of 
followers, all splendidly adorned in various ways, though it is stated that 
earlier in the day they had taken the uposatha-vows. The conversation that took 
place between Otthaddha and the Buddha is recorded in the Mahāli Sutta 
(D.i.150ff). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa calls Otthaddha a rājā.</p>
