<p><b>1. Ādiccabandhu</b>.-An often-used epithet 
of the Buddha (E.g., D.iii.197; Sn.v.1128; Thag. 26, 158, 417, etc.). The 
Vimanavatthu Commentary (p.116) says that Ādicca (the Sun) belonged to the 
Gotamagotta, as did also the Buddha, hence his epithet Ādiccabandhu; other 
explanations are given in the same context: the Buddha is born in the same ariyā 
jāti and is the descendant of the Sun (tam paticca tassa ariyāya jātiya jātattā), 
or the Sun is the Buddha’s kinsman because the Sun is the Buddha’s orasaputta 
(breast-born son) inasmuch as the Sun is the Buddha’s disciple. It is in this 
sense that in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.57) the Buddha speaks of the sun as “mama 
pajā,” which Buddhaghosa (SA.i.86) explains as meaning disciple and spiritual 
son.</p>
<p>Ādicca is described as tapatam mukham 
(chief of heat-producing things). MA.ii.783.</p>

<p><b>2. Ādiccabandhu</b>.-A Pacceka Buddha who 
was instrumental in enabling the author (son of the King of Benares) of the 
twentieth verse of the Khaggavisāna Sutta to become a Pacceka Buddha. 
Ādiccabandhu saw that the young prince, who had renounced the world and was 
living in his father’s park near the city, did not, on account of the visits of 
his parents and others, have sufficient peace of mind to develop his power of 
meditation.</p>
<p>He, therefore, visited the prince and 
persuaded him to go into the forest by showing him how real pabbajitas lived. 
The first two lines of the Sutta Nipāta verse (No. 54) were uttered by 
Ādiccabandhu. Sn.v.54; SnA.i.104-5; see also ApA.i.105, 152.</p>
