<a href="samiddhi.htm" title="sa/samiddhi.htm">Samiddhi</a> was once drying himself after bathing at  
<a href="tapodaa.htm" title="t/tapodaa.htm">Tapodā</a> 
in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, when a deity appeared before him and asked if he knew the
<a href="bhaddekaratta_s.htm" title="b/bhaddekaratta_s.htm">Bhaddekaratta Sutta</a>. On his replying in the negative, the deity asked him to 
learn it, and the next day Samiddhi sought the Buddha and learnt the verses of 
the sutta.  </p>
<p>Samiddhi and his colleagues then went to <a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> and urged him 
to explain the sutta in detail. This he did, for which they were very grateful. 
They repeated Kaccāna’s exposition to the Buddha, who greatly approved of it.
