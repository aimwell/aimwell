  <h2>Kimsīla Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached by the Buddha in reply to a 
question put by Sāriputta beginning with the word kimsīla. Sāriputta visited the 
Buddha, taking with him a young man, son of a friend of his father. The youth 
had joined the Order under Sāriputta renouncing his immense wealth, but he could 
gain no attainment. Sāriputta desired him to hear an exposition by the Buddha, 
hence his question (SnA.i.331).</p>
<p>One who aspires to the highest good 
should not be envious, obstinate, or careless, but diligent in his training, 
cultivating self-restraint and chastity, intent in the dhamma, making the dhamma 
his first and last concern (Sn.pp.56f).</p>
<p>This sutta is the ninth of the Culla 
Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta, and derives its name from the first word (kimsilo) in 
Sāriputta’s question.</p>
