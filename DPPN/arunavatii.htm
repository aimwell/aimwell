<p>1. Arunavatī.-The city and the country 
of King Arunavā, and the birthplace of Sikhī Buddha (Bu.xxi.15). It was from 
there that Sikhī and Abhibhū went to the Brahma-world to preach to Brahma and 
his attendants (S.i.155f). At that time Salalapupphiya Thera was a confectioner 
in Arunavatī (Ap.i.218). See also Arunapura.</p>
<p>2. Arunavatī.-A vihāra in the village of 
Itthakāvatī in Magadha. Sāriputta once lived there (PvA.67).</p>
<hr>
<p>Arunavatī Sutta.-Records the incident of 
the visit of Abhibhū to the Brahma-world (S.i.154f., etc.; see Abhibhū 1). 
Abhibhū chose as his theme action and energy, and the verses he uttered on that 
occasion, beginning “Ārabhatha, nikkhamatha, yuñjatha buddhasāsane” are often 
quoted.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.172-3) that 
Abhibhū chose this theme out of all the doctrines to be found in the Tipitaka 
because he knew that the subject would commend itself to all his hearers, human 
and non-human.</p>
<p>Milakkhatissa Thera of Ceylon, hearing a 
novice in Pācīnapabbata recite the Arunavatī Sutta, listened to the stanzas, and 
feeling that they had been preached to encourage zealous monks like himself, he 
exerted himself and became an anāgāmī. Soon afterwards he became an arahant 
(AA.i.21-2).</p>
<p>The sutta is said to have been preached 
by the Buddha on the fullmoon day of Jetthamāsa (AA.i.436).</p>
