<p><b>1. Sankha Jātaka (No. 442). </b>The Bodhisatta was once 
born in Molinī nagara (Benares) as a very rich brahmin, named Sankha. He spent 
six thousand daily on almsgiving. He had a ship built, equipped and prepared to 
sail for <a href="suvannabhuumi.htm" title="s/suvannabhuumi.htm">Suvannabhūmi</a>. A Pacceka, Buddha, seeing him with his divine eye, and 
foreseeing the danger in store for him, appeared before him on the way to the 
seaport. Sankha paid him all honour and presented him with his shoes and 
umbrella.</p>
<p>Sankha’s ship sprang a leak on the seventh day. Taking 
with him one companion, he dived overboard and swam in the direction of Molinī. 
He swam thus for seven days, till Manimekhalā, seeing his plight, came to his 
rescue and offered him food. But this he refused, as he was keeping the fast. 
The goddess told him that his purity in worshipping the Pacceka Buddha had been 
the cause of her coming to his aid and offered him a boon. He chose to be sent 
back to Molinī. The goddess provided him with a ship full of treasure, and he 
returned safely to Molinī with his attendant.</p>
<p>The story was related by way of thanks to a pious layman 
of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, who, having entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven 
days, 
presented shoes to the Buddha and to the members of his Order.</p>
<p><a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> is identified with Sankha’s attendant and 
<a href="uppalavanna.htm" title="u/uppalavanna.htm">Uppalavannā</a> with Manimekhalā (J.iv.15 22). The story is also called the 
Sankhabrāhmana Jātaka. E.g., ibid., 120.</p>

<p><b>2. Sankha Jātaka.</b> The Bodhisatta, named Sankha, was once born as a brahmin in 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> and had a son, 
<a href="susiima.htm" title="s/susiima.htm">Susīma</a>. When Susīma was about sixteen, he 
took leave of his father and went to Benares to study the Vedas. His teacher, 
who was a friend of his father’s, taught him all he knew, and then Susīma went 
to <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>, where lived some Pacceka. Buddhas. He entered the Order under 
them, attained arahantship, and died while yet young. Having heard no news of 
his son for some time, Sankha was alarmed and went to Benares in search of him. 
There, after enquiry, he heard of his son’s death as a Pacceka Buddha, and was 
shown the shrine erected in his memory. Sankha weeded the grass round the 
shrine, sprinkled sand, watered it, scattered wild flowers round it, and raised 
aloft his robe as banner over it. He then planted his parasol over the top and 
departed.</p>
<p>The Buddha related the story to the monks at 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, 
after his return from <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, to explain the 
unparalleled honours he had received during the journey. Because he had uprooted 
the grass round Susīma’s shrine, a road of eight leagues was prepared for him to 
journey comfortably; because he had spread sand, his route was also so spread; 
because he had scattered flowers, his route was covered with flowers; because he 
had sprinkled water, there was a shower in Vesāli on his arrival; because he had 
raised a banner and set up a parasol, the whole cakkavāla was gay with flags and 
parasols. DhA.iii.445f.; KhpA.198f. The story is not given in the 
<a href="jaatakatthakathaa.htm" title="j/jaatakatthakathaa.htm">Jātakatthakatha</a>.</p>
