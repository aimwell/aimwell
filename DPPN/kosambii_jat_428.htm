  <h2>Kosambī Jātaka (No.428)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The introductory story relates how the 
monks of Kosambī quarrelled and brought about great dissension among themselves 
because one of their number had left in a vessel the surplus water for rinsing 
the mouth. When the Buddha found that he could not induce the monks to live in 
harmony, he related to them the story of Dīghīti, king of Kosala, and when even 
that failed to produce the desired effect he uttered ten stanzas, standing 
poised in mid-air, and went away from Kosambī, leaving the monks to their fate.</p>
<p>The Kosambī Jātaka contains only a small 
portion of the story of Dīghīti, scarcely more than an allusion to it. The 
Dīghīti Kosala Jātaka (q.v.) contains further details, but even when taken 
together, these two do not make the story complete. The full story is related in 
the Vinaya Pitaka (Vin.i.342ff).</p>
