</ul>
<p>Pingala-Koccha visits the Buddha at 
Jetavana and questions him on famous teachers such as Pūrana Kassapa, Makkhali 
Gosāla and others. The Buddha tells him that the reward of the higher life is 
not to be found in presents, esteem, or good repute, nor in a life of virtue, 
rapt concentration, or mystic insight. Immortal deliverance only is the prize 
and the goal of the higher life. If a man needs the very best of wood, no other 
part of the tree will suffice.</p>
<p>Pingala-Koccha accepts the Buddha as his 
teacher. M.i.198ff</p>
