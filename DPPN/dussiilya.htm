<p><b>1. Dussīlya or Anāthapindika 
Sutta.</b>-Anāthapindika, grievously ill, sends for Sāriputta, who visits him with 
Ānanda. Sāriputta reminds Anāthapindika of his virtuous qualities, such as his 
loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, his freedom from immorality 
and the like, from wrong views, aims, etc. Immediately Anāthapindika’s pains 
vanish, he serves the two monks from his own cooking-pot, and they take their 
leave. Ānanda  reports the incident to the Buddha, who praises Sāriputta’s 
wisdom. S.v.380ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dussīlya or Anāthapindika Sutta.</b>-The 
same as the first, but here it is Ānanda who admonishes and reminds 
Anāthapindika that he possesses all the qualities of a sotāpanna. S.v.385f.</p>
