<ul>
  <li>
<h2>Nanda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally known as <b>Nanda Vaccha</b>.  </p>
<p>Mentioned in a list of 
well known leaders of the <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ajivakas</a>. They were declared by 
<a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Purana Kassapa</a>, in his 
classification of the <a href="chalabhijaatiya_s.htm" title="c/chalabhijaatiya_s.htm">chalabhijātas</a>, to be paramasukkabhijatas. (A.iii.384; 
DA.i.162; SNA.i.372, etc.; but see MA.ii.632, where they rank lower than the 
Ajivakas, who are there considered as the parama sukkkābhijātas.)</p>
<p>There seems to be some uncertainty as to Nanda’s name. The 
list in which the name occurs runs as follows:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Nanda Vaccho, Kiso Sankicco, 
Makkhali Gosālo.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Sutta Nipata Commentary (SNA.i.372.) seems to treat Nanda 
and Vaccha as two distinct persons. The Majjhima Commentary, (MA.i.463; see also 
M.i.524) however, says that Nanda was his personal name and Vaccha that of his 
gotta.</p>
<p>The austerities practised by Nanda Vaccha are detailed in 
the <a href="mahasaccaka_s.htm" title="maha/mahasaccaka_s.htm">Mahā Saccaka Sutta</a> (M.i.238) </p>
<p>Elsewhere (Ibid.524) the Buddha is reported as 
saying that though the Ajivakas had existed for a long time, they had only 
produced three distinguished leaders:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Nanda Vaccha,  </li>
  <li><a href="kisasankicca.htm" title="ku/kisasankicca.htm">Kisa Sankicca</a></li>
  <li><a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali Gosāla</a></li>
</ul>
