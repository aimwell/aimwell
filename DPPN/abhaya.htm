<p><b>1. Abhaya Thera.</b>-An arahant. He was a 
Brahmin of Sāvatthi who, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order. One 
day, while going to the village for alms, he was disturbed in mind by an 
attractively dressed woman, but he recollected himself and developed insight 
(Thag.v.98; ThagA.i.201-2).</p>
<p>In a former birth he had met Sumedha 
Buddha in the forest and had offered him a wreath of salala-flowers. Nineteen 
kappas ago he was born sixteen times as king, his name being Nimmita. He is 
probably to be identified with the Thera Vatamsakiya of the Apadāna (i.174).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Abhaya</b>.-Commonly called <b>Abhayarājakumāra</b>.  </p>
<p>He was the son of King <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> and of
<a href="padumavati.htm" title="pa/padumavati.htm">Padumavatī</a>, the belle 
of <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>. When the boy was seven years old, his mother sent him to the king and 
he grew up with the boys of the court. He first came under the influence of the 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a>, who taught him a dilemma to set the “Samana Gotama.” In the 
Buddha’s reply, the prince recognised the defeat of the 
<a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Nigantha</a> and the supreme 
Enlightenment of the Exalted One, whose disciple he then became. Later, when the 
king died, Abhaya was disturbed in mind, and entered the Order. On the occasion 
of the preaching of the <a href="t1_th.htm" title="t/t1_th.htm">Tālacchiggalūpama Sutta</a> (probably the same as S.v.455 
and M.iii.169), he became a Stream-enterer and afterwards attained arahantship 
(Thag.26; ThagA.i.83-4 also ThagA.39. In ThagA. his mother’s name does not 
appear). The <a href="abhayaraajakumaara_s.htm" title="am/abhayaraajakumaara_s.htm">Abhayarājakumāra Sutta</a> (M.i.392ff ) contains the dilemma episode. 
It also mentions that at the time the prince had a little son of whom he was 
evidently very fond.</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.126-8) he is 
stated as having visited the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at
<a href="gijjhakuuta.htm" title="g/gijjhakuuta.htm">Gijjhakūta</a> and discussed with him the 
views of <a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Pūrana Kassapa</a>. The Buddha teaches him about the seven 
bojjhangas.</p>
<p>In the Vinaya (i.269), Abhaya is 
mentioned as having discovered <a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka Komārabhacca</a> lying on a dung-heap (cast 
there by the orders of his mother, the courtesan Sālāvatī), and having brought 
him up.</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (i.216), on the 
other hand, says that Abhaya was Jīvaka’s natural father.</p>
<p>As a reward for quelling a disturbance 
on the frontier, Abhaya was given a skilled nautch girl by his father, 
Bimbisāra. For seven days he enjoyed her company to the exclusion of all else, 
but on the seventh day she died. Disconsolate, he sought comfort from the 
Buddha, who assuaged his grief (DhA.iii.166-67; cf. the story of Santati).</p>
<p>The Apadāna (ii.502-4) gives the story 
of his past. He had been a brahmin of Hamsavatī, skilled in the Vedas; having 
heard the Buddha Padumuttara preach, he was converted and joined the Order, 
where he spent his time singing the greatness of the Buddha.</p>
<p>The Theragāthā Commentary (i.83-4) 
quotes, in his story, some verses in the Apadāna, which in the Apadāna itself 
are ascribed to a Thera Ketakapupphiya. They state that he offered a ketaka-flower 
to the Buddha Vipassī, Perhaps Ketakapupphiya was the title of another Thera, 
whose real name was Abhaya, and hence the stories were confused (ii.449-50).</p>
<p>See also Abhaya (3).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Abhaya.</b>-A Licchavi of Vesāli 
generally (E.g., GS.i.200, n.2; ii.211, n.2; KS.v.107, n.2.), but wrongly, 
identified with Abhayarājakumāra. On one occasion he comes with another Licchavi, 
Pandita Kumāraka, to Ānanda in the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, and discusses with 
him certain views held by Nigantha Nātaputta. Ānanda teaches him the Buddha’s 
three Ways of purification (For details see A.i.220-2). On another occasion he 
visits the Buddha, again at Vesāli, with the Licchavi Sālha; the latter asks the 
Buddha’s views on purity of morals and self-mortification. The Buddha tells him 
of the Ariyan Way and explains its implications by various similes (See 
A.ii.202-4). We are not told that either of them became converts on this 
occasion.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Abhaya</b>.-A Thera. He and Tissadatta 
Thera are mentioned together, in several Commentaries (DA.iii.786; MA.i.234; 
AA.i.273; VibhA.275) as examples of persons worthy of being associated with, 
because of their possession of ready attention (upatthita-sati). This perhaps 
refers to Abhaya (1) or, more probably, to one of the three Abhayas mentioned 
with their titles in the Digha Commentary on the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta 
(DA.ii.530: Mahāgatimba-Abhaya, Dighabhānaka-Abhaya and Tipitaka Culābhaya) in 
its exegesis on the word upatthita-sati.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="5">5</a>. Abhaya</b>.-King of Ceylon (then known as Ojadīpa) in the time of Kakusandha Buddha. His capital was Abhayanagara. 
Sp.i.86; Mhv.xv.59.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Abhaya.</b>-King of Ceylon (414-394 
B.C.). He was the eldest son of Panduvāsudeva and reigned in Upatissagāma. 
Later, when the usurper Pandukābhaya came to the throne, he killed all his other 
nine uncles, sparing only Abhaya, because the latter had befriended both him and 
his mother, Ummādacittā. (It was he who prevented Cittā from being killed at 
birth, Mhv.ix.3). Abhaya was made Nagaraguttika (Guardian of the City), 
administering the government by night; he was the first holder of that office.
