<p>The country of the Sivi people, referred to several times 
in the Jātakas. In the <a href="sivi_jat_499.htm" title="s/sivi_jat_499.htm">Sivi</a>, 
<a href="ummadantii_jat_527.htm" title="u/ummadantii_jat_527.htm">Ummadantī</a> and 
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahāummagga</a> Jātakas (J.iv.401; v.210; 
vi.419), Aritthapura is given as the capital, while in the 
<a href="vessantara_jat_547.htm" title="vy/vessantara_jat_547.htm">Vessantara Jātaka</a> 
(J.vi.480), Jetuttara is the capital. </p>
<p>In the last named Jātaka (E.g., p.511), Vessantara is sometimes spoken of as king of Sivirattha and his children as 
Siviputtā (p.563). The family name of the kings of this country seems to have 
been Sivi (See J.vi.251, where Sivi is explained by porānakarājā). </p>
<p>The country was evidently famous for its cloth, which was 
called Siveyyaka (Vin.i.278). Pajjota gave a pair of robes of this material to 
<a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka</a>, as a present for his cure. These robes Jīvaka gave to the Buddha 
(Vin.i.280).</p>
