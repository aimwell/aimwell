  <h2>Pādañjali Jātaka (No. 247)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Brahmadatta, king of Benares, had a son Pādañjali, who was 
an idle loafer. When the king died, the courtiers, headed by the Bodhisatta who 
was the chaplain, went to test him. At everything the boy sneered with a 
superior air, whether it were right or wrong; and the Bodhisatta was made king 
in his stead.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
<a href="laludayi_th.htm" title="l/laludayi_th.htm">Lāludāyī</a>, who once 
curled his lip in scorn when the two chief disciples were praised. LāIudāyi is 
identified with Pādañjali. J.ii.263f.</p>
