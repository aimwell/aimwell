<p>Preached at Gay훮s카sa. The Buddha 
describes to the monks some of the stages through which he passed before 
reaching Enlightenment. At first he could only sec the light from the bodies of 
the devas; later, through conscious striving, he could distinguish their forms, 
talk with them, discover how they came to be born in their different spheres; 
then he was able to read their past births, and at last he attained to supreme 
knowledge. A.iv.302ff</p>
