<p><b>1. Veluvana. </b>A park near Rājagaha, the pleasure 
garden of Bimbisāra. When the Buddha first visited Rājagaha, after his 
Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyāna (Vin.i.35). The day after his 
arrival, he accepted the king’s invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end 
of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live&nbsp;&nbsp; “not too 
far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily 
accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise 
and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to 
seclusion“&nbsp;&nbsp; decided on Veluvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and 
the fraternity. This was the first ārāma accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was 
passed allowing monks to accept such an ārāma. Vin.i.39f.; according to BuA. 
(19; cf. ApA.i.75) the earth trembled when the water — 
poured over the Buddha’s hand by Bimbisāra in dedication of Veluvana — 
fell on the earth. This was the only ārāma in Jambudīpa, the dedication of which 
was accompanied by a tremor of the earth. It was the dedication of Veluvana 
which was quoted as precedent by Mahinda, when he decided to accept the 
Mahāmeghavana, at Anurādhapura, from Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xv.17).</p>
<p>The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during 
this stay that Sāriputta and Moggallāna joined the Order. Vin.i.42.</p>
<p>Kalandakanivāpa (q.v.) is the place nearly always 
mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veluvana. There many Vinaya 
rules were passed — e.g., on the keeping of the 
vassa (Vin.i.137), the use of food cooked in the monastery (Vin.i.210f), the 
picking of edible (kappiya) fruit in the absence of any layman from whom 
permission to do so could be obtained (Vin.i.212), surgical operations on monks 
(Vin.i.215f), the eating of sugar (Vin.i.226), the rubbing of various parts of 
the body against wood (Vin.ii.105), the use of the kinds of dwelling 
(Vin.ii.146) and the use of gold and silver (Vin.ii.196).</p>
<p>During the Buddha’s stay at Veluvana, Dabba Mallaputta, at 
his own request, was appointed regulator of lodgings and apportioner of rations, 
(Vin.ii.74. The Buddha was at Veluvana when Dabba also decided to die. He went 
there to take leave of the Buddha, Ud.viii.9) and Sāriputta and Moggallāna 
brought back the five hundred monks whom Devadatta had enticed away to Gayāsīsa 
(Vin.ii.200). The Buddha spent the second, third, and fourth vassas at Veluvana. 
BuA.3; it was while the Buddha was at Veluvana that Devadatta attempted to kill 
him by causing Nālāgiri to be let loose against him (J.v.335). It was a very 
peaceful place, and monks, who had taken part in the first Convocation, rested 
there, in Kalandakanivāpa, after their exertions. It was there that they met 
Purāna, who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of their Recital 
(Vin.ii.289f).</p>
<p>Numerous Jātakas were recited at Veluvana — 
e.g., Asampadāna, Upahāna, Ubhatobhattha, Kandagalaka, Kālabāhu, Kukkuta, 
Kumbhila, Kurunga, Kurungamiga, Giridanta, Guttila, Culladhammapāla, Cūlahamsa, 
Cūlanandiya, Jambu, Tayodhamma, Thusa, Dummedha, Dūbhiyamakkata, Dhammaddhaja, 
Nigrodha, Parantapa, Pucimanda, Mangala, Manicora, Manoja, Mahākapi, Mahāhamsa, 
Mūsika, Romaka, Rohantamiga, Ruru, Lakkhana, Latukika, Vānara, Vānarinda, 
Vinīlaka, Virocana, Saccankura, Sañjīva, Sabbadātha, Sarabhanga, Sāliya, Sigāla, 
Sīlavanāga, Suvannakakkata, Hamsa and Hāritamātā. Most 
of these refer to Devadatta, some to Ajātasattu, and some to Ānanda’s attempt to 
sacrifice his life for the Buddha.</p>
<p>The books mention, in addition, various suttas which were 
preached there. Among those who visited the Buddha at Veluvana were several 
devaputtas: Dīghalattha, Nandana, Candana, Sudatta, Subrahmā, Asama, Sahali, 
Ninka, Akotaka, Vetambari and Mānavagāmiya; also the Dhanañjanī brahmin; the 
Bhāradvājas: Akkosaka, Asurinda, Bilangika, Aggika, Acela Kassapa, Susīma; the 
thirty monks from Pāvā (S.ii.187); Theras, like Mahākappina Aññākondañña (just 
before his death); Sonagahapatiputta, Samiddhi, Moliya Sīvaka, Tālaputa, 
Manicūlaka, Mahācunda (during his illness), (S.v.181) Visākha (after his visit 
to Dhammadīnnā, who preached to him the Culla Vedalla Sutta), Abhayarājakumāra, 
Gulissāni, Vacchagotta, Bhūmija, Samiddhi, Aciravata, Sabhiya, Vassaka, 
Suppabuddha, Pilindavaccha, Jānussoni and the princess Cundī; also Bimbisāra’s 
wife, Khemā, who went to Veluvana because she had heard so much of its beauty. 
Sāriputta and Ānanda visited the Buddha there on several occasions, sometimes 
alone, sometimes in the company of others, and Ānanda lived there for some time 
after the Buddha’s death, and during his stay there preached the 
Gopakamoggallāna Sutta. </p>
<p>Sāriputta is mentioned as having held discussions there 
with, among others, Candikāputta and Lāludāyī. A sermon preached by Mahā Kassapa 
to the monks at Veluvana is given at A.v.161ff.; for other suttas preached by 
the Buddha, see also S.i.231; ii.32, 183, 242, 254; iv.20; v.446; Ud.iv.9.</p>
<p>It is said that Māra visited Veluvana several times (E.g., 
S.i.106f ) in order to work his will on the Buddha. The Buddha was there when 
three of the monks committed suicide — Vakkali, 
Godhika and Channa — and he had to pronounce 
them free from blame. News was brought to the Buddha, at Veluvana, of the 
illness of three of his disciples — Assaji, 
Moggallāna and Dīghāvu — and he set out to visit 
them and comfort them with talks on the doctrine. Near Veluvana was a 
Paribbājaka Rāma, where the Buddha sometimes went with some of his disciples in 
the course of his alms rounds. Two of his discussions there are recorded in the 
Cūla- and Mahā Sakuladāyī Suttas.</p>
<p>During the Buddha’s lifetime, two thūpas were erected at 
the gate of Veluvana, one containing the relics of Aññā Kondañña (SA.i.219), and 
the other those of Moggallāna (J.v.127).</p>
<p>Veluvana was so called because it was surrounded by 
bamboos (velu). It was surrounded by a wall, eighteen cubits high, holding a 
gateway and towers (SNA.ii.419; Sp.iii.576).</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, Dāsaka, Upāli’s pupil, lived at 
Veluvana, and there ordained Sonaka with fifty five companions. From there 
Sonaka went to the Kukkutārāma. (Mhv.v.115 f, 122; Dpv.iv.39).</p>
<p>The dedication of Veluvana was among the scenes depicted 
in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.80).</p>
<p>On one side of the main building of the Veluvana vihāra 
was a building called Ambalatthika (MA.ii.635). There was also a senāsana, built 
for the use of monks practising austerities (MA.ii.932).</p>
<p>It is said that, after death, Vassakāra was born as a 
monkey in Veluvana and answered to his name. He had been told during his 
lifetime that this destiny awaited him, and therefore took the precaution of 
seeing that the place was well supplied with fruit trees (MA.ii.854).</p>
<p>According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., ii.159), the 
Kalandaka nivāpa (Karandavenuvana, as he calls it) lay one li to the north of 
Rājagaha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Veluvana. </b>A bamboo grove in Kajangalā, where the 
Buddha once stayed. The upāsakas of Kajangalā, having questioned the Kajangalā-Bhikkhunī, 
went to the Buddha there and asked him to verify her answers. A.v.54f</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Veluvana. </b>A bamboo grove in Kimbilā, where the 
Buddha stayed and was visited by Kimbila. A.iii.247, 339: iv.84.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Veluvana.</b> A monastery in Ceylon, built by 
Aggabodhi II. It was given by him to the Sāgalikas (Cv.xlii.43). It probably lay 
between Anurādhapura and Manihīra, and Sanghatissa once lay in hiding there 
disguised as a monk (Cv.xliv.29; Cv.Trs.i.77, n.2). Jetthatissa III. gave to the 
vihāra the village of Kakkalavitthi. Cv.xliv.99.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Veluvana.</b> A monastery erected by Parakkamabāhu 
I. in the suburb of Vijita in Pulatthipura. It consisted of three image houses, 
each three storeys high, a thūpa, a cloister, a two storeyed pāsāda, four 
gateways, four long pāsādas, eight small ones, one refectory, one sermon hall, 
seven fire hoses and twelve privies. Cv.lxxiii.152, lxxviii.87f.; see also 
Cv.Trs.ii.113, n.1.</p>
