<p><b>1. Sabbamitta Thera.</b> He belonged to a brahmin 
family of Sāvatthi, and entered the Order after seeing the Buddha’s acceptance 
of Jetavana. He dwelt in the forest, meditating. Once, on his way to Sāvatthi to 
worship the Buddha, he saw a fawn caught in a trapper’s net. The doe, though not 
in the net, remained near, out of love for her young, yet not daring to approach 
the snare. The Thera was much moved by the thought of all the suffering which 
was caused by love. Farther on he saw bandits wrapping in straw a man whom they 
had caught and were preparing to set on fire. The Thera was filled with anguish, 
and, developing insight, won arahantship. He uttered, in his anguish, the two 
verses included in Thag. 149 50. He preached to the bandits and they joined the 
Order under him.</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha, he was a hunter who lived on 
game. One day, the Buddha, out of compassion for him, left three of his 
footprints outside his hut. The hunter saw them, and, owing to good deeds done 
in the past, recognized them as the Buddha’s, and offered to them koranda 
flowers. After death he was born in Tāvatimsa (ThagA.i.269f). His Apadāna verses 
are given in two places under the name of Korandapupphiya (q.v.). Ap.ii.383, 
434; cf. Sugandha Thera.</p>
