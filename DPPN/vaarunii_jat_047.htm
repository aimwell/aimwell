<p>The Bodhisatta once had a friend who was a tavern keeper. 
One day the tavern keeper made ready a supply of strong spirits and went to 
bathe, leaving his apprentice, Kondañña, in charge. The latter, who had seen 
customers send for salt and jagghery to make their drink more appetizing, 
pounded some salt and put it in the liquor, hoping to improve it.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a friend of 
Anāthapindika who was a tavern keeper, whose apprentice did likewise. J.i.251ff.</p>
