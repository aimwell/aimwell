<p>A ford in the Mahāvāluka gangā, to the south of 
Pulatthipura. Vijayabāhu IV., at the instigation of his father, Parakkamabāhu 
II., arranged that the whole community of monks in Ceylon should assemble there 
and perform the ceremony of admitting new members into the Order (Cv.lxxxvii.71; 
for identification see Cv.Trs.ii.182, n.4). In this he was assisted by his 
brother, Vīrabāhu, and the Chronicles (E.g., Cv.lxxxix.47ff) give great details 
of the preparations for the ceremony, which lasted for a fortnight. At the 
conclusion, Vijayabāhu conferred various ranks on the most eminent monks.</p>
