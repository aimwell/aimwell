<p>Once when the Buddha is staying at Icch훮nangala, with 
N훮gita as his attendant, the brahmins of Icch훮nangala come to pay him homage 
with various kinds of offerings and make a great noise and uproar as they wait 
outside the gate. </p>
<p>The Buddha is disturbed by their noise and expresses his 
disapproval, whereupon, N훮gita begs of him to accept their homage and their 
gifts, The Buddha answers that he has no need for them; he has attained the 
happiness of renunciation, of insight, of awakening, of calm; happiness 
proceeding from gains and flattery is dung like. </p>
<p>He knows of monks who joke and make merry, who eat their 
bellies full and give themselves up to languor and torpor, or live on the 
outskirts of some village. They do not please him, but a forest dwelling monk 
pleases him because he knows that, some day, that monk will find emancipation.
