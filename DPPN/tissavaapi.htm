<p>1. Tissavāpi.-A tank near Anurādhapura, 
probably built by Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xx.20). It seems to have been customary 
for the king to take a ceremonial bath in the Tissavāpi, after his coronation 
festival (E.g., Mhv.xxvi.7; xxxv.38; MT.645), and, on this occasion, the 
Lambakannas formed the king’s bodyguard (See, e.g., Mhv.xxxv.16, 38). The road 
from Mahiyangama to Anurādhapura lay along the edge of the Tissavāpi 
(Mhv.xxxvi.59).</p>
<p>2. Tissavāpi.-A tank in the 
neighbourhood of Mahāgāma, built by Ilanāga (Mhv.xxxv.32).</p>
