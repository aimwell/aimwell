  <h2>Tirokudda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the five suttas included in the 
Khuddaka-Pātha. Departed spirits haunt their old dwelling places and their 
compassionate kinsmen should bestow on them in due time, food, drink, etc. and 
also give gifts to the monks in their name. Thus will they be happy (Khp., p.6).
</p>
<p>The Sutta was preached on the third day 
of the Buddha’s visit to Rājagaha. On the previous night, Petas had made a great 
uproar in Bimbisāra’s palace. In the time of Phussa Buddha, they had been 
workmen entrusted with the task of distributing alms to the Buddha and his 
monks, but they had been negligent in their duties and had appropriated some of 
the gifts for themselves. As a result, they suffered for a long period in 
purgatory and became Petas in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Kassapa told them that 
in the future, Bimbisāra, who had once been their kinsman, would entertain the 
Buddha Gotama and make over the merit to them. They had long waited for this 
occasion and when Bimbisāra failed to fulfil their expectations, they made great 
outcry.</p>
<p>The Buddha explained this to Bimbisāra, 
who thereupon gave alms in the name of the Petas, thus making them happy. It was 
on this occasion that the Sutta was preached. KhpA.202ff; cp. PvA.19ff.</p>
