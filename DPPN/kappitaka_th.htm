<p>He was upajjhāya to 
<a href="upaali.htm" title="u/upaali.htm">Upāli</a>, and once 
lived in a cemetery near <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. In the cemetery the
<a href="chabbaggiyaa.htm" title="c/chabbaggiyaa.htm">Chabbaggiya</a>-nuns buried the 
ashes of one of their leaders and erected a thūpa near Kappitaka’s cell. The 
Elder, disturbed by the sound of their lamentations, broke the thūpa and 
scattered the materials. The nuns, greatly angered, plotted to kill him, but he 
was warned by Upāli, and lay hidden elsewhere until the nuns had destroyed his 
cell and gone away under the impression that he was dead. The nuns blamed Upāli 
for upsetting their arrangements (Vin.iv.308).  </p>
<p>According to the Peta-vatthu and 
its Commentary (Pv.50; PvA.229ff), Kappitaka lived in <a href="kapinacanaa.htm" title="ka/kapinacanaa.htm">Kapinaccāna</a> (near Vesāli), 
and there the Licchavi <a href="ambasakkhara.htm" title="am/ambasakkhara.htm">Ambasakkhara</a> offered him alms on behalf of a peta. He was 
evidently at one time a <a href="jatila.htm" title="j/jatila.htm">Jatila</a>, with a large following of Jatilas, for he is 
described as “jatilasahassassa abbhantaro thero.” Sp.iv.937; PvA.230.</p>
