<p>The Bodhisatta was once a brahmin teacher of great fame. 
Among his pupils were five hundred brahmins, versed in the three Vedas, who 
thought they knew as much as their teacher. The Bodhisatta, aware of this, gave 
them a riddle to solve: “Time consumes all, even itself, but who can consume the 
all consumer?” For a whole week they tried to find a solution and then owned 
defeat. The Bodhisatta rebuked them, saying that they had holes in their ears 
but no wisdom. Their pride was quelled, and from that time they honored their 
teacher.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to some monks: to whom the 
Mūla-pariyāya Sutta was preached. The disciples are 
the same in both cases. J.ii.259 262.</p>
