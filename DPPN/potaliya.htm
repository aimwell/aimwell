<h4>1. Potaliya</h4>
<p>A householder of Āpana. Meeting the Buddha in a wood 
outside the town, he greeted him, and was addressed by the Buddha as 
“householder,” at which he was very angry, for he had, so he said, handed over 
his wealth to his sons, and possessed only his food and clothing. But the Buddha 
told him that true retirement from the household meant far more than that, and, 
at the request of Potaliya, he proceeded to explain his words. At the end of the 
discourse Potaliya declared himself the Buddha’s follower. M.i.359 ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Potaliya</h4>
<p>A wanderer (Paribbājāka) probably identical with the above 
(1). A conversation he had with the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya. 
At the end of the discussion he declared himself the Buddha’s follower. 
A.ii.100f.</p>
