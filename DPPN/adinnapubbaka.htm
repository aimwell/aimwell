</ul>
<p>A brahmin of Sāvatthi, father of 
Mattakundalī, so called because he never gave anything to anyone. </p>
<p>When, later, Mattakundalī, having been 
born in heaven, visits him and persuades him to take refuge with the Buddha, he 
invites the Buddha with his monks to a meal at his house. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meal 
Mattakundalī appears again and Adinnapubbaka, after listening to the Buddha’s 
preaching, attains the First Fruit of the Path. DhA.i.25-30; VvA.322f.</p>
