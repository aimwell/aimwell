  <h2>Siri Jātaka (No. 284)</h2>
  </li>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ascetic and had, as patron, an 
elephant trainer. A stick gatherer, sleeping at night in a temple, heard two 
cocks, roosting on a tree near by, abusing each other. In the course of the 
quarrel one cock boasted that whoever ate his flesh would be king; his exterior, 
commander in chief or chief queen; his bones, royal treasurer or king’s 
chaplain. The man killed the cock and his wife cooked it; then, taking it with 
them, they went to the river to bathe. They left the meat and the rice on the 
bank, but, as they bathed, a breeze blew the pot holding the food into the 
river. It floated down stream, where it was picked up by the elephant trainer. 
The Bodhisatta saw all this with his divine eye and visited the trainer at meal 
time. There he was offered the meat and divided it, giving the flesh to the 
trainer, the exterior to his wife, and keeping the bones for himself. Three days 
later the city was besieged by enemies. The king asked the trainer to don royal 
robes and mount the elephant, while he himself fought in the ranks. There he was 
killed by an arrow, and the trainer, having won the battle, was made king, his 
wife being queen, and the ascetic his chaplain.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a brahmin who tried to 
steal Anāthapindika’s good fortune (siri). He perceived that this lay in a white 
cock, for which he begged. Anāthapindika gave it to him, but the good fortune 
left the cock and settled in a jewel. He asked for that also and was given it. 
But the good fortune went into a club. The club was also asked for, and 
Anāthapindika giving it, asked the brahmin to take it and be gone. But the good 
fortune now settled on Anāthapindika’s wife. The brahmin then owned defeat, and 
confessed his intentions to Anāthapindika, who told the story to the Buddha. 
J.ii.409ff.; cf. Khadiranga Jātaka.</p>
