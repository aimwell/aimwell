<p><b>1. Mallikā Sutta.</b>
  <a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a> visits the Buddha and asks him why some women are 
beautiful, others plain, some rich, others poor. The Buddha explains that if a 
woman be ill tempered and irritable, jealous and slow to give alms, such a one 
becomes poor and of ill favour, wherever she may happen to be born. A woman, 
however, who never becomes angry or agitated even under great provocation, and 
is generous, such a one becomes beautiful and rich.</p>
<p>Mallikā declares her determination for the future, to be 
gentle in temper, never revengeful or harbouring a grudge, but always amiable 
and generous. A.ii.202ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Mallikā Sutta.</b> <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> asks
  <a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a>, as they sit on the upper terrace of the 
  palace, if anyone is dearer to her than her own “self ”; she says “No one.” He 
  says that the same is true of him, but is evidently piqued, for he seeks the 
  Buddha; the Buddha tells him that Mallikā has spoken truly and well. S.i.75.</p>
