<p>One of the legal ministers (dhammānusāsaka) 
of King Vedeha of Mithilā (J.vi.330ff). On the fast-day of the dark fortnight a 
Yakkha named Naradeva took possession of him and he barked like a mad dog. His 
son, knowing this, shut him up indoors on these occasions. When the king 
discovered this, Kāvinda was cast into prison and ordered to be flogged for 
plotting against Mahosadha, but at the latter’s request he was pardoned.</p>
<p>In the present age he was Ambattha 
(J.vi.478).</p>
