  <h2>1. Bandhura Thera</h2>

</ul>
<p>Son of the setthi of <b>Sīlavatī</b>. Having gone to <b>
Sāvatthi</b> on business and heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order, 
winning arahantship in due course. He later returned to Silāvatī and preached to 
the king, who became a convert, and built for him a vihāra called <b>Sudassana</b> 
and paid him great honour. Bandhura gave the vihāra to the monks and returned to 
Sāvatthi, saying that he had no need of possessions.</p>
<p>In the time of <b>Siddhattha Buddha</b> he was a watchman 
in the king’s palace and offered kanavera flowers to the Buddha and his monks. 
Thag.vs.103; ThagA.207f.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with <b>Kanaverapupphiya</b> of 
the Apadāna (Ap.i.182). v.l. <b>Sandhaya</b>, <b>Sandhava</b>.</p>
