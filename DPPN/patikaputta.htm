  <h2>Pātikaputta</h2>

<p>A naked ascetic of Vesāli who went about claiming to have 
greater mystic powers than the Buddha, and thereby much impressed Sunakkhatta. 
Pātikaputta had prophesied that, after death, the Licchavi general Ajita would 
be born in Mahā Niraya, but Ajita was born in Tāvatimsa and accused Pātikaputta 
of being a liar. Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pātikaputta, with a 
large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pātikaputta avoided him and 
went to the Tindukhānuparibbājakārāma. A message was sent to him asking him to 
come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise 
from his seat. Thereupon, a Licchavi minister, and, after him, Jāliya 
Dārupattikantevāsi, went to fetch him, but on discovering that he could not 
rise, they reviled him for his boastfulness. A.iii.13ff.</p>
