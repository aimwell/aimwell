<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a Brahmin teacher, and among his 
five hundred pupils was a very foolish but devoted youth, who had a knack of 
saying the wrong thing. Hoping to cure him, the Bodhisatta asked him to report 
anything which he saw.</p>
<p>One day the youth saw a snake, and on being asked by the 
Bodhisatta how it looked, he answered, “like the shaft of a plough” (nangalisa). 
The Bodhisatta thought the simile good, but when it was used again about an 
elephant, a sugar cane, molasses and even curds and milk, he realized that the 
boy was hopeless. The story was told in reference to 
<a href="laludayi_th.htm" title="l/laludayi_th.htm">Lāludāyi</a>, who never made an 
appropriate remark. Lāludayi is identified with the youth.&nbsp; J.i.446ff.</p>
