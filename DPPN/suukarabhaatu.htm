<p>An officer of Mānābharana. He was captured and put in 
chains by Parakkamabāhu I. He escaped, however, and the Adhikāri Mañju was sent 
to seize him. Sūkarabhātu became the commander-in-chief of the rebels and caused 
great damage to Parakkamabāhu’s forces. It was not until Damilādhikāri and 
Lankāpura Deva concentrated all their attention on him that he could be 
defeated. He died fighting, near Mahānāgahula. Cv.lxxiv.127f., 153; lxxv.126f.</p>
