  <h2>Udumbara Jātaka (No. 298)</h2>

<p>The story of two monkeys. One, small and 
red-faced, lived in a rock cave. During heavy rains, the other, a large and 
black-faced monkey, saw him, and wishing to have the shelter for himself, sent 
him away, on the pretext that outside in the forest there was plenty of food to 
be had. The small monkey was taken in by the trick, and when he came back he 
found the other monkey, with his family, installed in the cave.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who lived comfortably in a village hermitage and was ousted from there by 
another monk whom he had welcomed as a guest. J.ii.444-6.</p>
