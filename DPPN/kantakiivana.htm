<p>A grove near Sāketa. The conversation 
which took place there between Sāriputta and Moggallāna is recorded in the 
Padesa Sutta (S.v.174f). A discussion which took place there on another occasion 
between these two and Anuruddha, is given in the Kantakī Sutta (S.v.298f). The 
grove was evidently also called Tikantakī and the Commentary describes it as 
mahā-karamadda-vana, karamadda being a shrub (carissa carandas). The Buddha also 
stayed in this grove, and a sermon preached by him to the monks is recorded in 
the Tikantakī Sutta (A.v.169).</p>
