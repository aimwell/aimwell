<h4>1. Nanda Thera</h4>
<p>Son of <a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a> and
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahāpajāpatī</a>, and therefore half 
brother of the Buddha.&nbsp; He was only a few days younger than the Buddha, and 
when the Buddha’s mother died, Pajapati gave her own child to nurses and suckled 
the Buddha herself (AA.i.186).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the third day of the Buddha’s visit to <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>, 
after the Enlightenment, the Buddha went to Nanda’s house, where festivities 
were in progress in honour of Nanda’s coronation and marriage to 
<a href="janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm" title="j/janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm">Janapadakalyānī Nandā</a>. The Buddha wished Nanda good fortune and handed him his bowl to be taken 
to the vihāra. Nanda, thereupon, accompanied the Buddha out of the palace. 
Janapadakalyānī, seeing him go, asked him to return quickly. Once inside the 
vihāra, however, the Buddha asked Nanda to become a monk, and he, unable to 
refuse the request, agreed with reluctance. But as the days passed he was 
tormented with thoughts of his beloved, and became very downcast and despondent, 
and his health suffered. The Buddha suggested that they should visit the 
Himālaya. On the way there, he showed Nanda the charred remains of a female 
monkey and asked him whether Janapadakalyānī were more beautiful than that. The 
answer was in the affirmative. The Buddha then took him to Tāvatimsa where 
Sakka, with his most beautiful nymphs, waited on them. In answer to a question 
by the Buddha, Nanda admitted that these nymphs were far more attractive than 
Janapadakalyānī, and the Buddha promised him one as wife if he would live the 
monastic life. Nanda was all eagerness and readily agreed. On their return to 
Jetavana the Buddha related this story to the eighty chief disciples, and when 
they questioned Nanda, he felt greatly ashamed of his lustfulness. Summoning all 
his courage, he strove hard and, in no long time, attained arahantship. He 
thereupon came to the Buddha and absolved him from his promise. (Thag.157f.; 
J.i.91; ii.92ff.; Ud.iii.2; DhA.i.96 105; UdA.168ff.; SNA.273f.) </p>
<p>When the Buddha was told of Nanda’s arahantship by a 
devata, he related the Sangāmāvacara Jataka (q.v.) to show how, in the past, 
too, Nanda had been quick to follow advice. He also related the story of Kappata 
(q.v.) and his donkey to show that it was not the first time that Nanda had been 
won to obedience by the lure of the female sex. The male donkey in the story was 
Nanda and the female donkey Janapadakalyānī. (DhA.i.103f.)</p>
<p>Nanda is identified with the sub king (uparājā) in the 
Kurudhamma Jataka (q.v.).</p>
<p>Later, on seeing how eminently Nanda was trained in self 
control, the Buddha declared him chief among his disciples in that respect (indriyesu 
guttadvārānam). Nanda had aspired to this eminence in the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha. In the time of Atthadassi Buddha he was a tortoise in the river Vinatā, 
and, seeing the Buddha on the bank waiting to cross, he took him over to the 
other side on his back. (A.i.25; AA.i.174f.; ThagA.i.276ff.) </p>
<p>He is said to have been called Nanda because his birth 
brought joy to his kinsmen. The Apadāna (i.57) says he was of golden hue, as 
reward for a gift of a costly robe given by him to Padumuttara. One hundred 
thousand kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Cela. Sixty 
thousand kappas ago he was again king in four births, under the name of Upacela. 
Later, five thousand kappas ago, he was four times cakkavatti, and his name 
then, too, was Cela.</p>
<p>Nanda was very beautiful, and was only four inches shorter 
than the Buddha. He once wore a robe made according to the dimensions of the 
Buddha’s robe. Discovering this, the Buddha chided him for his presumption. 
(Vin.iv.173; perhaps this is another version of the story found at S.ii.281. 
There, Nanda is said to have donned a robe which was pressed on both sides, 
painted his face, and gone to see the Buddha, carrying a bright bowl. The Buddha 
chided him, and Nanda thereupon became a forest dweller and a rag-robe-man. 
Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.174) says that Nanda dressed himself up in order to evoke 
some comment from the Buddha — either approval, so that he might dress thus for 
the remainder of his life, or censure, in which case he would put on rag robes 
and dwell in the forest.) </p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv.166f) contains a discourse in 
which the Buddha discusses Nanda’s claim to have achieved self control in all 
things.</p>
<p>He is probably to be identified with Taraniya Thera of the 
Apadāna. (ii.428; cp. ThagA.i.277.)</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nanda</h4>
<p>Called <b>Nanda mānava</b>. One of the chief disciples of 
<a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a>; 
he visited the Buddha: His conversation with the Buddha is recorded in the
<a href="n1_nan.htm#Nandamanava" title="n/n1_nan.htm#Nandamanava">Nanda 
mānavapucchā</a>. Later, he became an arahant. SN.vs.1007, 1124.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nanda</h4>
<p>Called <b>Nanda-Gopālaka</b>. He was a cowherd of Kosambi. One 
day he heard the Buddha preach to the monks, using as simile a log of wood&nbsp;&nbsp; 
how, in certain circumstances, it finds its way direct to the sea&nbsp;&nbsp; 
and how, similarly, a monk may reach nibbina. Nanda asked permission to join the 
Order. But the Buddha insisted that he should first return the cattle, for which 
he was responsible, to their owners. Nanda did so, and was then ordained, 
becoming an arahant soon after. S.iv.181.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nanda Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. In the past he was once a hunter, and, while 
wandering in the forest, he saw a Pacceka Buddha named Anuruddha. He built for 
the Buddha a hut thatched with lotus flowers, and, having listened to the 
Buddha’s preaching, became a monk. Soon after he fell ill, died, and was born in 
Tusita. He possessed the power of traveling through the air and of walking over 
the sea. In this birth he visited the Buddha and questioned him regarding the 
“further shore.” At the end of the conversation he became an arahant. 
Ap.ii.350f.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with No. 3 above. See DA.i.122, 
where Nanda Gopalaka’s questions are given; these seem to correspond with Nanda 
Thera’s questions about the “further shore.”</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nanda</h4>
<p>A herdsman of Anāthapindika, living in Sāvatthi. He was 
rich and tended the king’s cattle as well. He often, went to Anāthapindika’s 
house with gifts, and there he saw and heard the Buddha. He invited the Buddha 
to his house, but his invitation was not accepted for some time, until his 
wisdom should be ripe. But at last the Buddha paid him a visit, lasting seven 
days, and Nanda entertained him and his monks with the choicest foods. On the 
seventh day the Buddha preached to him and he became a sotapanna. He accompanied 
the Buddha part of the way back to the vihāra, but, on his return journey, was 
killed by a hunter’s arrow. DhA.i.322f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Nanda mānava</h4>
<p>A former incarnation of Subhūti Thera (q.v.) in the time 
of Padumuttara Buddha. He was a mahāsala Brahmin of Hamsavatī, and later became 
an ascetic at the head of forty four thousand Jatilas. After thirty thousand 
years, Padumuttara visited him in the forest, and, later, ten thousand of his 
followers joined the Buddha. Nanda provided them all with seats made of heavenly 
flowers, the Buddha’s being one league in height. Nanda stood by the Buddha for 
seven days, holding an umbrella made of flowers. Nanda and the rest of his 
disciples joined the Order, and all except Nanda became arahants, he being bore 
in the Brahma world after death. Later, for five hundred births he was a forest 
dweller living alone on Mount Nisabha in Himavā. He was king of the devas for 
eighty births. (Ap.i.67; ThagA.i.17f.; AA.i.124f.) He evidently belonged to the 
Kosiya gotta (Ap.i.67.)</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Nanda</h4>
<p>A disciple of a Pacceka Buddha named Sabbābhibhū. The 
Bodhisatta was then a drunkard, named Munāli, and abused Nanda. It was a result 
of this that Ciñcā slandered the Buddha (<a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a>). Ap.i.299; UdA.264.</p>
<hr>
<h4>8. Nanda</h4>
<p>A devaputta who visited the Buddha and had a conversation 
with him. S.i.62.</p>
<hr>
<h4>9. Nanda</h4>
<p>One of the three palaces occupied by 
<a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī Buddha</a> in his 
last lay life. Bu.xx.24.</p>
<hr>
<h4>10. Nanda</h4>
<p>One of the chief lay supporters of 
<a href="sikhii.htm" title="s/sikhii.htm">Sikhī Buddha</a>. v.l Canda. 
BuA.204.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="11">11</a>. Nanda</h4>
<p>King of Benares, a former birth of 
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>. He 
belonged to a poor family, but, owing to his merit in having covered Kassapa 
Buddha’s cetiya with a golden coverlet, he came to be crowned king of Benares. 
He had a kapparukkha, which provided him and his subjects with divine robes. 
With the help of his queen&nbsp;-&nbsp; who became
<a href="bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm" title="b/bhadda_kapilani_thi.htm">Bhaddakapilā</a> in this life&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
he held a great almsgiving to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, led by
<a href="mahapaduma.htm" title="maha/mahapaduma.htm">Mahāpaduma</a>, 
and entertained them up to the time of their death. Nanda was away, quelling a 
frontier rebellion, at the time of their death. On his return, he gave over his 
kingdom to his eldest son and became an ascetic. Ap.ii.582; ThagA.ii.139ff.; 
SA.ii.140f.; the story is also found at PVA.73ff.; there it is said that Nanda 
was granted divine clothes because he had once given his shawl to a Pacceka 
Buddha for a robe; see also ThigA.72.</p>
<p>Nanda’s wealth was proverbial. E.g., Pv.ii.1 (vs. 16), 
iii.2 (vs.16).</p>
<hr>
<h4>12. Nanda</h4>
<p>One of the chief lay supporters of 
<a href="mangala.htm" title="ma/mangala.htm">Mangala Buddha</a>. Bu.xxii. 
25.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Nanda.</b> See <a href="nanda_vaccha.htm" title="n/nanda_vaccha.htm">Nanda Vaccha</a></p>
<hr>
<h4>14. Nanda</h4>
<p>A slave, born in this life as the co resident of 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sariputta</a>. 
For his story see the <a href="nanda_jat_39.htm" title="n/nanda_jat_39.htm">Nanda Jataka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>15. Nanda</h4>
<p>A brahmin of Takkasilā, learned in the Vedas, who 
supported his parents. He related four verses to Jayaddisa, seated on a throne, 
and earned four thousand pieces of money. For details see the 
<a href="jayaddisa_jat_513.htm" title="j/jayaddisa_jat_513.htm">Jayaddisa Jataka</a>. 
J.v.23ff.</p>
<p>This is evidently the same story as that related in the 
<a href="mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm" title="maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm">Mahā Sutasoma Jataka</a> (J.v.476f.,483). There Nanda is said to have learnt the 
stanzas from Kassapa Buddha, and to have come expressly to Indapatta in order to 
teach them to Sutasoma. Nanda is identified with Ānanda. (Ibid. 511. For details 
see the Mahā Sutasoma Jataka.</p>
<hr>
<h4>16. Nanda</h4>
<p>Called <b><a name="Nandakumara">Nandakumāra</a></b>. A Brahmin ascetic, brother of the 
Bodhisatta in his birth as Sona. Nanda is identified with Ānanda. For details 
see <a href="sonĀnanda_jat_532.htm" title="s/sonĀnanda_jat_532.htm">Sona Nanda Jataka</a>. J.v.312ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>17. Nanda</h4>
<p>A Brahmin, mentioned in the Milindapanha [p.101. This 
probably refers to the Brahmin Ānanda (q.v.) who raped Upalavannā (DhA.ii.49); 
this is confirmed by MA.ii.814, where Uppalavannā’s seducer is called Nanda 
mānavaka] as having been swallowed up by the earth for having insulted the 
Buddha and his disciples.</p>
<hr>
<h4>18. Nanda</h4>
<p>See <a href="nandopĀnanda.htm" title="n/nandopĀnanda.htm">NandopĀnanda</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>19. Nanda Kumāputta Thera</h4>
<p>He was born in Velukanoa in Avanti and his mother was Kuma. 
Having heard Sariputta preach, he entered the Order, visiting the Buddha later. 
From the Buddha he obtained a formula of meditation and became an arahant. 
(Thag.vs.36; ThagA.i.100) He had a friend named Sudanta (also called Vāsula) 
who, too, became an arahant (Ibid.101). In the time of Vipassi Buddha, Nanda was 
an ascetic, and, having seen the Buddha in the royal park at Bandhumati, gave 
him oil to massage his feet. He is probably to be identified with 
Abbhañjanadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.456.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="20-Nava-Nanda">20</a>. Nanda</h4>
<p>Nine kings, called the <b>Nava Nandā</b>, reigned in India after 
the dynasty of <a href="kaalaasoka.htm" title="ka/kaalaasoka.htm">Kālāsoka</a> and his sons. (Mhv.v.15) The first of the Nava-Nandā was 
a bandit who captured the throne. Their names are given in the 
<a href="mahabodhivamsa.htm" title="maha/mahabodhivamsa.htm">Mahābodhivamsa</a> 
(p.98; for details see MT.177 9) as follows: Uggasena Nanda, Panduka Nanda, 
Pandugati Nanda, Bhūtapāla Nanda, Ratthapāla Nanda, Govisānaka-Nanda, 
Dasasiddhaka Nanda, Kevatta Nanda and Dhana Nanda. The last was killed by 
Candagutta with the help of Cānakka, and his throne was seized. The nine Nandas 
together reigned for twenty two years.</p>
<hr>
<h4>21. Nanda</h4>
<p>There were once two butchers named Nanda. One day they 
killed a cow, and the younger asked that he might take the head and the tail as 
he had many children. The elder refused and was killed by the other. But the 
murderer had no peace of mind thereafter, and, on his death, was born in hell. 
ItvA.82; also AA.i.295; but here the names are not mentioned.</p>
<hr>
<h4>22. Nanda</h4>
<p>A distinguished monk in the time of Parakkamabāhu I. He 
lived in the Selantara monastery, and was appointed Head of the three 
fraternities in Rohana. Cv.lxxviii.10.</p>
<hr>
<h4>23. Nanda</h4>
<p>A butcher who killed cattle for fifty years. One day, 
having no meat, he cut off the tongue of a living ox, fried it and started 
eating it. His own tongue fell on to his plate. He died in great agony and was 
born in hell. MA.ii.814.</p>
<hr>
<h4>24. Nanda</h4>
<p>The Isigili Sutta mentions four Pacceka Buddhas of this 
name. M.iii.70.</p>
