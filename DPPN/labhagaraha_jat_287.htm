  <h2>Lābhagaraha Jātaka (No. 287)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha was once a famous teacher of the Vedas with 
five hundred pupils. One pupil asked him how people could obtain gain in this 
world. His teacher answered that in a world full of fools the man who slanders, 
possesses the tricks of an actor and carries evil talk, gains prosperity. The 
pupil expressed his disappointment and continued his religious life.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a colleague who 
asked Sāriputta the same question and received the above answer. J.ii.420-3.</p>
