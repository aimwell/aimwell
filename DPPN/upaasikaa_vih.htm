<p>A nunnery in Anurādhapura, built by 
Devānampiyatissa, for the accommodation of Anulā and her followers, pending the 
arrival of Sanghamittā (Mhv.xviii.12). Later, Sanghamittā took up her residence 
there and it was enlarged by the addition of twelve buildings, three of which 
gained peculiar sanctity because in these were set up the mast, the rudder and 
the helm of the ship that had brought the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, and these 
buildings were called, respectively, the Kupayatthithapita-ghara, the 
Piyathapita-ghara and the Arittathapita-ghara. Even when other sects arose, 
these twelve buildings were occupied by the Hatthālhaka (or orthodox) nuns. 
Mhv.xix.68ff; the Tikā (p.408) says the houses were originally called 
Cūlaganā-gāra, Mahāganāgāra and Sirivaddhāgāra. </p>
