<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as 
Dhatarattha, king of ninety thousand golden geese living in Cittakūta. One day 
some of his flock came upon Lake Mānusiya, near the haunts of men, and finding 
it a rich feeding-ground, persuaded him much against his will to go there with 
them. But immediately he alighted he was caught in a fowler’s noose and found 
escape impossible. He waited till the flock had fed, then gave the cry of alarm 
at which all the geese flew away except his commander-in-chief, Sumukha. When 
the fowler came, Sumukha offered to give his life for his king, and thereby 
softened the fowler’s heart. The latter set Dhatarattha free and tended his 
wounds, and because of the man’s great charity the king of the geese became 
whole again. When the fowler suggested that they should fly home, the two geese 
insisted that they should be taken to Sakula, the king of the land, the 
Mahimsaka country, that they might obtain for the fowler a suitable reward. When 
the king heard the story he gave to the fowler a village yielding one hundred 
thousand annually, a chariot and a large store of gold. Dhatarattha preached to 
the king the moral law and, after being paid great honour, returned to Cittakūta.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Ānanda’s attempt to offer his life in order to save the Buddha from being killed 
by the elephant Nālāgiri (q.v.). Channa is identified with the fowler, Sāriputta 
with the king, and Ānanda with Sumukha. J.v.333-.54; DhA.i.119; cf. the 
Mahāhamsa Jātaka and the Hamsa Jātaka.</p>
