<p>A country whose people were called Colā. 
The country extended from the Coromandel coast of South India as far as the 
Penner River, its capital in mediaeval times being Tanjore. The Ceylon 
Chronicles mention frequent invasions of Ceylon by the Colā chiefly for purposes 
of plunder. These invasions were a constant menace to the peace and prosperity 
of Ceylon, and helped largely in the destruction and disappearance of that 
country’s literary and artistic works. For details see Mhv. and Cv. passim.</p>
