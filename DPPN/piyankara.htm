<p>A little boy Yakkha. While his mother, with him on her 
hip, was seeking for food at night, she came unexpectedly to Jetavana where 
Anuruddha was reciting some verses. The sound pleased her and she stood “smitten 
to the marrow, like a post,” hushing to sleep her child who was whimpering for 
food. S.209; also Vsm.382; DA.ii.509; and PSA.79, where she is called a vimāna 
peta.</p>
