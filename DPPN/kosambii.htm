  <h2>Kosambī</h2>

</ul>
<p>The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; 
vi.236). In the time of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> its king was Parantapa, 
and after him reigned his son <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>. (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f). Kosambī 
was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna 
(D.ii.146,169). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a> 
and <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> from the south and the west. (See, e.g., Vin.i.277). </p>
<p>The city was 
thirty leagues by river from Benares. (Thus we are told that the fish which 
swallowed <a href="bakkula.htm" title="b/bakkula.htm">Bakkula</a> travelled thirty leagues through the 
<a href="yamunaa.htm" title="y/yamunaa.htm">Yamunā</a>, from Kosambī to 
Benares, AA.i.170; PsA.491). The usual route from <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> to Kosambī was up the 
river (this was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others 
to inflict the higher punishment on <a href="channa.htm" title="c/channa.htm">Channa</a>, Vin.ii.290), though there seems to 
have been a land route passing through <a href="anupiya.htm" title="ay/anupiya.htm">Anupiya</a> and Kosambī to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. (See 
Vin.ii.184f). In the Sutta Nipāta (vv.1010-13) the whole route is given from
<a href="maahissati.htm" title="ma/maahissati.htm">Mahissati</a> to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned 
being <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthi, Setavyā, 
Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.</p>
<p>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s 
park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Pindola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women 
of Udena’s palace on two different occasions (Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; 
J.iv.375). The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapāvana in 
Kosambī (S.v.437). Mahā Kaccāna lived in a woodland near Kosambī after the 
holding of the First Council (PvA.141).</p>
<p>Already in the Buddha’s time there were 
four establishments of the Order in Kosambī — the Kukkutārāma, the Ghositārāma, 
the Pāvārika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens 
of Kosambī, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pāvārika), and the 
Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one 
or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these 
visits are recorded in the books. (Thomas, op. cit., 115, n.2, doubts the 
authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha’s visits to Kosambī, 
holding that these stories are of later invention).</p>
<p>The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season 
at Kosambī, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour 
to Kammāssadamma and was offered in marriage Māgandiyā, daughter of the brahmin 
Māgandiya. The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Māgandiya 
Sutta. Māgandiyā took the Buddha’s refusal as an insult to herself, and, after 
her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, 
and also on Udena’s wife Sāmavatī, who had been the Buddha’s follower. 
(DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).</p>
<p>A great schism once arose among the 
monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having 
committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being 
himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be 
dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a 
rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been 
so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually 
excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was 
reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them 
to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were 
exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the 
quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the 
monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation 
were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle 
their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī 
and, journeying through Bālakalonakāragāma and the Pācīnavamsadaya, retired 
alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of 
both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay 
followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthi, they asked his 
pardon and settled their dispute. (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); 
DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given 
in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he 
found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and 
heretics. But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).</p>
<p>The Commentaries give two reasons for 
the name Kosambī. The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic 
tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambī to a Cedi prince, while the origin 
of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kāsī, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city 
was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once 
occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is (e.g., MA 
i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhā) grew in 
great numbers in and around the city.</p>
<p>Bakkula was the son of a banker in 
Kosambī. (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170). In the Buddha’s time there lived near the ferry 
at Kosambī a powerful Nāga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship’s captain. 
The Nāga was converted by Sāgata, who thereby won great fame. (AA.i.179; but see 
J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatikā). Rujā was 
born in a banker’s family in Kosambī (J.vi.237f). Citta-pandita was also born 
there (J.iv.392). A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.</p>
<p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, 
when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he 
went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in 
the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).</p>
<p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha 
promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).</p>
<p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Samyutta 
Nikāya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate 
that the city was on the Yamunā) as being “Gangāya nadiyā tīre.” This is either 
an error, or here the name Gangā refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamunī. 
Kosambī is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety 
miles west of Allahabad. (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, 
J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).</p>
