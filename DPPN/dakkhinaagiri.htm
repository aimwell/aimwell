<p><b>Dakkhināgiri (v.l. Dakkhinagiri)</b></p>
<p>A janapada (district) in India, the 
capital of which was Ujjeni, and over which Asoka ruled as Viceroy. It also 
contained the city of Vedisā (Sp.i.70; Mhv.xiii.5).</p>
<p>Dakkhināgiri lay to the south of 
Rājagaha, beyond the hills that surrounded the city — hence its name (SNA.i.136; 
MA.ii.795; SA.i.188). In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanālā (SN., 
p.13). The road from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha lay through 
Dakkhināgiri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours 
through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhināgiri-vihāra in Ekanālā (S.i.172; 
SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80). It was during one of these tours that he converted 
Kasī-Bhāradvāja and Dhammasava (q.v.) and his father. On another of these 
occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing 
the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287). Ānanda is also said to have 
travelled through Dakkhināgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the 
Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their 
intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ānanda the censure of Mahā Kassapa (S.ii.217f). 
Later, we find Punna with a large following in Dakkhināgiri refusing to join in 
the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma 
according to his own lights (Vin.ii.289).</p>
<p>Dakkhināgiri was the residence of 
Nandamātā of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna 
during a tour in the district (A.iv.64). In Dakkhināgiri, Sāriputta heard of the 
lack of zeal of Dhānañjāni (M.ii.185; see J.i.224 for another incident connected 
with Sāriputta’s tour). The Arāmadūsa Jātaka (q.v.) was preached in Dakkhināgiri.</p>
<p>The Dakkhināgiri-vihāra was, for a long 
time, a great monastic centre, and at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa there 
were present from there forty thousand monks led by Mahā Sangharakkhita.

<p><b>2. Dakkhināgiri-vihāra</b>.-A 
monastery built by Saddhātissa in Ceylon (Mhv.xxxiii.7). It was restored by 
Dhātusena (Cv.xxxviii.46), and Kassapa V. granted a village for its maintenance 
(Cv.lii.60). It is probably identical with the Dakkhināgiridalha-vihāra, in 
which Aggabodhi I. erected an assembly-hall (Cv.xlii.27). It has sometimes been 
identified with the present Mulkirigala-vihāra (Cv.Trs.i.33, n.3).</p>
<p>It was once the residence of 
Appihā-Sāmanera (MT.552) and of Kāla Buddharakkhita (MA.i.469).</p>
