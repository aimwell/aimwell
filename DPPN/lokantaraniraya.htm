<p>A series of hells, each one being bound by three 
cakkavālas. (Cp. Sp.i.120; SNA.ii.443). </p>
<p>Each hell is eight thousand leagues in extent. Beings are 
born there as a result of heinous crimes, “like those of Coranāga, or Corābhaya, 
both of Tambannidīpa.” Their bodies are three gāvutas in height and with their 
long nails they cling to the cakkavālapabbata. Sometimes they fall into the 
world bearing water (lokasandhārakaudaka) and are dried up because of its great 
salinity (AA.ii.532). Elsewhere (NidA.8; SNA.i.59) they are said to suffer from 
extreme cold. Those holding wrong views are also born there (J.vi.247). 
</p>
<p>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA., p. 26), 
Lokantara is the hell of the Asurakāyā.</p>
