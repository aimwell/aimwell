  <h2>Asura</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In Pali Literature the Asuras are 
classed among the inferior deities together with the </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>supannas, </li>
  <li>
  <p>gandhabbas, </li>
  <li>
  <p>yakkhas (DA.i.51), </li>
  <li>
  <p>garulas and </li>
  <li>
  <p>nāgas (Mil.117). </li>
</ul>
<p>Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one 
of the four unhappy rebirths or evil states (apāyā), the others being niraya, 
tiracchānayoni and pettivisaya (E.g., It.93; J.vi.595; J.v.186; Pv.iv.11).
</p>
<p>The fight between the Devas and the 
Asuras is mentioned even in the oldest books of the Tipitaka and is described in 
identical words in several passages (E.g., D.ii.285; S.i.222; iv.201ff; v.447; 
M.i.253; A.iv.432; also S.i.216ff). </p>
<p>A chief or king of the Asuras is often 
referred to as Asurinda (*), several Asuras being credited with the role of 
leader, most commonly, however, Vepacitti (E.g., S.i.222; iv.201ff; J.i.205) and 
Rahu (A.ii.17, 53; iii.243). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*) <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> was also called Asurinda and 
  Asurādhipa; see, e.g., J.i.66 (Asurindena pavitthadevanagaram viya) and 
  J.v.245, where we are told that from the time he conquered the Asuras he was 
  called Asurādhipa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides these we find Pahārāda 
(A.iv.197, 200) (v.l. Mahābhadda), Sambara (S.i.227), Verocana (S.i.225; 
probably another name for Rāhu, see DA.ii.689), Bali (D.ii.259), Sucitti 
(D.ii.269) and Namucī (D.ii.269).</p>
<p>The Asuras are spoken of as dwelling in 
the ocean after having been conquered by Vajira-hattha (Indra, elsewhere, 
[J.v.139] called Asurappamaddana) and are called Vāsava’s brethren, of wondrous 
powers and of great glory. They were present at the preaching of the Mahā Samaya 
Sutta (see DA.ii.689). Buddhaghosa says that they were all descendants of an 
Asura maiden named Sujātā. This cannot be the Sujātā, Vepacitti’s daughter, whom 
Sakka married (J.i.205-6). See also Dānavā.</p>
<p>There were evidently several classes of 
Asuras, and two are mentioned in the Pitakas, the Kālakañjakas and the 
Dānaveghasas. The Dānaveghasas carried bows in their hands. The Kālakañjakas 
were of fearsome shape (D.ii.259), and were considered the lowest among the 
Asuras (D.iii.7; see also Kālañkajaka and Vepacitti).</p>
<p>Once the Asuras dwelt in Tāvatimsa 
together with the devas. When Magha Mānavaka was born as Sakka, he did not 
relish the idea of sharing a kingdom with others, and having made the Asuras 
drunken, he had them hurled by their feet on to the steeps of Sineru. There they 
tumbled into what came to be known as the Asurabhanava, on the lowest level of 
Sineru, equal in extent to Tāvatimsa. Here grew the Cittapātalī tree, and when 
it blossomed the Asuras knew they were no longer in the deva-world. </p>
<p>Wishing to regain their kingdom, they 
climbed Sineru, “like ants going up a pillar.” When the alarm was given, Sakka 
went out to give battle to them in the ocean, but being worsted in the fight, he 
fled in his Vejayantaratha. Fearing that his chariot hurt the young Garulas, he 
had it turned back. The Asuras, thinking that Sakka had obtained reinforcements, 
turned and fled right into the Asurabhavana. Sakka went back to his city and in 
that moment of victory, the Vejayantapāsāda sprang up from the ground. To 
prevent the Asuras from coming back again, Sakka set up as guard in five places 
Nāgas, Garulas, Kumbhandas, Yakkhas and the Four Great Kings. Everywhere were 
images of Indra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand. (J.i.202-4; DhA.i.272-80; 
the same story, differing slightly in details, is found in SnA.484-5). There it 
is said that when Sakka was born among them, the Asuras received him with great 
cordiality; see also the various incidents of the Asura war mentioned in the 
Samyutta Nikāya I. 216ff.</p>
<p>The Asuras are sometimes called 
Pubbadevā (SnA.484) and their kingdom is 10,000 leagues in extent. SnA.485; 
elsewhere, in the same page, it is given as 100,000 leagues.</p>
<p>In Buddhaghosa’s time, the bygone lustre 
of the word Asura (as equivalent to Ahura) seems to have faded. His explanation 
(SA.i.260) of the name is interesting. When Sakka was born with his followers in 
the Asura-world (which later became Tāvatimsa) the Asuras prepared a drink 
called gandapāna. Sakka warned his companions not to drink it, but the Asuras 
became drunk and were thrown down Sineru. Halfway down they regained 
consciousness and made a vow never to drink intoxicants (surd) again; hence 
their name Asura.</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (ii.526) 
defines Asura as bībhaccha, awful, vile. They had a drum called Ālambara (q.v.), 
made of a crab’s claw. They left it behind in their flight from Sakka, and since 
then Sakka has the use of it (J.ii.344).</p>
<p>A story is told by the Buddha (S.2, 
v.446) of a man who once saw a whole army with its four divisions enter a lotus 
stalk and the man thought he was mad. But the Buddha says that it was an Asura 
army in flight. Here the Asuras would seem to be fairies or nature spirits.</p>
