<p>A cetiya in Ceylon, erected, according to tradition, by 
Devānampiyatissa (Codrington, op. cit., 28), on a spot consecrated by the Buddha 
on his third visit to Ceylon (Sp.i.89). It was restored by Jetthatissa. It is, 
perhaps, the monastery attached to this cetiya that is mentioned in the Majjhima 
Commentary (MA.ii.1024) as Mutingana. Maliyadeva Thera preached there the Cha 
Cakka Sutta and sixty monks became arahants.</p>
