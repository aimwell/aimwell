<p><b>1. Suppabuddha.</b> A <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> prince, son of 
<a href="anjana.htm" title="ay/anjana.htm">Añjana</a> and 
<a href="yasodharaa.htm" title="y/yasodharaa.htm">Yasodharā</a>.  </p>
<p>He had a brother, <a href="dandapaanii.htm" title="d/dandapaanii.htm">Dandapāni</a>, and two sisters, 
<a href="mahamaayaa.htm" title="maha/mahamaayaa.htm">Māyā</a> and 
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Pajāpatī</a>. </p>
<p>He 
married <a href="amitaa.htm" title="am/amitaa.htm">Amitā</a> and had two children, 
<a href="bhaddakaccaanaa.htm" title="b/bhaddakaccaanaa.htm">Bhaddakaccānā</a> and 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>. Thus he was 
father in law to the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (Mhv.ii.19, 21; but see also Añjana). It is said 
(DhA.iii.44f.; cf. Mil.301) that he was offended with the Buddha for deserting 
his daughter and for being hostile to Devadatta. One day he took strong drink 
and blocked the Buddha’s path, refusing to move in spite of the repeated 
requests of the monks. The Buddha thereupon turned back. Ānanda seeing the 
Buddha smile and enquiring the reason for the smile, was told that, at the end 
of seven days, Suppabuddha would be swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his 
stairs. Suppabuddha overheard this, and had all his belongings carried to the 
seventh storey of his house. He removed the stairway, closed all doors, and set 
a strong guard. On the seventh day a state charger belonging to Suppabuddha 
broke loose. None could manage him except Suppabuddha, and he, desiring to seize 
the animal, moved towards the door. The doors opened of their own accord, the 
stairway returned to its place, and the strong guard threw him down the stairs. 
When he landed at the bottom of the stairway the earth opened and swallowed him 
up in Avīci. He was also evidently called Mahāsuppabuddha. E.g., ThigA.140.</p>

<p><b>2. Suppabuddha.</b> A poor leper of Rājagaha, who, one 
day seated in the outer circle of people, heard the Buddha preach and became a 
sotāpanna. While waiting the departure of the crowd so that he could pay homage 
to the Buddha and express his gratitude, Sakka, desiring to test him, approached 
him and offered him untold wealth if he would repudiate the Buddha, his 
teachings, and the Order. But although Sakka revealed his identity, Suppabuddha 
rebuked him for a fool and said he had no need of more wealth, because he 
possessed already the seven stores of Ariyadhana (Noble Wealth). Sakka reported 
this conversation to the Buddha, who said that no power in the world would 
change Suppabuddha. Soon after, Suppabuddha visited the Buddha, and, having 
worshipped him, was on his way to the city when he was gored to death by a cow, 
the cow which killed also <a href="pukkusati.htm" title="pu/pukkusati.htm">Pukkusāti</a>, <a href="baahiya.htm" title="b/baahiya.htm">Bāhiya Dāruciriya</a> and 
<a href="tambadaathika.htm" title="t/tambadaathika.htm">Tambadāthika</a>.</p>
<p>The cow was a Yakkhinī, who had once been a courtesan. 
These four men had then been sons of wealthy merchants, who, having taken her 
one day to a pleasure garden, took their pleasure with her. In the evening they 
killed her and took the jewels and money which they themselves had given her. At 
the moment of her death she had vowed vengeance on them and had killed them in 
one hundred existences.  </p>
<p>In a previous birth, Suppabuddha had insulted the 
Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhī by calling him a “leper” (kutthi) — because 
he wore a patched robe — and by spitting on him. </p>
<p>Ud.v.3; UdA.279ff.; DhA.ii.33f. The Udāna account does not include the 
interlude of Sakka.</p>

<p><b>3. Suppabuddha. </b>Son of <a href="vessabhuu.htm" title="vy/vessabhuu.htm">Vessabhū</a> Buddha in his last 
lay life. D.ii.7; Bu.xxii.20.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Suppabuddha.</b> A king of fifty seven kappas ago, a 
former birth of Eraka (Maggadāyaka) Thera. ThagA.i.193; Ap.i.173.</p>
