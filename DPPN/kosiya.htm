<p><b>1. Kosiya, Kosiyagotta</b></p>
<p>The name of a brahmin clan. In the Pācittiya it is given as one of the lower gottas. 
(Vin.iv.8; but it is also Sakka’s gotta, and is therefore generally regarded as 
a high one; see e.g., Thag.415; ThagA.i.452).  </p>
<p>Among those mentioned as belonging 
to this gotta are the brahmin Kevatta (J.vi.418f), the brahmin who was the 
father of Sona Kumāra (the Bodhisatta) (J.v.319ff), Bhaddākāpilāni, born in 
Sāgala (AA.i.99; ThagA.68; SA ii.144), and the banker who came to be known as 
Macchariya-Kosiya (q.v.).  </p>
<p>Kātiyāna’s father was a Kosiyan, but he married a 
woman of the Kātiyāna family (ThagA.i.452).</p>
<p>The <a href="bhuridatta_jat_543.htm" title="b/bhuridatta_jat_543.htm">Bhūridatta Jātaka</a> (J.vi.181; 
Mtu.ii.49) mentions a sage Kosiya, who taught Alambāyana the Nāga-spell. The 
scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.  </p>
<p>The <a href="salikedara_jat484.htm" title="sa/salikedara_jat484.htm">Sālikedāra Jātaka</a> (J.iv.278f) 
mentions a brahmin of Sālindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same 
reason.  </p>
<p>The <a href="kosiya_jat_130_226_470.htm" title="ku/kosiya_jat_130_226_470.htm">Kosiya Jātaka</a> (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-brāhmanī. All these are 
either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts. The name 
Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka — once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), 
once by Mahā Moggallāna (M.i.252) — and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahā 
Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).  </p>
<p>The name means “belonging to the Kusika 
family.” It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not 
known. Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, 
315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only 
the god of a Kusika clan.</p>
<p>The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means 
“Owl” and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of 
animals (cf. Vaccha).</p>

<p><b>2. Kosiya</b>.-See Macchari-Kosiya.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Kosiya Thera</b>.-An arahant. He belonged 
to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name. He often 
listened to the preaching of Sāriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won 
arahant ship. He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatī and in the time of Vipassī 
Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane. (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).  </p>
<p>He 
is probably identical with Ucchukandika of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.393.</p>
