<p>Inhabitants of the fifth of the nine 
abodes of beings (sattāvāsā). These beings are unconscious and experience 
nothing (A.iv.401). As soon as an idea occurs to them they fall from their state 
(D.i.28). Brahmin ascetics, having practised continual meditation and attained 
to the fourth jhāna, seeing the disadvantages attached to thinking, try to do 
away with it altogether. Dying in this condition, they are reborn among the 
Asaññasattā, having form only, but neither sensations, ideas, predispositions 
nor consciousness. They last only as long as their power of jhāna; then an idea 
occurs to them and they die straightaway (DA.i.118).</p>
<p>The Andhakas held that these devas were 
really only sometimes conscious, which belief the Theravādins rejected as being 
absurd (Kvu.262).</p>
<p>The Elder Sobhita was once born among 
the Asaññasattā and could remember that existence. These devas are long-lived.
