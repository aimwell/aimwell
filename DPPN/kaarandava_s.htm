  <h2>Kārandava Sutta</h2>

<p>Once, while the Buddha was at Campā on 
the banks of the Gaggarā Lake, a monk, charged by his colleagues with an 
offence, reviled them; the Buddha, hearing of it, insisted that the man should 
be expelled, lest the rest of the community should suffer by his presence. He 
illustrated his argument with various similes, among them that of the owner of a 
barley-field who, seeing among his corn a diseased plant (yava-kārandava) which 
failed to ripen, would uproot it and throw it away lest the other plants should 
be affected. A.iv.168-72.</p>
