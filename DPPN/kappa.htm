<p><b>1. Kappa.</b>-One of <a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī’s</a> disciples. The 
questions he asked of the Buddha are recorded in the Kappamānavapucchā (q.v.). 
He became an arahant. Sn.vv.1007, 1092-5; SnA.ii.597.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Kappa Thera.</b>-An arahant. He was the 
son of a provincial governor in Magadha and was addicted to self-indulgence. The 
Buddha, seeing him in his net of wisdom, visited him and admonished him, 
speaking to him of the filthy nature of the body, illustrating his sermon with a 
wealth of simile and metaphor. Kappa was greatly impressed and joined the Order. 
He became an arahant, as his head was being shaved. In the time of the Buddha 
Siddhattha he was a rich householder, and offered at the Buddha’s shrine a kapparukkha containing objects of great value. Wherever he was born celestial 
trees grew outside his door. Seven kappas ago he was eight times king under the 
name of Sucela (Thag.567-76; ThagA.i.521ff). He is probably identical with 
Kapparukkhiya of the Apadāna. Ap.i.91.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Kappa.</b>-In the Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.iii.169f) two suttas are connected with a monk called Kappa, who is probably 
identical with Kappa (2). In both suttas he asks the Buddha how it is possible 
to cultivate knowledge and thought so as to be free from thoughts of “I” and 
“mine” with regard to the body. The same questions, receiving the same answers, 
are elsewhere attributed to Rāhula. S.ii.253f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Kappa.</b>-A young brahmin (Kappakamāra) 
who was the Bodhisatta. He later became a sage and the disciple and friend of 
Kesava. For his story see the <a href="kesava_jat_346.htm" title="ku/kesava_jat_346.htm">Kesava Jātaka</a> (J.iii.142ff). The story is also 
referred to in the <a href="bakabrahma_jat_405.htm" title="b/bakabrahma_jat_405.htm">Bakabrahma Jātaka</a> (J.iii.361; DhA.i.342f), and mentioned in 
the Samyutta Nikaya (S.i.144; SA.i.164; MA.i.555), where Bakabrahma is 
identified with Kappa’s teacher, Kesava. v.l. Kappaka.</p>
