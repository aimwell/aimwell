<p>Kalārakhattiya tells Sāriputta of 
Moliya-Phagguna’s secession. Sāriputta says that Moliya-Phagguna did not find 
satisfaction in the Dhamma, and assures Kalāra that he himself has no doubts 
whatever either about the past or about the future. Kalāra reports this 
conversation to the Buddha, who sends for Sāriputta and asks him a series of 
questions. The Buddha praises his answers, but Sāriputta confesses to his 
colleagues later that he felt nervous over the first question, but when the 
Buddha accepted his answer to that he recovered his confidence. S.ii.50ff.</p>
