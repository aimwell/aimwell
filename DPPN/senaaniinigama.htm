<p>The village in which <a href="s6_siy.htm#Senani" title="s/s6_siy.htm#Senani">Senānī</a> lived. It was the residence 
also of his daughter <a href="sujaataa.htm" title="s/sujaataa.htm">Sujātā</a>, who gave milk-rice to the Buddha. It was near 
<a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a> and on the banks of the
<a href="neranjara.htm" title="n/neranjara.htm">Nerañjarā</a> (J.i.68).  </p>
<p>The name seems originally to 
have been Senānigama (E.g., S.i.106; Vin.i.21; M.i.166, 240).  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa 
himself does not seem to have been sure of the spelling. He says (SA.i.135) it 
was so called because it was occupied by soldiers at the beginning of the kappa 
(pathamakappikānam senāya nivitthokāse patitthitagāmo) or because it was the 
village of Sujātā’s father Senānī (Sujātāya vā pitu Senānī nāma nigamo).  </p>
<p>The Lalitavistara (p.311, [248]) calls it Senāpatigrāma.</p>
