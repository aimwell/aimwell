  <h2>Abhibhūta</h2>

</ul>
<p>A Thera. He was born in the Rājā’s 
family in Vettha (v.l. Vetthipura) and succeeded to his father’s estate. When 
the Buddha came to the city during a tour, Abhibhūta heard him and invited him 
for a meal; he later entered the Order and became an arahant. </p>
<p>Three verses ascribed to Abhibhūta occur 
in the Theragāthā, uttered, it is said, when his kinsmen and retainers came to 
him lamenting that he had left them without a leader (Thag.vv.255-7; 
ThagA.i.372f). The second of these verses is elsewhere (S.i.156) attributed to 
Abhibhū, chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha. But in the Milindapañha (245), Nāgasena 
ascribes the second verse to the Buddha, and in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta 
(D.ii.121) the third verse also is ascribed to him. The second verse is also 
assigned to the Buddha in the Divyāvadāna (p.200), but elsewhere in the same 
books (p.569) it is said to have been uttered by devas.</p>
<p>In a former birth Abhibhūta had been a 
householder in the time of Vessabhū Buddha and became a believer in the Faith, 
to which he was led by his friends. When the Buddha died, the populace gathered 
together to obtain relics, but Abhibhūta, having quenched the pyre with fragrant 
water, was first able to take those which he desired (ThagA.i.372).</p>
<p>He is evidently to be identified with 
Citakanibbāpaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.408).</p>
