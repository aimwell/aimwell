<p>Brother of the courtesan Kālī. He was a 
ne'er-do-well, and Kālī, having helped him with money which he proceeded to 
squander, refused to give him any more. But a patron of Kālī, seeing his 
condition, gave him his clothes on entering Kālī’s house — it being the custom 
for those who patronised a courtesan, to be provided with clothes during their 
stay in her house — and had to walk away naked. J.iv.248f.</p>
