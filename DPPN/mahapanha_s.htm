<h2>1. Mahāpañha Sutta</h2>
<p>A series of questions and answers forming an epitome of 
the Buddha’s teachings; each question contains one statement (uddesa) and one 
exposition (veyyākarana), and so on, up to ten, which consists of ten subjects (dasa 
akusalakammapathā) put in one group (A.v.48ff). It is probably this sutta which 
is referred to as the Mahāpañhā in the Anguttara Nikāya. A.v.54.</p>

<h2>2. Mahāpañha Sutta</h2>
<p>A number of lay devotees of Kajañgalā visit the Kajañgalā 
bhikkhunī (q.v.) and ask her to explain in detail the Mahāpañhā as stated by the 
Buddha. She answers that she has heard neither the explanation of the Buddha nor 
that of the arahants, but she will explain them according to her own lights, and 
proceeds to do so. The devotees report her explanation to the Buddha, who 
praises her wisdom and declares that his own explanation would have been 
identical. A.v.54ff.</p>
