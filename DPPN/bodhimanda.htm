<p>The name given to the spot under the Bodhi tree where the 
Buddha attained Enlightenment and where he sat for one week after the 
Enlightenment (Vin.i.1; but according to DhA.i.71 he spent seven weeks there).
</p>
<p>A monastery was later erected there called the <b>Bodhimanda</b><span lang="en-us"><b>-vihāra</b>. 
</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">Thirty thousand monks, under Cittagutta, came from there to the foundation 
ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.41). It was near here that Buddhaghosa was 
born (Cv.xxxvii.215), and here Silākāla entered the Order (Cv.xxxix.47). </span></p>
