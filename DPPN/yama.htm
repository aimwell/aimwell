  <h2>Yama</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The god of death. (See, e.g., 
DhA.iii.337; Yamassa santikam = Maranasantikam).  </p>
<p>When 
beings die they are led before him to be judged according to their deeds. Birth, 
old age, illness, punishment for crime and death, are regarded as his 
messengers, sent among men as a warning to abstain from ill and do good. Yama 
questions beings brought before him as to whether they have seen these 
messengers and profited by them. If the answer is in the negative, the 
nirayapālas take them away to the different hells (M.iii.179ff).  </p>
<p>In the <a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya Sutta</a> (D.ii.259) mention is made of two Yamas (duve Yamā), which the 
Commentary explains (DA.ii.690) by “dve Yamakadevatā” (the twins, whom Rhys 
Davids calls the Castor and Pollux of Indian Mythology, in Dial.ii.290, n.1). 
Elsewhere (AA.i.374; MA.ii.953) Buddhaghosa speaks of four Yamas (im c' esa eko 
va hoti, catusu pana dvāresu cattāro janā honti) at the four gates (of the 
Nirayas?). He says that Yama is a Vemānikapetarājā, who sometimes enjoys all the 
pleasures of heaven, in a celestial mansion, surrounded by kapparukkhas, and at 
other times experiences the fruits of his kamma. He is a good king.</p>
<p>In the Jātakas* the Nirayas are particularly mentioned as 
Yama’s abode (Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasādana, etc.); but, more generally, 
all Samsāra is considered as subject to Yama’s rule, and escape from samsāra 
means escape from Yama’s influence, Yama being the god of Death. It is evidently 
in this sense that Yama is called Vesāyi (q.v.) (J.ii.317, 318). Yama is 
sometimes mentioned** with <a href="inda.htm" title="i_/inda.htm">Indra</a>, 
<a href="varuna.htm" title="va/varuna.htm">Varuna</a>, <a href="soma.htm" title="s/soma.htm">Soma</a>,
<a href="pajapati.htm" title="pa/pajapati.htm">Pajāpati</a>, etc., as a god to whom 
sacrifices are offered. There is a tradition (A.i.142) that once Yama longed to 
be born as a human being and to sit at the feet of a Tathāgata.</p>
<p>Yama’s Nayanāyudha is mentioned (SNA.i.225) among the most 
destructive of weapons.</p>
<hr>
<p>* E.g., J.ii.318; iv.273; v.268, 274, 304. The Vetaranī is 
mentioned as forming the boundary of Yama’s kingdom (i.21; J.ii.317; iii.472; 
but see ii.318). At J.iv.405, Yama’s abode is called Ussadaniraya. DhA.i.334 
explains Yamaloka by Catubbidham apāyalokam. Cp. PvA.33 (Yamaloko ti petaloko); 
ibid., 107 (Yamavisayam = Petalokam).</p>
<p>** E.g., J.vi.201; D.i.244; at Mil.37 the list includes 
Kuvera, Suyāma and Santusita; cp. Mtu i.265; iii.68, 77; 77, 307.</p>
