</ul>
<p>One of Bāvarī’s disciples. His question 
and the Buddha’s answer are found in the Jatukanni Sutta (SN.vv.1007, 1096-1100; 
Dvy.635).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, 
Jatukannī was a banker in Hamsavatī, rich enough to lend money even to the king, 
Arindama. One day he saw the Buddha going along the street and, having invited 
him and twenty thousand monks, gave them a meal at his house. Ap.ii.357ff.</p>
