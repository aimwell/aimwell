<p>A lotus pond near Rājagaha. </p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikaya mentions the Buddha as relating the 
story of a man who went to Sumāgadhā with the thought, “I will speculate about 
the world.” He saw an army, with its four divisions, enter a lotus stalk. He 
then thought he must be mad and told everyone so. The Buddha explained that what 
the man had seen was real; it was an Asura army, fleeing from the devas in 
panic, through a lotus stalk (S.v.447f.; cf. Rāmāyana i.34). </p>
<p>Near the pond was the Moranivāpa, and within walking 
distance was the Paribbājakārāma in Queen Udumbarikā’s park. The Buddha was 
walking about in the open air near Sumāgadhā, just before he preached the 
Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta. D.iii.40.</p>
