<p><b>1. Anabhirati Jātaka (No. 65).</b>-Women 
cannot be regarded as private property. They are common to all; they extend 
universal hospitality.</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a famous teacher 
of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. A pupil of his, finding his wife unfaithful, was so affected by the 
discovery that he kept away from classes. When asked why, he told his teacher 
the whole story; the latter consoled him by telling him that all women were 
unfaithful.</p>
<p>The story was told to an upāsaka who 
came to visit the Buddha. Once, on discovering his wife’s faithlessness, he had 
words with her and kept away from the vihāra. J.i.301-2; see also 
DhA.iii.348ff., where the details given are slightly different.</p>

<p><b>2. Anabhirati Jātaka (No. 185).</b>-Told to 
a young brahmin of Sāvatthi who knew the three Vedas by heart. When he married 
his mind became darkened. He visited the Buddha, who talked to him pleasantly 
and discovered in the course of conversation that his memory had grown weak. The 
same thing had happened to him in the past, said the Buddha. Serenity of mind is 
essential for good memory. J.ii.99-101.</p>
