  <h2>Mitacintī Jātaka (No. 114)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There were once three fishes&nbsp;&nbsp; Bahucintī, 
Appacintī and Mitacintī — who, one day, left their haunts and came to where men 
dwelt. Mitacintī (the Bodhisatta) saw the danger and warned the others, but they 
would not listen and were caught in a net. Then Mitacintī splashed about and 
deceived the fishermen into thinking that the other two had escaped. They 
thereupon raised the net by one single corner and the other two escaped.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to two aged monks who 
spent the rainy season in the forest, wishing to go to the Buddha. But they 
constantly postponed their visit and it was not till three months after the end 
of the rains that they finally arrived at Jetavana. The two monks are identified 
with the thoughtless fish. J.i.426-8.</p>
