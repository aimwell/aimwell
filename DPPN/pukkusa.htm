<h4>1. Pukkusa</h4>
<p>A counsellor of Maddava, king of Benares. For details see 
the Dasannaka Jātaka. Pukkusa is identified with Sāriputta. J.iii.341.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pukkusa</h4>
<p>One of the four ministers of Vedeha, king of Mithilā. He 
joined with his three companions in a conspiracy against Mahosadha, stealing a 
golden necklace from the king’s palace in order to try and implicate Mahosadha. 
The details are given in the Mahāummagga Jātaka (J.vi.330ff). On Pukkusa’s thigh 
was a leprous spot, which he hid from the king because the king loved to lay his 
head on Pukkusa’s lap. Only his younger brother knew of this secret; but it was 
discovered later by Mahosadha, and Pukkusa was sent to prison. Pukkusa is 
identified with Potthāpāda. Ibid., 478.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Pukkusa</h4>
<p>A Mallarājaputta. He was a disciple of Alāra Kālama, and 
one day, while on his way from Kusinārā to Pāvā, he saw the Buddha seated under 
a tree by the roadside and stayed to talk to him. He mentioned that once five 
hundred carts had passed by where Ālāra sat, and yet so deep was he in 
meditation that he had failed to notice them. The Buddha told him how, when he 
himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which 
killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so 
deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, 
and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two 
robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha’s suggestion, he handed to 
Ānanda. When Pukkusa had left, Ānanda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was 
greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of 
the Buddha’s body (D.ii.130ff). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.569) that Pukkusa was a merchant, 
and was the owner of the five hundred carts which had crossed the Kakkutthā 
(q.v.) shortly before the incident above mentioned.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Pukkusa</h4>
<p>The name of a caste, classified among the despised castes 
(E.g., A.ii.85; M.ii.152). The Commentary explains (E.g., AA.ii.523) them as 
“those who sweep up flowers which are offered at shrines and are not removed by 
the devotees who have given them.” The word Pukkusa was evidently not despised 
as a personal name because, in the case of Pukkusa (3), for instance, the person 
bearing the name was a khattiya.</p>
