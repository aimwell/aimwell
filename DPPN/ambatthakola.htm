<p>A district in Ceylon near the modern 
Kurunegala, fifty-five miles from Anurādhapura. When Dutthagāmani planned to 
build the Mahā Thūpa silver appeared near a cave in this district by the power 
of the devas and was discovered by a merchant who reported the find to the king; 
the king himself came to gather the silver for the thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.20-35; 
MT.512).</p>
<p>Later, Ānanda gāmani Abhaya built the 
Rajatalena Vihāra here (Mhv.xxxv.4, 5). It was in this district, in the 
neighbourhood of the Kuthāri Vihāra, that Moggallāna defeated his brother the 
parricide Kassapa I. (Cv.xxxix.21ff)</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā it was 
in Ambatthakola that King Mahācūlī Mahātissa worked in Sonnagiri in a sugar mill 
to earn money for an alms-giving (MT.624; Mhv.xxxiv.4f ) (v.l. Ambatthakolalena).</p>
