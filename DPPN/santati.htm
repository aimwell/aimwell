<p>A minister of Pasenadi. Because he quelled a frontier 
disturbance, the king gave over the kingdom to him for seven days, and gave him 
a woman skilled in song and dance. For seven days Santati enjoyed himself, 
drinking deeply; on the seventh day he went to the bathing place fully adorned, 
riding the state elephant. The Buddha met him on the way, and Santati saluted 
him from the elephant. The Buddha smiled and passed on. When questioned by 
Ānanda, the Buddha answered that on that very day Santati would attain 
arahantship and die.</p>
<p>Santati spent part of the day amusing himself in the 
water, and then sat in the drinking hall of the park. The woman came on the 
stage and sang and danced, but she had fasted for seven days to acquire more 
grace of body, and, as she danced, she fell down dead. Santati was overwhelmed 
with a mighty sorrow, and straightway became sober. He then sought the Buddha 
for consolation in his grief. The Buddha preached a four line stanza, and 
Santati attained arahantship and asked the Buddha’s permission to pass into 
nibbāna. The Buddha agreed, on condition that he rose into the air and told to 
the assembled people the story of his past life. Santati agreed to this, and, 
rising to a height of seven palm trees, related the meritorious deed of his past 
life.</p>
<p>Ninety kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a 
householder of Bandhumatī, and became a follower of the Buddha and went about 
proclaiming the virtues of the Three Refuges. King Bandhumā met him and gave him 
a garland of flowers to wear and a horse on which to ride, while proclaiming the 
Law. He later gave him a chariot, great wealth, beautiful jewels and an 
elephant. Thus, for eighty four thousand years, Santati went about preaching the 
Dhamma, and there was diffused from his body the fragrance of sandalwood, and 
from his mouth the fragrance of the lotus.</p>
<p>As he related his story, seated cross legged in the air, 
he developed the idea of fire and passed into nibbāna. Flames burst from his 
body and burnt it up. The Buddha had his relics collected and a shrine built for 
them at the meeting of four highways. Discussion arose as to whether Santati 
should be called a brahmin or a monk. The Buddha said that both names were 
equally appropriate. DhA.iii.78 84; SN.i.350; MA.i.188; cf. the story of 
Abhayarājakumāra.</p>
