  <h2>1. Mahāpāli. </h2>

<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahāpāli.</b> A refectory built by Devānampiyatissa Anurādhapura, for 
the use of the monks (Mhv.xx.23). Various kings provided special food to be 
distributed there — e.g., Upatissa II., who sent 
food prepared for him in the palace (Cv.xxxvii.181; so did King Silākāla, 
Cv.xli.28), and himself ate of the food left over after the distribution 
(Cv.xxxvii.203).</p>
<p>Mahānāma enlarged the building (Cv.xxxvii.211), as did 
Silāmeghavana (Cv.xliv.65) and Udaya II (Cv.li.132).</p>
<p>Dhātusena instituted distribution of rice (Cv.xxxviii.41), 
while Aggabodhi II. added to the hall and set up a stone canoe (bhattanāvam) for 
the distribution of rice (Cv.xlii.67; Aggabodhi I. had already given a canoe of 
bronze, Cv.xlii.33).</p>
<p>After his victory, Kassapa II., by way of celebration, 
held a special almsgiving at the Mahāpāli (Cv.xlv.1). Dāthopatissa II. 
distributed there clothing, rice, sour milk, milk and milk rice on uposatha days 
(Cv.xlv.25). Mahinda I. gave ten cartloads of food (Cv.xlviii.34), and Aggabodhi 
IX. distributed daily an amount of rice equal in weight to his own body 
(Cv.lxix.78). The Coliyans burnt down the building, and the last we hear of it 
is its restoration by Mahinda IV. (Cv.liv.45).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahāpāli.</b> A monastic building, probably a 
  refectory, built by Aggabodhi, son of Mahātissa, at Mahāgāma. Cv.xlv.42.</p>
