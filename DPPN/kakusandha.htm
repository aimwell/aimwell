  <h2>Kakusandha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The twenty-second of the twenty-four 
Buddhas and the first of the five Buddhas of the present Bhaddakappa.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>He was the 
son of the brahmin Aggidatta, chaplain of Khemankara, king of Khemavatī, and 
Visākhā.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He was born in the Khema pleasaunce, and lived for four thousand years 
in the household in three palaces — Ruci, Suruci and Vaddhana (or Rativaddhana). 
 
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>His wife was Virocamānā (or Rocanī), and he had a son, Uttara.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He left the world 
riding in a chariot, and practised austerities for only eight months.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Before his 
Enlightenment, he was given a meal of milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin 
Vajirindha of the village Sucirindha, and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka 
Subhadda.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>His bodhi was a Sirīsa-tree, and his first sermon was preached to 
eighty-four thousand monks in the park near the city of Makila.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He performed the 
Twin-Miracle under a Sāla-tree at the gates of Kannakujja. Among his converts 
was a fierce yakkha named Naradeva.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He held only one assembly of his monks. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Kakusandha’s body was forty cubits in height, and he died at the age of forty 
thousand years in the Khema pleasaunce. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The thūpa erected over his relics was 
one league high.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was at that time a king 
named Khema. The Buddha’s chief disciples were Vidhura and Sañjīva among monks, 
and Sama and Campā among nuns. His personal attendant was Buddhija. Accuta and 
Samana, Nandā and Sunandā were his most eminent lay-supporters (D.ii.7; Bu.xxiii; 
J.i.42; BuA.209ff). Kakusandha kept the fast-day (uposatha) every year 
(DhA.iii.236). In Kakusandha’s time a Māra, named Dūsī (a previous birth of 
Moggallāna), gave a great deal of trouble to the Buddha and his followers, 
trying greatly the Buddha’s patience (M.i.333ff; Thag.1187). The Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.ii.190f) mentions that during the time of Kakusandha, the Mount Vepulla of 
Rājagaha was named Pācīna-vamsa and the inhabitants were called Tivarā.</p>
<p>The monastery built by Accuta on the 
site where, in the present age, Anāthapindika erected the Jetavanārāma, was half 
a league in extent, and the ground was bought by golden kacchapas sufficient in 
number to cover it (J.i.94).</p>
<p>According to the Ceylonese chronicles 
(Dpv.ii.66; xv.25, 34; xvii.9, 16, etc.; Mhv.xv.57-90), Kakusandha paid a visit 
to Ceylon. The island was then known as Ojadīpa and its capital was Abhayanagara, 
where reigned King Abhaya. The Mahāmeghavana was called Mahātittha. The Buddha 
came, with forty thousand disciples, to rid the island of a pestilence caused by 
yakkhas and stood on the Devakūta mountain from where, by virtue of his own 
desire, all inhabitants of the country could see him. The Buddha and his 
disciples were invited to a meal by the king, and after the meal the Mahātittha 
garden was presented to the Order; there the Buddha sat, in meditation, in order 
to consecrate various spots connected with the religion. At the Buddha’s wish, 
the nun Rucānandā brought to the island a branch of the sacred bodhi-tree. The 
Buddha gave to the people his own drinking-vessel as an object of worship, and 
returned to Jambudīpa, leaving behind his disciples Mahādeva and Rucānandā to 
look after the spiritual welfare of the new converts to the faith.</p>
<p>In Buddhist Sanskrit texts the name of 
the Buddha is given as Krakucchanda (See especially Divy.254, 418f; Mtu.iii.247, 
330).</p>

<p>2. Kakusandha Thera.-Author of the 
Sinhalese Dhātuvamsa, probably a translation from the Pāli. He is generally 
assigned to the fifteenth century. P.L.C.255.</p>
