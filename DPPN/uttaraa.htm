<p><b>1. Uttarā</b>.-A therī. She was born in 
Kapilavatthu in a Sākyan family. She became a lady of the Bodhisatta’s court and 
later renounced the world with Pajāpatī Gotamī. When she was developing insight, 
the Buddha appeared before her to encourage her and she became an arahant. 
Thig.v.15; ThigA.21f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Uttarā.</b>-She was the daughter of a 
clansman’s family in Sāvatthi. Having heard Patācarā preach, she entered the 
Order and became an arahant.</p>
<p>The Therīgāthā contains seven verses 
uttered by her after becoming an arahant, the result of her determination not to 
leave the sitting posture till she had won emancipation. Later she repeated 
these verses to Patācārā. Thig.vv.175-81; ThigA.161-2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Uttarā.</b>-In the Theragāthā two verses 
(Thag.vv.1020-1) are attributed to Ānanda, as having been spoken by him in 
admonition to an upāsikā named Uttarā, who was filled with the idea of her own 
beauty. Some say, however, that these verses were spoken in admonition to those 
who lost their heads at the sight of Ambapāli. ThagA.ii.129.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Uttarā Nandamātā.</b>-Chief of the 
lay-women disciples who waited on the Buddha (Bu.xxvi.20). In the Anguttara 
Nikāya (i.26), she is described as the best of women disciples in meditative 
power (jhāyīnam), but this may refer to another Uttarā. She is again mentioned 
(A.iv.347; AA.ii.791) in a list of eminent lay-women disciples, who observed the 
fast (uposatha) of the eight precepts.</p>
<p>According to the Anguttara Commentary 
(i.240ff), she was the daughter of Punnasīha (Punnaka) (q.v.), a servitor of 
Sumana-setthi of Rājagaha. Later, when Punnasīha was made dhana-setthi because 
of the immense wealth he gained by virtue of a meal given to Sāriputta, he held 
an almsgiving for the Buddha and his monks for seven days. On the seventh day, 
at the end of the Buddha’s sermon of thanksgiving, Punnasīha, his wife and 
daughter, all became Sotāpanna.</p>
<p>When Sumana-setthi asked for Uttarā’s 
hand for his son, his request was refused because Sumana’s family did not belong 
to the Buddha’s faith. Punna sent word to Sumana that Uttarā was the Buddha’s 
disciple and daily offered flowers to the Buddha, costing a kahāpana. Later, 
however, when Sumana promised that Uttarā should be given flowers worth two 
kahāpanas, Punna agreed and Uttarā was married. After several unsuccessful 
attempts to obtain her husband’s permission to keep the fast, as she had done in 
her parents' house, she got from her father fifteen thousand kahāpanas and with 
these she purchased the services of a prostitute named Sirimā, to look after her 
husband for a fortnight, and with his consent she entered on a fortnight’s 
uposatha. On the last day of the fast, while Uttarā was busy preparing alms for 
the Buddha, her husband, walking along with Sirimā, saw her working hard and 
smiled, thinking what a fool she was not to enjoy her wealth. Uttarā, seeing 
him, smiled at the thought of his folly in not making proper use of his wealth. 
Sirimā, thinking that husband and wife were smiling at each other, regardless of 
her presence, flew into a fury and, seizing a pot of boiling oil, threw it at 
Uttarā’s head. But Uttarā was at that time full of compassion for Sirimā, and 
the oil, therefore, did not hurt her at all. Sirimā, realising her grievous 
folly, begged forgiveness of Uttarā, who took her to the Buddha and related the 
whole story, asking that he should forgive her. The Buddha preached to Sirimā 
and she became a Sotāpanna.</p>
<p>The Vimānavatthu Commentary (pp.631ff; 
Vv.11f) and the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.302ff; see also iii.104) give the 
above story with several variations in detail. According to these versions, at 
the end of the Buddha’s sermon to Sirimā, Uttarā became a Sakadāgāmī and her 
husband and father-in-law Sotāpannas.</p>
<p>After death Uttarā was born in Tāvatimsa 
in a vimāna. Moggallāna saw her in one of his visits to Tāvatimsa and, having 
learnt her story, repeated it to the Buddha.</p>
<p>It is curious that Nanda is not 
mentioned in either account. It has been suggested (E.g., Brethren 41, n.1) that 
Uttarā Nandamātā may be identical with Velukantakī-Nanda-mātā, but I do not 
think that the identification is justified. Uttarā’s story is given in the 
Visuddhi-Magga (p.313) to prove that fire cannot burn the body of a person who 
lives in love, and again (p.380-1; also Ps.ii.212; PsA.497), as an instance of 
psychic power being diffused by concentration.</p>
