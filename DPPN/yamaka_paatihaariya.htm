<p>The miracle of the “double appearances”. When the Buddha 
laid down a rule forbidding the exercise of supernatural powers by monks — following on the miracle performed by Pindola Bhāradvāja (q.v.) — the heretics went about 
saying that henceforth they would perform no miracles except with the Buddha. 
Bimbisāra reported this to the Buddha, who at once accepted the challenge, 
explaining that the rule was for his disciples and did not apply to himself. He, 
therefore, went to Sāvatthi, the place where all Buddhas perform the Miracle. In 
reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of 
the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of Asālha. This was in the seventh year 
after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57). </p>
<p>The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one 
league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king’s garden, 
accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvelous tree to sprout from 
its seed. The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and 
they had to flee helter skelter. It was during this flight that Pūrana Kassapa 
(q.v.) committed suicide. The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, 
extended to a distance of thirty six leagues. The Buddha created a jewelled walk 
in the air by the side of the Gandamba. When the Buddha’s disciples knew what 
was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the 
insinuations of the heretics. Among such disciples were Gharanī, Culla 
Anātthapindika, Cīrā, Cunda, Uppalavannā and Moggallāna. </p>
<p>The Buddha refused their offers and related the 
Kanhausabha and Nandivisāla Jātakas. Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he 
proceeded to perform the Yamaka-pātihāriya (Twin 
Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of 
opposite character in pairs — e.g., producing 
flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and 
then alternatively. Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded 
alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left. DA.l.57; 
DhA.iii.214f. explains how this was done. From every pore of his body rays of 
six colors darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahmā and downwards to the 
edge of the Cakkavāla. The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha 
walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time 
to time. It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during 
sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the 
assembly. At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of 
his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to Tāvatimsa, there to preach 
the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.</p>
<p>The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very 
great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff. The DhA. version appears to be 
entirely different from the Jātaka version; the latter is very brief and lacks 
many details, especially regarding Pindola’s miracle and the preaching of the 
Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa. The account given in Dvy. (143-66) 
is again different; the Miracle was evidently repeatedly performed by the Buddha 
(see, e.g., Candanamālā), and it is often referred to — 
e.g., J.i.77, 88, 193; Ps.i.125; SNA.i.36; AA.i.71; MA.ii.962; Mil. 349; 
Vsm.390; PvA.137; Dāthāvamsa i.50. The miracle was also performed by the 
Buddha’s relics; see, .e.g., Mhv.xvii.52f.; Sp.i.88, 92.</p>
<p>It is said (Mil.349) that two hundred millions of beings 
penetrated to an understanding of the Dhamma at the conclusion of the Miracle.</p>
<p>The Twin Miracle can only be performed by the Buddha.
