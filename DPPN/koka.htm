<p>A hunter. While on his way to the forest 
with his dogs he meets a monk. He bags no game that day and blames the monk, 
whom he again meets on his way home. Koka sets his dogs on the monk, and when 
the latter climbs a tree, pierces the soles of his feet with arrows. The monk’s 
cloak falls upon the hunter, completely covering him. The dogs, thinking that 
the monk has fallen from the tree, devour their own master. The monk, fearing 
that he is to blame, seeks the Buddha, who reassures him and relates the story 
of a wicked physician who cajoled a boy into catching a snake, pretending that 
it was a bird. When the boy discovered that it was a snake, he threw it on the 
physician’s head, who died from its bite.</p>
<p>The physician is identified with Koka. 
DhA.iii.31f. </p>
<p>The story of the past is evidently 
derived from the Sāliya Jātaka, which, however, according to the Jātaka 
Commentary, was related in reference, not to Koka, but to Devadatta. 
(J.iii.202f).</p>
