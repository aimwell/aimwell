<p>1. Dhammagutta Thera.-An arahant. He 
lived in the Kalyānika-vihāra and was known as the “earth-shaker” (pathavicālaka). 
He was among those who received a share of the meal given by Dutthagāmani when 
the latter fled from Cūlanganiyapitthi. He shared his portion with five hundred 
others (Mhv.xxxii.50; xxiv.24ff). According to the Jātaka Commentary (J.iv.490), 
he was among those who joined in the assemblies (samāgama) known as 
Kuddalasamāgama, Mūgapakkhasamāgama, Ayogharasamāgama and Hatthipalasamāgama. 
The Mahāvamsa Tikā (p.606) mentions him as being one of those who accepted the 
meal of pork given by Sāliya and his wife, when they were blacksmiths, in their 
birth immediately preceding the last.</p>
