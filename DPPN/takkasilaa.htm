  <h2>Takkasilā</h2>

</ul>
<p>The capital of Gandhāra. It is 
frequently mentioned as a centre of education, especially in the Jātakas. It is 
significant that it is never mentioned in the suttas, though, according to 
numerous Jātaka stories, it was a great centre of learning from pre-Buddhistic 
times. The Commentaries mention that in the Buddha’s day, also, princes and 
other eminent men received their training at Takkasilā. Pasenadi, king of 
Kosala, Mahāli, chief of the Licchavis, and Bandhula, prince of the Mallas, were 
classmates in the university of Takkasilā (DhA.i.337). Among others described as 
being students of Takkasilā are Jīvaka, Angulimāla, Dhammapāla of Avanti, 
Kanhadinna, Bhāradvāja and Yasadatta (q.v.).</p>
<p>From Benares to Takkasilā was a distance 
of two thousand yojanas (J.i.395), though we are told that sometimes the journey 
was accomplished in one day (J.ii.47). The road passed through thick jungle 
infested by robbers (DhA.iv.66). Takkasilā was, however, a great centre of 
trade; people flocked to it from various parts of the country (MNid.i.154), not 
only from Benares, but also from Sāvatthi, from which city the road lay through 
Soreyya (DhA.i.326). In ancient times students came to the university from Lāla 
(J.i.447), from the Kuru country (DhA.iv.88), from Magadha (J.v.161), and from 
the Sivi country (J.v.210).</p>
<p>The students in the university studied 
the three Vedas and the eighteen sciences (vijjā) (J.i.159), which evidently 
included the science of archery (J.i.356; DhA.iv.66; also medicine and surgery, 
Vin.i.269f), the art of swordmanship (J.v.128), and elephant-craft (hatthi-sutta) 
(J.ii.47). Mention is also made of the study of magic, such as the Ālambanamanta, 
for charming snakes (J.iv.457), and the Nidhiuddharanamanta, for recovering 
buried treasure (J.iii.116). The students were also taught the science of ritual 
(manta) (J.ii.200); but in this branch of learning Benares seems to have had a 
greater reputation, for we find students being sent there from Takkasilā in 
order to learn the mantas (DhA.iii.445).</p>
<p>The students generally paid a fee to the 
teacher on admission, the usual amount being one thousand gold pieces. They 
waited on the teacher by day and were taught by him at night. The paying 
students were entitled to various privileges, and lived with the teacher as 
members of his family, enjoying his constant company. The students seem mostly 
to have done their own domestic work, leading a co-operate life, gathering their 
own firewood and cooking their meals, though mention is made of servants, both 
male and female, helping in the various tasks (J.i.319).</p>
<p>Only brāhmanas and khattiyas appear to 
have been eligible for admission to Takkasilā (J.iv.391).</p>
<p>Discipline was evidently very rigorous, 
a breach of the rules being severely punished, irrespective of the status of the 
pupil, who was sometimes flogged on the back with a bamboo stick (J.ii.277f). 
Often the most promising students were given the daughters of the teachers in 
marriage as a mark of very special favour. (E.g., DhA.iv.66. Elsewhere 
(J.vi.347) it is stated that the teacher’s daughter was given to the eldest 
pupil). </p>
<p>Sometimes the teacher and his pupils 
were invited to a meal at the house of a chief man of the city (J.iv.391). The 
principal teacher was called Disāpāmokkhācariya; under him were assistants, 
usually chosen from among his students, who were called pitthiācariyā (E.g., 
J.ii.100).</p>
<p>Takkasilā, being the capital of Gandhāra, 
was probably also the seat of government. Bimbisāra’s contemporary in Gandhāra 
was Pukkusāti (J.i.399; ii.218). Mention is made in the Jātakas of a 
Takkasilā-rājā (AA.i.153; MA.i.335; ii.979, 987f). According to the Kumbhakāra 
Jātaka (q.v.), Takkasilā was the capital of Naggaji. The Dīpavamsa (iii.31) 
records that twelve kings, descendants of Dīpankara, ruled in succession at 
Takkasilā.</p>
<p>It is said in the Divyāvadāna (p.371) 
that Bindusāra’s empire included Takkasilā. There was once a rebellion there and 
Asoka was sent to quell it. From the minor Rock Edict II. of Asoka it would 
appear that Takkasilā was the headquarters of a provincial government at 
Gandhāra, placed under a Kumāra or Viceroy. A rebellion broke out there again in 
the time of Asoka, who sent his son Kunāla to settle it.</p>
<p>Takkasilā is identified with the Greek 
Taxila, in Rawalpindi in the Punjab.</p>
