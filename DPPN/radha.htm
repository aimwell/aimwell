<h4>1. Rādha</h4>
<p>A parrot, brother of Potthapāda, the Bodhisatta. See the 
<a href="radha_jat_145_198.htm" title="r/radha_jat_145_198.htm">Rādha Jātaka</a> (1). He 
is identified with Ānanda. J.i.496.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Rādha</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a parrot. See the <a href="radha_jat_145_198.htm" title="r/radha_jat_145_198.htm">Rādha Jātaka</a> (2). </p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Rādha</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as a parrot. See the 
<a href="kaalabaahu_jat_329.htm" title="ka/kaalabaahu_jat_329.htm">Kālabāhu Jātaka</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="4">4</a>. Rādha Thera</h4>
<p>He was a brahmin of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> who, being neglected by his children in his old 
age, sought ordination. The monks refused his request on the ground of his age, 
so he sought the Buddha who, seeing his upanissaya, asked Sāriputta to admit 
him.* Soon after he won arahantship. </p>
<p>He stayed near the Buddha, and, by reason of his skill, the Buddha declared 
him foremost among those who could inspire speech in others (? patibhānakeyyānam) 
(A.i.25; ThagA.i.253f). </p>
<p>He thereby earned the name of Patibhāniya Thera (SA.ii.246). </p>
<p>The Theragāthā (vss.133 4) contains two verses spoken by him in praise of 
concentration of the mind. </p>
<p>The Rādha Samyutta (S.iii.188 201; see also <a href="radha_sutta.htm" title="r/radha_sutta.htm">Rādha Sutta</a>) contains a large 
number of suttas preached by the Buddha in answer to Rādha’s questions on 
various topics. </p>
<p>It is said that when the Buddha saw Rādha he felt the inclination to talk on 
matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes. 
SA.ii.246; this was because of Radha’s wealth of views (ditthisamudācāra) and 
unwavering faith (okappaniya-saddhā); AA.i.179; also ThagA.i.254.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>* It is probably this incident which is referred to at ThagA.ii.114, where 
  Sāriputta is said to have ordained a poor brahmin named Rādha, but no mention 
  is made of any order from the Buddha. If the reference is to this same thera, 
  Rādha was, for some time, the attendant (pacchāsamana) of Sāriputta, and there 
  is a verse in Thag. (993) spoken to him by Sāriputta, who was pleased with 
  Rādha’s gentle manner. DhA.ii.104ff. gives more details of the ordination of 
  Rādha. There we are told that he went to the monastery where he performed 
  various duties. But the monks would not admit him into the Order, and, owing 
  to his disappointment, he grew thin. One day the Buddha, seeing him with his 
  divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned 
  the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by Rādha. 
  Sāriputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of Rādha’s own food 
  while begging in Rājagaha. The Buddha then suggested that Sāriputta should 
  listen to Rādha’s request for ordination. After ordination, Rādha grew weary 
  of the food of the refectory, but Sāriputta constantly admonished him and 
  found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of Rādha’s obedience, and the 
  Buddha praised him. It was on Rādha’s account that the 
  <a href="aliinacitta_jat_156.htm" title="am/aliinacitta_jat_156.htm">Alīnacitta Jātaka</a> was preached. AA.i.179f. agrees, more or less, with the account given 
  above; so does Ap.ii.485f.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Rādha was a householder of Hamsavatī and 
held a great almsgiving in honour of the Buddha, wishing to gain pre eminence in 
the power of inspiring others to speak. He gave ripe mangoes to Vipassī Buddha 
(ThagA.i.253; AA.i.180; Ap.ii.484) and, as a result, was born in heaven.</p>
<p><a href="suraadha_thera.htm" title="s/suraadha_thera.htm">Surādha Thera</a> was his younger brother. Rādha was, for some time, the 
Buddha’s attendant. AA.i.163.</p>
