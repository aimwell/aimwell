  <h2>Ambacora Jātaka (No. 344)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of a wicked ascetic who built 
for himself a hut in a mango orchard on the river bank near 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and ate the 
ripe mangoes as they fell. In order to frighten him Sakka made the orchard 
appear as if it had been plundered by thieves. The ascetic, coming back from his 
begging-round and seeing what had happened, charged the four daughters of a 
merchant who had just entered the garden with having stolen the mangoes. They 
denied the charge and swore dreadful oaths to support their statement. Thereupon 
he let them go.</p>
<p>The story was told about an Elder who 
had entered the Order in his old age and who, instead of practising his duties, 
looked after mangoes. Thieves stole his mangoes, and he charged with the theft 
the four daughters of a rich merchant who happened to visit the park. They swore 
oaths to prove that they were not guilty and were released. J.iii.137-9.</p>
