<p>A public executioner of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. He had 
copper-coloured teeth and tawny skin, and his body was covered with scars. He 
wished to join a band of thieves, but, for some time, the ringleader refused to 
admit him on account of his inordinately cruel looks. In the end he was 
admitted; but when the thieves were captured and no one could be found willing 
to kill as many as five hundred of them, Tambadāthika agreed to do it for a 
reward, and slew all his colleagues. He was afterwards appointed public 
executioner and held the post for fifty-five years. When he became too old to 
behead a man with one blow, another was appointed in his place, and he was 
deprived of the four perquisites to which he had, for so many years, been 
entitled — old clothes, milk porridge made with fresh ghee, jasmine flowers, and 
perfumes. </p>
<p>On the day on which he was deposed from office, he gave orders for 
milk porridge to be cooked, and having bathed and decked himself out, he was 
about to eat, when <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, out of compassion for him, appeared at his door. Tambadāthika invited the Elder in and entertained him hospitably. When Sāriputta 
began the words of thanksgiving, his host could not concentrate his thoughts, 
being worried by memories of his past wickedness. Sāriputta consoled him by 
representing to him that he had merely carried out the king’s orders. At the end 
of the sermon, Tambadāthika developed the qualities necessary for becoming a 
Sotāpanna. When Sāriputta left, Tambadāthika accompanied him on his way, but on 
the way back he was gored to death by a cow. </p>
<p>The cow was a Yakkhinī who also killed:</p>
