<p>1. Kapi Jātaka (No.250).-Once when the 
Bodhisatta was living the ascetic life in the Himalaya, his wife having died, a 
monkey came in the rainy weather to the hermitage clad in an anchorite’s robe 
which he had found in the forest. The Bodhisatta recognised the monkey and drove 
him away.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
hypocritical brother. J.ii.268ff</p>
<p>2. Kapi Jātaka (No.404).-Once the 
Bodhisatta and Devadatta were both born as monkeys. One day a mischievous monkey 
took his seat on the arch which was over the gateway to the park and, when the 
king’s chaplain passed under the arch, he let excrement fall on his head, and, 
on the chaplain looking up, even into his mouth. The chaplain swore vengeance on 
the monkeys, and the Bodhisatta, hearing of it, counseled them to seek residence 
elsewhere. His advice was followed by all except the monkey, who was Devadatta, 
and a few of his followers. Sometime after, the king’s elephants were burnt 
through a fire breaking out in their stalls. A goat had eaten some rice put out 
to dry and was beaten with a torch; his hair caught fire and the fire spread to 
the stalls. The chaplain, seizing his opportunity, told the elephant-doctors 
that the best remedy for burns was monkey-fat, and five hundred monkeys in the 
royal gardens were slain by archers for the sake of their fat.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta being swallowed up by the earth. J.iii.355f; cp. Kāka Jātaka.</p>
