<p>A deva. In his previous birth he was a frog on the banks 
of the Gaggarā, and, hearing the Buddha preach, was attracted by his voice. A 
cowherd, who stood leaning on a stick, drove it unwittingly into the frog’s head 
and it died immediately, to be reborn in Tāvatimsa in a palace twelve yojanas in 
extent. Having discovered his previous birth, he appeared before the Buddha, 
revealed his identity and worshipped him. The Buddha preached to him, and the 
deva became a sotāpanna. Eighty four thousand others realized the Truth. Vv.v.1; 
VvA.216ff.; Vsm.208f.; Sp.i.121; Mil.350.</p>
