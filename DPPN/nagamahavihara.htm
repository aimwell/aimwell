<p>A monastery in Rohana, built by Mahānāga, ruler of 
Mahāgāma and brother of Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xxii.9). Ilanāga restored it and 
bestowed land for its maintenance (Ibid.,xxxv.31; MT.469). A story is related of 
a monk of this vihāra who cut down a nāga tree near the monastery. The devatā 
living in the tree was annoyed, and announced to the Thera that the king who 
looked after him would die in seven days. The Thera mentioned this in the 
palace; seven days passed and, as nothing happened. 
The king had the Thera’s hands and feet cut off 
(VibhA.407). Near the monastery was a village named Kelakacchagāma (c.l. 
Kālagacchagāma) (MA.ii.1025). Dappula gave the village of Kevattagambhīra to the 
vihāra (Cv.x1v.58).</p>
