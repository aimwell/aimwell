  <h2>Sirikālakannipañha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to that section of the Mahāummagga Jātaka 
which deals with the coming of Vedeha to win Udumbarā, when she was deserted by 
Pinguttara. It also tells of how Mahosadha once rescued her from the king’s 
wrath (J.vi.349).</p>
<p>This was also evidently called a Jātaka by the same name. 
E.g., at J.ii.115.</p>
