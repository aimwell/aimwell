  <h2>Lankā, Lankādīpa, Lankātala</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Pāli names for Ceylon, found in the Chronicles — 
e.g., Dipavamsa, Mahāvamsa and the Commentaries. </p>
<p>An ancient tradition recorded in the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xv. 
57ff), and in the Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.86ff), gives the names of the Island in 
the times of the three previous Buddhas, the names of the capital cities, the 
different names of Mahāmeghavana, and of the kings contemporary with these 
Buddhas. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Thus, in the time of Kakusandha, the Island was called 
  Ojadīpa, the king was Abhaya, the capital Abhayapura and Mahāmeghavana, 
  Mahātittha. </li>
  <li>In the time of Konāgamana, the Island was Varadīpa, the 
  capital Vaddhamāna, the king Samiddha and the park Mahānoma. </li>
  <li>In the time of Kassapa, the Island was Mandadīpa, the 
  king Jayanta, the capital Visālā and the park Mahāsāgara. </li>
</ul>
<p>Besides Mahāmeghavana, the other physical feature of 
Ceylon, mentioned in these accounts, is the mountain known in the present age as 
Sumanakūta, whereon the Buddha Gotama placed his footprint. During the ages of 
the three previous Buddhas, it was known, respectively, as Devakūta, 
Sumanakūtaka and Subhakūta. Gotama paid three visits to Ceylon, while the other 
three Buddhas came only once. During their visits they consecrated various spots 
by spending there a short time wrapt in meditation.</p>
<p>Lankā was once inhabited by Yakkhas. Gotama Buddha obliged 
them to leave the Island and seek shelter in the neighboring Giridīpa. Lankādīpa 
was later colonized by Vijaya and his three hundred companions. Two cities of 
the Yakkhas are mentioned: Sirīsavatthu and Lankāpura.</p>
