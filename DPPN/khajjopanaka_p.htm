<p>When, as a result of the conspiracy of 
Senaka and the other ministers of Vedeha, Mahosadha was compelled to flee from 
the Court and live as a potter outside the city gates, the devatā of the king’s 
parasol, wishing to see him reinstated, appeared to the king and put to him 
several questions. The king consulted Senaka and his colleagues, but they could 
find no solution. The deity appeared again to him and said he was like a man 
who, wanting a fire, blows a firefly, crumbling over it cow-dung and grass, or, 
wanting milk, milks the cow’s horn. She then threatened the king with death if 
her questions were not answered. In despair, the king sent for Mahosadha 
(J.vi.371f).</p>
<p>It is evidently this story which is 
mentioned elsewhere (J.iii.197) as a separate Jātaka, but no details are given, 
and the reader is referred to the Khajjopanaka-Pañha.</p>
