<h2>Nigrodha Jātaka (No. 445)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A king, named Magadha, once reigned in Rājagaha. His son 
married a rich merchant’s daughter, but she, because she was barren, lost 
favour. Thereupon she pretended to be with child, and when her time drew near, 
she journeyed to her home with an old nurse who was in the secret. On the way 
she found a child deserted by its mother, and, greatly rejoicing, she claimed it 
as her own. The child was the Bodhisatta and was called Nigrodha. His father 
found for him two companions: Sakhā, son of a merchant, and Pottika, son of a 
tailor.  </p>
<p>These three grew up together and were educated in Takkasilā. In the 
course of their travels, while his companions lay sleeping, Pottika heard a cock 
say that whoever ate its fat would become king, the flesh of its body commander 
in chief, and the flesh near its bone’s treasurer. Pottika killed the cock, gave 
to Nigrodha the fat, to Sākha the flesh of the body, while he himself ate the 
flesh near the bones. Immediately after, men, in search of a successor to the 
throne of Benares chose Nigrodha, while the others accompanied him as commander 
in chief and treasurer. One day Nigrodha, wishing to have his parents near him, 
sent Pottika to fetch them from Rājagaha. On the way back he called at Sākha’s 
house, but Sākha, who had a grievance against him for having given the cock’s 
fat to Nigrodha, insulted him. When Pottika reported this to Nigrodha, he wished 
to have Sākha killed, but Pottika intervened on his behalf.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta’s</a> 
ingratitude. Sākha is identified with Devadatta and Pottika with
