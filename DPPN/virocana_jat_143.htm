<p>The Bodhisatta was once a lion and lived in Kañcanaguhā. 
He granted to a jackal the favour of being allowed to inform him of the presence 
of prey, the animal being given a portion of the carcase in return for this 
service. In time the jackal grew strong and begged to be allowed to kill an 
elephant. The lion reluctantly agreed to this, but the jackal, in his attempts 
to leap on to the elephant, missed his aim and fell to the ground where he was 
crushed to death.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempt 
to pose as the Buddha and his failure to do so, wherefore he received a kick on 
the chest from Kokālika (q.v.). The jackal is identified with Devadatta. J.i.490-3.</p>
