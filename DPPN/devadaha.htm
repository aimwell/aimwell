<p><b>1. Devadaha.</b>-A township (nigama) 
of the <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyans</a>. The Buddha stayed there during his tours and preached to the 
monks on various topics (S.iii.5f; iv.124f; M.ii.214). According to the 
Commentaries (J.i.52; BuA.226; MA.ii.924, 1021, etc; ThigA.182) it was the city 
of the birth of the <a href="mahamaayaa.htm" title="maha/mahamaayaa.htm">Buddha’s mother</a> and of
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Pajāpatī Gotamī</a> and of their 
companions, who married the Sākiyans of <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="lumbini.htm" title="l/lumbini.htm">Lumbinīvana</a>, where the 
Buddha was born, was near Devadaha. The name was originally that of a lake, so 
called either because kings held their sports in it (devā vuccanti rājāno tesam 
mangaladaho), or because it came into existence without human intervention, 
hence divine (sayañjāto vā so daho, tasmā pi Devadaho). The name was later 
transferred to the village near by. SA.ii.186; also MA.ii.810. Acc. to the Dulva 
(Rockhill, p.12), the city was founded by Sākiyans from Kapilavatthu, when they 
grew very numerous. The spot was pointed out by a deva, hence its name.

<p><b>1. Devadaha Vagga</b>.-The eleventh 
section of the Majjhima Nikāya (suttas 101-10), the Devadaha Sutta being its 
first sutta. M.ii.214ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Devadaha Vagga</b>.-The fourteenth 
chapter of the Salāyatana Samyutta. S.iv.124ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Devadaha Sutta</b>.-Preached to 
the monks at Lumbinīvana (MA.ii.810), in Devadaha. It deals with the teaching of 
the Niganthas, that whatsoever the individual experience, it comes from former 
actions. The sutta also gives ten beliefs of the Niganthas, which, the Buddha 
says, are to be condemned. In contrast to these, ten statements are made 
respecting the Tathāgata, which are intrinsically true. M.ii.214ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Devadaha Sutta</b>.-Preached to 
the monks at Devadaha. Some monks, going to reside in the western districts, 
come to the Buddha to take leave of him. He advises them, before starting, to 
visit Sāriputta, whom he extols. This they do, and Sāriputta explains to them 
the fundamental teachings of the Buddha, in order that they may be ready to 
answer any questions which may be put to them. S.iii.6ff.</p>
