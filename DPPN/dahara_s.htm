  <h2>Dahara Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Jetavana to Pasenadi. 
Pasenadi hints that the Buddha is young and, as compared with other teachers, 
not fully enlightened. The Buddha explains to him that there are four things in 
the world which must not be lightly regarded on account of their youth — a noble 
prince, a snake, a fire, and a holy man (bhikkhu). </p>
<p>It was this sutta which effected the 
conversion of Pasenadi. S.i.68f. </p>
<p>The Northern books call it the 
Kumāradrstānta Sutra (Rockhill: p.49).</p>
