  <h2>Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached by the Buddha at Ambalatthikā 
(near Veluvana) to Rāhula. It deals with falsehood. Like a minute drop of water 
is the recluse ship of those who shrink not from deliberate lying, it is thrown 
away, upset; it is empty and void. There is nothing evil they will not do, they 
run every risk, like an elephant who guards not his trunk. One should practise 
constant reflection, thereby abandoning all things conducive to woe, either to 
oneself or to others, and develop self-control and purity (M.i.414-20). Rāhula 
was evidently yet very young at the time of this sermon, for we find the Buddha 
making use of frequent similes, and pointing them out to him. According to the 
Cy., he was at the time only 7 years old (MA. ii. 636).</p>
<p>The Commentary says that it was preached 
because very young novices might be tempted to say things both proper and 
improper; they were likely to imagine things. This sutta is to warn Rāhula 
against the use of lies (MA.ii.635f.; AA.i.145; ii.547).</p>
<p>The Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta is 
among the portions of scripture mentioned in the Bhābrā Edict of Asoka as being 
essentially worthy of study by all monks (See Mookerji: Asoka, p.119) (v.l. 
Ambalatthiya°).</p>
