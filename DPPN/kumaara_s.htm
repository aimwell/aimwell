<p>The Licchavi Mahānāma sees a number of 
Licchavi youths sitting by the Buddha, at the foot of a tree in the Mahāvana at 
Vesāli; be expresses his joy at the sight for, he says, the Licchavis are 
usually so mischievous. The Buddha thereupon tells Mahānāma of five things the 
practice of which will tend to progress: the tending of father and mother, the 
support of wife and children with well-gotten wealth, devotion to one’s own 
business, honouring one’s own ancestral gods, showing respect to good and holy 
men. A.iii.75ff.</p>
