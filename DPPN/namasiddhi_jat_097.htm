<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a famous teacher of Takkasilā, and 
among his pupils was one named Pāpaka. He, wishing for a less ill omened name, 
consulted his teacher. The Bodhisatta suggested that Pāpaka should travel and 
find a suitable name. He came back a wiser man, for he discovered that “Jīvakas” 
died and that “Dhanapālīs” grovelled in poverty&nbsp;&nbsp; the name signified 
nothing.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk called Pāpaka 
who wished to change his name. The two are identical. J.i.401ff.</p>
