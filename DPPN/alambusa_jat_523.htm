<p>Isisiṅga, son of the Bodhisatta and of a 
doe, who had drunk water into which the Bodhisatta’s semen had fallen, lived the 
ascetic life like his father. He had been warned by his father about the wiles 
of women, and lived in the forest practising the most severe austerities. By 
virtue of the power of these austerities, Sakka’s abode trembled, and Sakka, 
fearing his rivalry, sent down a beautiful celestial nymph, Alambusā, to tempt 
him and despoil him of his virtue.</p>
<p>This she succeeded in doing, and for three years he lay unconscious in her embrace. At last, realising what had 
happened, he forthwith forsook sensual desire, and developing mystic meditation, 
attained to jhāna. Alambusā pleaded for forgiveness, which was readily granted. 
The story was related in reference to the temptation of a monk by the wife he 
had had during his lay life (J.v.152-61. See also the Nalinikā J. (v.193f.) 
where Isisiṅga is tempted by Nalinikā).</p>
<p>In the Digha Nikāya Commentary (ii.370; 
see also Sp.i.214. Cp. the story of Rsyasrnga in the Ramayana i.9. The story is 
found in the Bharhut Tope, see Cunningham, CSB.29, P1.15) the name of the 
ascetic is given as Migasingi, and the story is quoted as an instance of a wrong 
explanation of the cessation of consciousness.</p>
