</ul>
<p>A group of monks, contemporary with the 
Buddha, frequently mentioned as being guilty of various Vinaya offences. 
Vin.i.84f, 104, 106, 111, 113, 114, 138, 160, 170, 185, 189, 192, 194, 203f, 
216, 285, 306, 316; ii.73, 105ff, 145ff, 213ff, 241, 262, etc.: J.i.191, 217, 
360; iii.149; DhA.iii.48f., 330, 382.</p>
<p>Six monks — <a href="assaji.htm" title="ay/assaji.htm">Assaji</a>, 
<a href="punabbasu.htm" title="pu/punabbasu.htm">Punabbasu</a>, <a href="panduka.htm" title="pa/panduka.htm">Panduka</a>, 
Lohitaka, Mettiya and Bhummaja — were their leaders, hence their name.</p>
<p>There were also nuns in their following, 
who likewise violated the Vinaya rules in various ways. (Vin.ii.262, 266, 269, 
271, 276).</p>
<p>It is said that Assaji and Punabbasu had 
their headquarters at <a href="kitaagiri.htm" title="ku/kitaagiri.htm">Kītāgiri</a>, Mettiya and Bhummaja(ka) at 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and Panduka 
and Lohitaka at <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> (J.ii.387).</p>
<p>According to the Samantapāsādikā 
(iii.613f) they were all of Sāvatthi and all originally acquainted. Finding a 
living hard to obtain, they entered the Order under the two Chief Disciples. 
They decided among themselves that it was unwise for them all to live in the 
same place, and they therefore divided into three groups as mentioned above. 
Each group had five hundred monks attached to it. Of the three groups, the 
followers of Panduka and Lohitaka were the most virtuous. They remained near the 
Buddha, accompanying him on his tours. They did not, like the others, transgress 
Vinaya rules.</p>
