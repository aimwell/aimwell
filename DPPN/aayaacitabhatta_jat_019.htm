  <h2>Āyācitabhatta Jātaka (No. 19)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the squire of a certain village, in 
the Kāsi country, promised the deity of a banyan tree a sacrifice should his 
enterprise succeed. When he came back from his journey he slew a number of 
creatures and took them to the tree. The deity of the tree appeared and 
admonished the squire, saying that <b>no one could attain deliverance by means 
of slaughter</b>.</p>
<p>The story was related in answer to a 
question by some monks, who had noticed that many people when going on a 
business journey would slay living creatures and offer them to various deities 
in order that their ventures might be successful. The monks wished to know if 
such sacrifices were of any good (J.i.169).</p>
<p>The Jātaka is also known as the 
Pānavadha Jātaka (Feer: JA.1876, p.516).</p>
