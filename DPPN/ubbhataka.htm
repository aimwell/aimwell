<p>A mote-hall built by the <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallas</a> of 
<a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>. 
When it was finished they invited the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> to be its first occupant. The 
Buddha went with the monks and spent the night in the hall. It was on this 
occasion that <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> recited the
<a href="sangiti_sutta.htm" title="sa/sangiti_sutta.htm">Sangīti Sutta</a> (D.iii.207ff).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (DA.iii.971) that the 
hall was so-called (“Thrown-aloft-er”) because of its great height.</p>
