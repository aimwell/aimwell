<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvathi, and, after 
hearing the Buddha preach, he entered the Order. While meditating in a forest 
tract in Kosala, he grew slothful and rough in speech. One day the Buddha, 
seeing his maturing insight, appeared before him in a ray of glory and 
admonished him with averse. Belatthānika was filled with agitation and soon 
after became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, 
and, while wandering about with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and offered him 
seven flowers. Twenty nine kappas ago he became king under the name of 
Vipulābhāsa (Thag.vs.101; ThagA.i.205f). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Campakapupphiya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.167.</p>
