<p>President of the Third Council. In his penultimate birth 
he was a Brahmā, called Tissa, and consented to be born in the world of men at 
the urgent request of the arahants who held the Second Council, in order to 
prevent the downfall of the Buddha’s religion. He was born in the home of the 
brahmin Moggali of Pātaliputta. Siggava and Candavajji had been entrusted with 
the task of converting him. From the time of Tissa’s birth, therefore, for seven 
years, Siggava went daily to the house of Moggali, but not even one word of 
welcome did he receive. In the eighth year someone said to him, “Go further on.” 
As he went out he met Moggali, and, on being asked whether he had received 
anything at his house, he said he had. Moggali inquired at home and the next day 
charged Siggava with lying. But hearing Siggava’s explanation, he was greatly 
pleased and thereafter constantly offered Siggava hospitality at his house. One 
day, young Tissa, who was thoroughly proficient in the Vedas, was much annoyed 
at finding Siggava occupying his seat and spoke to him harshly. But Siggava 
started to talk to him and asked him a question from the Cittayamaka. Tissa 
could not answer it, and, in order to learn the Buddha’s teachings, he entered 
the Order under Siggava, becoming a sotāpanna soon after. Siggava instructed him 
in the Vinaya and Candavajji in the Sutta and Abhidhamma Pitakas. In due course 
he attained arahantship and became the acknowledged leader of the monks at 
Pātaliputta (Mhv.v.95ff., 131ff.; Dpv.v.55ff.; Sp.i.35 41).</p>
<p>At the festival of dedication of the Asokārāma and the 
other vihāras built by Asoka, Moggaliputta Tissa informed Asoka, in answer to a 
question, that one becomes a kinsman of the Buddha’s religion only by letting 
one’s son or daughter enter the Order. Acting on this suggestion, Asoka had both 
his children ordained. Moggaliputta acted as Mahinda’s upajjhāya (Mhv.v.191ff.; 
Sp.i.50f). Later, because of the great gains which accrued to the monks through 
Asoka’s patronage of the Buddha’s religion, the Order became corrupt, and 
Moggaliputta committed the monks to the charge of Mahinda, and, for seven years, 
lived in solitary retreat on the Ahogangā pabbata. From there Asoka sent for him 
to solve his doubts as to what measure of sin belonged to him owing to the 
murder of the monks by his minister. But Moggaliputta would not come until 
persuaded that his services were needed to befriend the religion. He traveled by 
boat to Pātaliputta, and was met at the landing place by the king who helped him 
out by supporting him on his arm.</p>
<p>According to Sp.i.58, the king had a dream on the 
preceding night which the soothsayers interpreted to mean that a great ascetic (samananāga) 
would touch his right hand. As the Thera touched the king’s hand the attendants 
were about to kill him, for to do this was a crime punishable by death. The 
king, however, restrained them. The Thera took the king’s hand as a sign that he 
accepted him as pupil.</p>
<p>The king, having led him to Rativaddhana Park, begged him 
to perform a miracle. This the Thera consented to do and made the earth quake in 
a single region. To convince the king that the murder of the monks involved no 
guilt for himself, the Thera preached to him the Tittira Jātaka. Within a week, 
with the aid of two yakkhas, the king had all the monks gathered together and 
held an assembly at the Asokārāma. In the presence of Moggaliputta, Asoka 
questioned the monks on their various doctrines, and all those holding heretical 
views were expelled from the Order, Moggaliputta decreeing that the Vibhajjavāda 
alone contained the teaching of the Buddha. Later, in association with one 
thousand arahants, Moggaliputta held the Third Council at Asokārāma, with 
himself as President, and compiled the Kathāvatthuppakarana, in refutation of 
false views. This was in the seventeenth year of Asoka’s reign and Moggaliputta 
was seventy two years old (Mhv.v.231 81; Dpv.vii.16ff., 39ff.; Sp.i.57ff). At 
the conclusion of the Council in nine months, Moggaliputta made arrangements, in 
the month of Kattika, for monks to go to the countries adjacent to India for the 
propagation of the religion (For a list of these, see Mhv.xii.1ff.; 
Dpv.viii.1ff.; Sp.i.63ff). Later, when the request came from Ceylon for a branch 
of the Bodhi tree, Asoka consulted the Elder as to how this could be carried 
out, and Moggaliputta told him of the five resolves made by the Buddha on his 
death bed (Mhv.xviii.21ff).</p>
<p>The Dīpavamsa says (Dpv. 68ff., 82, 94, 96, 100f. 107f.; 
also vii.23ff ) that Moggaliputta Tissa’s ordination was in the second year of 
Candagutta’s reign, when Siggava was sixty four years old. Candagutta reigned 
for twenty four years, and was followed by Bindusāra, who reigned for thirty 
seven years, and he was succeeded by Asoka. In the sixth year of Asoka’s reign, 
Moggaliputta was sixty-six years old, and it was then that he ordained Mahinda. 
He was eighty years old at the time of his death and had been leader of the 
Order for sixty eight years. He died in the twenty sixth year of Asoka’s reign.</p>
