<p>A class of long lived deities. Hearing that the Buddha was 
to be born, they started to make garlands to put on him on the day of his birth, 
but even on the day of his death these garlands were not finished, because, 
according to their computation, the time had passed so quickly. When they heard 
that the Buddha was about to die, they brought the unfinished garlands, but 
could not get anywhere within the Cakkavāla. They therefore remained in the sky, 
singing the praises of the Buddha. DA.ii.576f.</p>
