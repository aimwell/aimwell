<p>Once, when the Buddha visited Anāthapindika’s house, he 
heard a great noise, and when he asked the reason for this, he was told that it 
was due to Anāthapindika’s daughter in law, Sujātā, who had come from a wealthy 
family and would not listen to anyone’s advice. The Buddha sent for her and told 
her of seven kinds of wives in the world&nbsp;&nbsp; the slayer, the robber, the 
mistress, the mother, the sister, the companion, the handmaid&nbsp;&nbsp; and 
described their qualities. Sujātā, much impressed, said that henceforth she 
would be a handmaid (A.iv.91f).</p>
<p>The Commentary says (AA.ii.724) that she was established 
in the Refuges; but see Sujātā.</p>
