<h2>Mahā-Satipatthāna Sutta&nbsp; </h2>
<p>Preached at Kammāssadamma in the Kuru country. The Buddha 
tells the monks that the one and only path leading to Nibbāna is that of the 
Four Bases of Mindfulness. These, in brief, are the four ways of directing the 
mind to the impurities and the impermanency of body:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) kāya, physical 
structure and activities;  </li>
  <li>(2) vedanā, the emotional nature, first as bare 
feeling, then as having ethical implications;  </li>
  <li>(3) citta, conscious life or 
intelligence, considered under ethical aspects;  </li>
  <li>(4) dhamma, considered under the 
five hindrances; the five groups (khandhas), the six spheres of sense, the seven 
bojjhangas, and the four Ariyan Truths. D.ii.290 315.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sutta is considered as one of the most important in 
the Buddhist Canon. It has been translated into various languages, and several 
commentaries on it are in existence. Its mere recital is said to ward off 
dangers and to bring happiness, and it is the desire of every Buddhist that he 
shall die with the Satipatthāna Sutta on his lips, or, at least, with the sound 
of it in his ears.</p>
<p>The materials found in the Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta are 
found also in the Majjhima Nikāya, broken up into two portions, each 
representing a separate discourse&nbsp;-&nbsp; the Satipatthāna Sutta and the Saccavibhanga Sutta.</p>
