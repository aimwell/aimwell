  <h2>Licchavī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful tribe of India in the time of the Buddha. They 
were certainly khattiyas, for on that ground they claimed a share of the 
Buddha’s relics. D.ii.165; according to the Mtu.i.283, etc., 
they belonged to the Vāsistha gotta; cp. the Mallas (q.v.), who are called 
Vāsetthas.</p>
<p>Their capital was Vesāli, and they formed a part of the 
Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjīs (q.v.). Their 
strength lay in their great unity; if one Licchavi fell ill, all the others 
would visit him. The whole tribe would join in any ceremony performed in the 
house of Licchavi, and they would all unite in honouring any distinguished 
visitors to their city (DA.ii.519). They were beautiful to look at and wore 
brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages (D.ii.96; 
A.iii.219: cp. Mtu.i.259). The Buddha once compared them to the gods of 
Tāvatimsa (D.ii.96; also DhA.iii.280).</p>
<p>Though this would seem to indicate that they were very 
prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness. 
They are, on the contrary, spoken of (S.ii.267f) as sleeping on straw couches, 
being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service (as skilful hardy 
archers, says the Commentary). They also practised seven conditions of welfare (aparihānīyadhammā), 
which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) They held frequent public meetings of their tribe 
  which they all attended; </li>
  <li>(2) they met together to make their decisions and 
  carried out their undertakings in concord; </li>
  <li>(3) they upheld tradition and honoured their pledges;
  </li>
  <li>(4) they respected and supported their elders; 
  </li>
  <li>(5) no women or girls were allowed to be taken by force 
  or abduction; </li>
  <li>(6) they maintained and paid due respect to their 
  places of worship; </li>
  <li>(7) they supported and fully protected the holy men 
  (arahants) among them (D.ii.73f.; A.iv.15f).</li>
</ul>
<p>The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of 
archery, for mention is made (A.iii.76) of large numbers of them roving about in 
the Mahāvana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds. 
They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, 
Mahānāma complaining (A.iii.76, the Lalitavistara is even more condemnatory) of 
them to the Buddha: “The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy 
fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe&nbsp;&nbsp; 
sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; they loot and 
eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.” Violation of 
chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly 
would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife 
should be murdered (Vin.iv.225).</p>
<p>According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout 
followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred 
Licchavis once gave a garment each to Pingiyāni, because he recited a verse in 
praise of the Buddha (A.iii.239). Even careless boys, referred to above as 
wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when 
they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped 
hands, eager to hear him (A.iii.76). There were numerous shrines in Vesāli 
itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, 
Gotama, Sārandada and Udena. Buddhaghosa says (E.g., UdA.322f ) that these 
shrines were originally Yakkha cetiyas, where various Yakkhas were worshipped, 
but that they were later converted into monasteries for the Buddha and his 
Order. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves (E.g., in the 
story of the general Sīha), that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The 
Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as 
staying in Kūtāgārasālā (q.v.) in Mahāvana. The first visit was in order to 
destroy the threefold panic of drought, sickness and non human foes. It was 
probably this act which earned for the Buddha the gratitude of the Licchavis. 
There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes (E.g., A.v.133f ) 
disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in 
Gosingasālāvana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a 
discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya 
regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion 
(A.iii.167f).</p>
<p>But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. 
When Saccaka the Nigantha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by 
five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but 
showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger (M.i.229; 
MA.i.454 gives their reasons). Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned 
by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, 
Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sālha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga. Several 
Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order — e.g., the famous courtesan 
Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīhā and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta 
and Sambhūta. </p>
<p>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of 
government. It was a republic (gana, sangha), all the leading members of which 
were called rājā. According to Mtu.i.271, there were 68,000 rājās in Vesāli; the 
Jātakas (i.504; iii.1) speak of 7707; DhA.iii.436.</p>
<p>They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems 
affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. 
When the assembly drum was heard, all left other duties and assembled 
immediately in the Santhāgārasālā (DA.ii.517f). Sometimes, as appears from the 
story of the conversion of Sīha, religion was also discussed at these meetings. 
The rules of procedure adopted evidently resembled those followed in the 
upasatitpāda ordination of a monk. See D.ii.76f., where the Buddha enjoins on 
the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These 
are given at Vin.i.56 (VT.i.169f.).</p>
<p>Besides the rājās there were also numerous uparājās, 
senāpatis, and bhandāgārikas (J.iii.1). There was an elaborate judicial 
procedure by which any person charged with an offence was handed over, in turn, 
to the Vinicchayamahāmattas (inquirers), the Vohārikas (experts in law), 
Suttadharas (experts in tradition), the Atthakulakas (probably a judicial 
committee), the Senāpati, the Uparājā, and finally to the Rājā, who would 
inflict the proper sentence according to the pavenipotthaka (DA.ii.519).</p>
<p>In their political relationships with their neighbours, 
the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra (q.v.), king of 
Magadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala (See, e.g., M.ii.101, where Pasenadi 
says this). Generally speaking, they were friendly also with the Mallas, though 
the story of Bandhula (q.v.) shows that a certain amount of rivalry existed 
between the two tribes.</p>
<p>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire 
for the expansion of Magadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis. He was probably 
partly influenced by his fear of his foster brother Abhayarājakumāra (q.v.), who 
had in him Licchavi blood. Buddhaghosa gives another story. (DA.ii.516f.; 
AA.ii.703; was the port Pātaligāma? see UdA.408). There was a port on the 
Ganges, extending over one yojana, half of which territory belonged to 
Ajātasattu, and the other half to the Licchavis. Near by was a mountain, from 
which much fragrant material (? gandhabhanda) flowed into the river. While 
Ajātasattu was making preparations to claim his portion of this material, the 
Licchavis would go before him and remove it all. This happened on several 
occasions, and Ajātasattu vowed vengeance. In order to discover what the Buddha 
thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister Vassakāra. The 
Buddha predicted (D.ii.72ff ) that as long as the Licchavis remained united they 
were proof against any foe. Ajātasattu then decided to bring about disunion 
among them. He was successful in this, with the aid of Vassakāra. (For details 
see Vassakāra). When Ajātasattu arrived at the gates of Vesāli, the Licchavis, 
owing to their disunion, were unable to put up any opposition, and Ajātasattu 
captured the city without further trouble (DA.ii.524). The degeneration may have 
set in earlier among the Licchavis, for we find reference to their giving up 
their earlier austere habits and to their fondness for soft pillows, long sleep 
and other luxuries. (S.ii.268; see also DhA.iii.280, where they quarrel over a 
woman; cp. Sp.i.284). Their power and prosperity were probably also weakened by 
the plague and drought which had ravaged Vesāli.</p>
<p>The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin 
of the Licchavis. (MA.i.258; KhpA. etc.; for a very comprehensive account of the 
Licchavis, see Law, Ksatriya Clans in Buddhist India, pp.1ff). The queen of 
Benares gave birth to a lump of flesh, and, wishing to avoid disgrace, her 
ladies in waiting put it in a sealed casket and threw it into the Ganges. A deva 
wrote the king’s name on the casket, which was picked up by an ascetic, who 
tended the embryo until two children, a boy and a girl, emerged from it. The 
ascetic fed them with milk. Whatever entered the stomachs of the children could 
be seen as though the stomach were transparent, so that they appeared skinless (nicchavi); 
some said the skin was so thin (līnachavī) that the stomach and whatever entered 
it appeared as though sewn together. From this the children came to be called 
Licchavi, and, as they grew, were brought up by the villagers living near the 
hermitage. The other children disliked them, saying they were to be avoided (vajjitabbā) 
because of their quarrelsome disposition. When they were sixteen years old the 
villagers obtained land for them from the king, founded a town, and married them 
together. Their country came to be called Vajjī. They had sixteen pairs of 
twins, and their city had to be greatly enlarged — 
hence its name, Visālā or Vesāli.</p>
