<p><b>1. Vijaya. </b>The first Ariyan king of Ceylon. He was 
the eldest of the thirty two sons of <a href="siihabaahu.htm" title="s/siihabaahu.htm">Sīhabāhu</a>, king of Lāla, and of Sīhasīvalī. 
Because of his evil conduct he, with seven hundred others, was deported by the 
king, with their heads half shaved. Their wives and children were deported with 
them. The children landed at Naggadīpa and the women at Mahilādīpaka (MT. 264). 
Vijaya and the other men landed at Suppāraka, but was obliged to leave owing to 
the violence of his supporters.  </p>
<p>According to Dpv.ix.26, Vijaya went from 
Suppāraka to Bhārukaccha, where he stayed for three months. They reached Ceylon 
on the day of the Buddha’s death, received the protection of the deva 
Uppalavanda, and thus escaped destruction by the Yakkhas. The Yakkhinī, Kuvenī, 
fell in love with Vijaya, and he, with her assistance, killed the Yakkhas of 
Lankāpura and Sirīsavatthu, and founded the city of Tambapanni. Vijaya’s chief 
ministers, Anurādha, Upatissa, Ujjena, Uruvela and Vijita, founded separate 
colonies, named after themselves.</p>
<p>Vijaya had two children by Kuvenī, Jīvahattha and Dīpellā; 
but when he wished to be consecrated king, he sent for and obtained, for his 
wife, a daughter of the Pandu king of Madhurā. Kuvenī, thereupon, left him and 
was killed by the Yakkhas. Vijaya reigned for thirty eight years and was 
succeeded by Panduvāsudeva. For details of Vijaya’s life, see Mhv.vi.38ff.; 
vii.6ff.; viii.1 3; Dpv.ix.6ff.</p>
<p><a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> and Vijaya were contemporaries, Ajātasattu’s 
twenty fourth year of kingship corresponding to Vijaya’s sixteenth year. 
Dpv.iv.27; v.77.</p>

<p><b>2. Vijaya. </b>See Vijayakumāra.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vijaya</b>. Minister of Angati, king of 
<a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a>. For 
details see the <a href="mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm" title="maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm">Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka</a>. He is identified with Sāriputta. 
J.vi.255.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vijaya.</b> A king of Benares, descended from 
<a href="mahasammata.htm" title="maha/mahasammata.htm">Mahāsammata</a>. His son was Vijitasena. Dpv.iii.39.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vijaya.</b> A householder, mentioned as an exemplary 
layman. A.iii.451.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vijaya Thera</b>. He was born in Sāvatthi and was 
versed in brahmin lore. Then he became an ascetic and lived in the forest. 
Having heard of the Buddha, Vijaya visited him and joined the Order, becoming an 
arahant in due course. In the time of Piyadassī Buddha he was a rich householder 
and built a jewelled cornice (vedikā) round the Buddha’s thūpa. Sixteen kappas 
ago he became king thirty six times, under the name of Manippabhāsa (Thag. vs. 
92; ThagA.i.191f). He is probably identical with Vedikāraka Thera of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.171.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Vijaya. </b>Mentioned with Jātimitta, as a patron of 
Meteyya Buddha. Anāgat. vs. 59.</p>
