  <h2>Citta-Sambhūta Jātaka (No.498)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a 
Candāla in <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a> in the kingdom of 
<a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a>. He was called Citta and his brother 
Sambhūta. One day, when they were out sweeping, two rich women on their way to 
the park noticed them and turned back. Their followers, disappointed at their 
loss of a picnic, beat the two Candālas.  </p>
<p>Then the brothers went to <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> to 
study. Citta became very proficient, and was sent one day, in place of his 
teacher, to the house of a villager who had invited the teacher and his pupils. 
But while there, in a moment of forgetfulness, the brothers used the Candāla 
dialect, and having thus disclosed their caste, were driven out of Takkāsilā.  </p>
<p>In 
their next birth they became does and in a subsequent birth ospreys. They were 
always together and always met their death together. Later Citta was born as the 
son of the chaplain of Kosambī, and Sambhūta as son of the king of 
<a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a>. 
Citta, becoming an ascetic at the age of sixteen, remembered his past births. He 
waited till Sambhūta had reigned for fifty years, and knowing that he also had 
some recollection of his previous existences, taught a stanza to a lad and sent 
him to recite it before the king. Sambhūta heard the stanza, remembered his 
brother, and, after inquiry, visited Citta, who had then gone to the royal park. 
There Citta gave him counsel, and not long after Sambhūta renounced the world. 
After death they were both born in the Brahma world.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with Sambhūta. The 
story was told in reference to two monks, colleagues of Mahā-Kassapa, who were 
greatly devoted to each other. J.iv.390-401.</p>
