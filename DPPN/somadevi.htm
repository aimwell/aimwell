  <h2>Somadevī</h2>

</ul>
<p>Second queen of King Vattagāmani. </p>
<p>During his flight from the Damilas in a chariot, Somadevī, 
finding the chariot too heavy, descended of her own accord and the king gave her 
his diadem jewel. One of the Damila chiefs captured her and took her to India. 
Later, when Vattagāmani recovered his kingdom, he sent for Somadevī, and raising 
her once more to her former rank, built in her name the Somārāma (Manisomārāma).
