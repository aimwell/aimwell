<p>A very rich brahmin once visited the Buddha clad in a 
coarse cloak. When asked why he was thus clothed, he said that his four sons, 
with their wives, had thrown him out of his house. The Buddha taught him a 
series of verses to be recited at the brahmin assembly, when his sons would be 
present. The sons realized their folly and took him home and looked after him 
well. The brahmin went back to thank the Buddha. S.i.175f.</p>
