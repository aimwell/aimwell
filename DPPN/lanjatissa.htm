<p>King of Ceylon (59-50 B.C.). He 
was the eldest son of Saddhātissa, but, when his father died, the ministers and 
monks crowned his younger brother, Thūlatthana, king. Lañjatissa killed 
Thūlatthana after one month, and ruled for nine years and fifteen days. At first 
he was very indifferent towards the monks, but later made amends. He built the 
Arittha and Kuñjarahīnaka vihāras, the Lañjakāsanasālā and a stone mantling for 
the Kanthakathūpa, in addition to other good works. Mhv.xxxiii.14ff.</p>
