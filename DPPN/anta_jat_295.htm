  <h2>Anta Jātaka (No. 295)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Veluvana regarding <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> 
and <a href="kokaalika.htm" title="ku/kokaalika.htm">Kokālika</a>, who were going about singing each other’s praises in order to 
obtain followers. </p>
<p>The story of the past is of a jackal who 
was eating the carcase of a bull. A crow, seeing him, flattered him, hoping to 
get some of the flesh. </p>
<p>The jackal and the crow were Devadatta 
and Kokālika respectively (J.ii.440-1).</p>
