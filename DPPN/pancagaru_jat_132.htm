  <h2>Pañcagaru Jātaka (No. 132) = Bhiruka Jātaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once the youngest of the hundred sons 
of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He had, as far as could be seen, no chance of 
being king, but on seeking the counsel of a Pacceka Buddha and following his 
advice, he became king on his father’s death. For details reference is invited 
to the “Takkasilā Jātaka,” this evidently being another name for the Telapatta 
Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
<p>This Jātaka was related in reference to the attempts made 
by Māra’s daughters to tempt the Buddha as he sat under the Ajapāla nigrodha.
