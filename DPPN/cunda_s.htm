<p>1. Cunda Sutta.-Cunda Kammāraputta 
visits the Buddha in his Mango-grove in Pāvā and questions him as to how many 
classes of recluses there are in the world. Four, answers the Buddha — maggajina, 
maggadesaka, maggajīvī and maggadūsī — and proceeds to explain them 
(SN.vs.83-90; SNA.i.159ff). The circumstances in which the sutta was preached 
are given s.v. Cunda (1).</p>
<p>2. Cunda Sutta (also called Mahā Cunda 
Sutta).-Preached by Mahā Cunda at Sahajātī to the assembled monks. Some, who are 
zealous about the Dhamma, speak disparagingly of those who are given to jhāna 
and vice versa. Sometimes it happens that those who are engaged in the Dhamma 
praise their fellows, and similarly with those devoted to jhāna. None of these 
things are profitable. Dhamma-zealots should learn to praise those eager for 
jhāna and vice versa (A.iii.355f).</p>
<p>3. Cunda Sutta.-Mahā Cunda tells the 
monks at Sahajātī how it is possible to distinguish true statements from false 
when made by a monk about himself and his attainments (A.v.41ff).</p>
<p>4. Cunda Sutta.-Cunda Samanuddesa comes 
to Jetavana from Nālagāmaka, where he had attended Sāriputta during his last 
illness, and reports his death to Ānanda, producing, at the same time, 
Sāriputta’s bowl and outer robe and the water-strainer containing his relies. 
Ānanda accompanies Cunda to the Buddha, where he breaks the news. The Buddha 
praises Sāriputta’s attainments and takes the opportunity of emphasising the 
impermanence of all things. S.v.161ff</p>
