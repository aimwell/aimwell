<p><b>1. Sīha Sutta.</b> When the lion comes from his lair in 
the evening and utters his lion’s roar all the birds and beasts that hear it 
quake and tremble. Similarly when a Buddha appears in the world, all those 
holding wrong beliefs realize their error. The Buddha’s teaching has, as its 
aim, the ending of sakkāya. A.ii.33f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sīha Sutta.</b> Sīha (q.v.), the general, visits the 
Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli and questions him on the visible results of 
giving. A.iii.38f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sīha Sutta.</b> When a lion hunts he hunts 
carefully, be it but for a hare or cat, lest his skill should fail him. 
Similarly, when a Buddha preaches, be it but to a fowler going about with grain, 
he teaches with care, out of respect for the Dhamma. A.iii.121.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sīha Sutta. </b>Very similar to No. 2 above. 
A.iv.79f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sīha Sutta. </b>Describes the conversion of Sīha, 
the general (q.v.) A.iv.180f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sīha Sutta.</b> While the Buddha is preaching to a 
large congregation at Jetavana, Māra approaches and asks him how he can be so 
confident, like to a lion. The Buddha answers that it is because he has won the 
tenfold power. S.i.109.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sīha Sutta.</b> Very similar to No. 1. S.iii.84f.</p>
<hr>
