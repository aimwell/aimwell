  <h2>Tissabhūti</h2>

</ul>
<p>A monk of Mandalārāma in Ceylon, in the 
time of King Vattagāmani (VibhA.448). He was evidently well versed in the 
Abhidhamma and it is said (DhsA.30) that he once explained the Padesavihāra 
Sutta so as to include various teachings of the Abhidhamma.</p>
<p>Once, while on his alms-rounds, he saw 
something which provoked desire in his heart. He immediately returned to his 
teacher and asked his advice as to how to conquer his disease. The teacher sent 
him to Mahāsangharakkhita of Malaya, who gave him the asubhakammatthāna. That 
same night Tissabhūti became an arahant at the foot of a sepanni tree. AA.i.23f.</p>
