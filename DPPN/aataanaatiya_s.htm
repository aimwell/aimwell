  <h2>Ātānātiya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The thirty-second sutta of the <a href="diigha_nikaaya.htm" title="d/diigha_nikaaya.htm">Digha 
Nikāya</a>, preached at the <a href="gijjhakuuta.htm" title="g/gijjhakuuta.htm">Gijjhakūta</a> (D.iii.194ff).</p>
<p>The Four Great Kings (<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cattāro 
Mahārājāno</a>)<b> </b>having set a guard 
over the four quarters, visited the Buddha. Having saluted him and sat down with 
hosts of other <a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkhas</a>, <a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> told the Buddha that the 
Yakkhas did not, for 
the most part, believe in the Buddha for the reason that they did not find it 
pleasant or agreeable to abstain from the things which he declared to be evil — 
such as the taking of life, theft, etc. And in order that the Buddha’s 
disciples, haunting lonely and remote parts of the forest where the Yakkhas 
dwelt, might find protection from them, Vessavana suggested that the Buddha 
might learn the Ātānātiya word-rune (rakkha). The Buddha agreeing, Vessavana 
proceeded to recite it.</p>
<p>It opens with a salutation to the seven 
Buddhas, beginning with <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a>. The remainder contains a list of the gods and 
other superhuman beings, the Four Great Kings heading the list; these last are 
described at some length; forty-one other gods are mentioned as a kind of 
appendix or afterthought, all mentioned one after another with no attempt at 
group division and without any details, in what are, apparently, mnemonic 
doggerels.</p>
<p>A part of the <a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya Sutta</a> (sections 
10-20) looks very much like an improved and enlarged edition of this list of 
bare names.</p>
<p>The Buddha learnt the word-rune and 
taught it to the monks.</p>
<p>The Ātānātiya Sutta is now regarded as a 
<a href="paritta.htm" title="pa/paritta.htm">Paritta</a>, and its influence pervades a hundred 
million world systems (VibhA.430). </p>
<p>In Ceylon, for instance, it is recited with great fervour at the conclusion 
of the Paritta ceremonies, particularly in times of illness, in order to ward 
off evil spirits.</p>
<p>It is included in the list of Parittas 
found in the Milinda-pañha, p.151; on the importance of this sutta in the 
history of India, see Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, pp.219-37.</p>
<p>DA.iii.969 gives a long description of 
the ritual to be followed when reciting the Atānātiya Paritta.</p>
