  <h2>Cūla-kammavibhanga Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Subha Todeyyaputta visits the Buddha at 
Jetavana and asks him why, among mankind, some are high and some low, some 
long-lived and some short, some handsome and some plain, some rich and some 
poor, etc. It is the result of their heritage from the past, answers the Buddha; 
their deeds are their possessions, their parents, their kindred and their 
refuge; he then proceeds to explain in detail (M.iii.202ff). Subha acknowledges 
the Buddha as his teacher. </p>
<p>The Commentary (MA.ii.962) calls this 
the Subha Sutta. For details of the circumstances in which the sutta was 
preached see Subha Todeyyaputta.</p>
