  <h2>Niddesa</h2>

</ul>
<p>A commentarial work included in the Canon as part of the 
<a href="khuddaka_n.htm" title="ku/khuddaka_n.htm">Khuddaka Nikāya</a>. It is generally divided into two books: the Culla-Niddesa and 
the Mahā Niddesa. </p>
<p>The Culla Niddesa contains comments on the <a href="khaggavisaana.htm" title="ku/khaggavisaana.htm">Khaggavisāna 
Sutta</a> and the sixteen suttas of the <a href="parayana.htm" title="pa/parayana.htm">Parāyana Vagga</a> of the 
<a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a>, while 
the Mahā Niddesa deals with the sixteen suttas of the 
<a href="atthaka_s_v.htm" title="ay/atthaka_s_v.htm">Atthaka Vagga</a>. </p>
<p>It is significant that the Culla Niddesa contains no 
comments on the fifty six (Vatthugāthā) introductory stanzas, which preface the 
Parāyana Vagga as at present found in the Sutta Nipāta. This lends support to 
the suggestion that at the time the Culla Niddesa was written the Parāyana 
Vagga, was a separate anthology, and that the Khaggavisāna Sutta did not belong 
to any particular group. Similarly with the Mahā Niddesa and the Atthaka Vagga.
</p>
<p>The comments in the Niddesa seem to have been modeled on 
exegetical explanations such as are attributed here and there in the Pitakas to 
Mahā Kaccāna (E.g., Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.110f); also S.iii.9) and to 
Sāriputta (E.g., Sangitī Sutta, D.iii.207f).</p>
<p>There is a tradition (NidA. p.1), which ascribes the 
authorship of the Niddesa to Sāriputta. There exists a Commentary on it, called 
the Saddhammapajjotikā, by Upasena. It was written in Ceylon at the request of a 
monk called Deva Thera.</p>
