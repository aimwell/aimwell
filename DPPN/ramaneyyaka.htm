<h4>Rāmaneyyaka Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. He belonged to a wealthy family of Sāvatthi, and left the world 
impressed by the presentation of Jetavana. Dwelling in the forest, he practiced 
meditation, and, because of his attainments and charm, he was called Rāmaneyyaka. 
Once Māra tried to frighten him, but without success. The verse he uttered on 
that occasion is included in the Theragāthā (Thag. vs. 49).</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha, he had offered him flowers. Twenty nine kappas 
ago he was king under the name of Sumedhayasa (v.l. Sumeghaghana) 
(ThagA.i.120f). He is probably identical with Minelapupphiya of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.203f.</p>

<h4>Rāmaneyyaka Sutta</h4>
<p>Sakka visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him what it is which, by 
situation, is enjoyable. The Buddha replies that whatever place is occupied by 
the arahants that is the most enjoyable. S.i.232; cp. DhA.ii.195; the verse here 
ascribed to the Buddha is, in the Thag. (vs. 991) attributed to Sāriputta. Both 
there and in DhA. (see above) the verse is uttered in reference to Sāriputta’s 
brother, Revata.</p>
