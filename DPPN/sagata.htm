<p><b>1. Sāgata Thera. </b>He was the personal attendant of 
the Buddha at he time when Sona Kolvisa visited Bimbisāra, with overseers of the 
eighty thousand townships of Bimbisāra’s kingdom. Sāgata was endowed with 
supernatural power, and the overseers, who went to visit the Buddha at 
Gijjhakūta, were very impressed by his iddhi, so much so that even while the 
Buddha was preaching they could not take their eyes off him. The king thereupon 
asked Sāgata to show them a greater marvel, and Sāgata, having shown in the open 
sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha’s feet and declared the Buddha 
his teacher (Vin.i.179 f).</p>
<p>Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatikā, 
having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nāga of great power in 
the Jatila hermitage at Ambatittha, Sāgata went there and lived in the Nāga’s 
abode. The Nāga showed great resentment, but Sāgata overpowered him with his 
iddhi and then returned to Bhaddavatikā. From there he went with the Buddha to 
Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great 
honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, 
but the Chabbaggīyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits (kāpotikā).</p>
<p>The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to 
various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep 
were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the 
gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his 
head at the Buddha’s feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the 
Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an 
example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the 
passing of a rule against the use of alcohol. Vin.iv.108f.; the story: is also 
given as the introduction to the Surāpāna Jātaka (J.i.360 ff.) which, too, was 
preached on this occasion; cf. AA.i.178f.</p>
<p>It is said (AA.i.179) that on the next day, when Sāgata 
came to himself and realized the enormity of his offence, he sought the Buddha 
and, having begged his forgiveness, developed insight, attaining arahantship. 
The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation 
of the heat element (tejodhātukusalānam) (A.i.25).</p>
<p>It is curious that no verses are ascribed to Sāgata in the 
Theragāthā. The Apadāna (Ap.i.83f) contains a set of verses said to have been 
spoken by him. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was Sobhita, a brahmin. The 
Buddha came to his hermitage with his disciples, and Sāgata spoke verses in 
praise of the Buddha, who declared his future destiny. The Commentary adds that 
he was called Sāgata because he was greatly welcome (sāgata) to his parents.</p>
