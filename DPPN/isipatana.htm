<p><b>1. Isipatana.</b>-An open space near 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, the site of the famous Migadāya or Deer Park. It was eighteen leagues 
from <a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a>, and when <a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a> gave up his austere penances his friends, the
<a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiya</a> monks, left him and went to Isipatana (J.i.68). After his 
Enlightenment the Buddha, leaving Uruvela, joined them in Isipatana, and it was 
there that he preached his first sermon, the 
<a href="dhammacakkappavattana.htm" title="d/dhammacakkappavattana.htm">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>, on the 
full-moon day of Āsālha. Vin.i.10f.; on this occasion 80 kotis of Brahmas and 
innumerable gods attained the comprehension of the Truth (Mil.30); (130 kotis 
says Mil.350). The Lal. (528) gives details of the stages of this journey. The 
Buddha, having no money with which to pay the ferryman, crossed the Ganges 
through the air. When <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> heard of this, he abolished the toll for 
ascetics.</p>
<p>There, also, the Buddha spent his first 
rainy season (BuA., p.3).</p>
<p>All the Buddhas preach their first 
sermon at the Migadāya in Isipatana; it is one of the four avijahitatthānāni 
(unchanging spots), the others being the bodhi-pallanka, the spot at the gate of 
Sankassa, where the Buddha first touches the earth on his return from 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>, 
and the site of the bed in the <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a> in 
<a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> (BuA.247; DA.ii.424).</p>
<p>Isipatana is mentioned by the Buddha as 
one of the four places of pilgrimage which his devout followers should visit 
(D.ii.141).</p>
<p>Isipatana was so-called because sages, 
on their way through the air (from the Himalayas), alight here or start from 
here on their aerial flight (isayo ettha nipatanti uppatanti cāti-Isipatanam).</p>
<p>The Migadāya was so-called because deer 
were allowed to roam about there unmolested.</p>
<p>Pacceka Buddhas, having spent seven days 
in contemplation in the <a href="gandhamaadana.htm" title="g/gandhamaadana.htm">Gandhamādana</a>, bathe in the <a href="anotatta.htm" title="ay/anotatta.htm">Anotatta</a> Lake and come to the 
habitations of men through the air, in search of alms. They descend to earth at 
Isipatana (MA.i.387; AA.i.347 adds that sages also held the uposatha at 
Isipatana).</p>
<p>Sometimes the Pacceka Buddhas come to 
Isipatana from <a href="nandamulapabbhara.htm" title="n/nandamulapabbhara.htm">Nandamūlaka-pabbhāra</a> (MA.ii.1019; PsA.437-8).</p>
<p>Several other incidents connected with 
the Buddha, besides the preaching of the first sermon, are mentioned as having 
taken place in Isipatana. Here it was that one day at dawn 
<a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa</a> came to the 
Buddha and became an arahant (Vin.i.15f). It was at Isipatana, too, that the 
rule was passed prohibiting the use of sandals made of talipot leaves 
(Vin.i.189). On another occasion when the Buddha was staying at Isipatana, 
having gone there from <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, he instituted rules forbidding the use of 
certain kinds of flesh, including human flesh (Vin.i.216ff.; the rule regarding 
human flesh was necessary because <a href="suppiyaa.htm" title="s/suppiyaa.htm">Suppiyā</a> made broth out of her own flesh for a 
sick monk). Twice, while the Buddha was at Isipatana, <a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> visited him but had 
to go away discomfited (S.i.105f).</p>
<p>Besides the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta 
mentioned above, several other suttas were preached by the Buddha while staying 
at Isipatana, among them  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the Pañca Sutta (S.iii.66f), </li>
  <li>the Rathakāra or Pacetana 
Sutta (A.i.110f), </li>
  <li>the two Pāsa Suttas (S.i.105f), </li>
  <li>the Samaya Sutta 
(A.iii.320ff), </li>
  <li>the Katuviya Sutta (A.i.279f.), </li>
  <li>a discourse on the Metteyyapañha 
of the Parāyana (A.iii.399f), and </li>
  <li>the Dhammadinna Sutta (S.v.406f), preached to 
the distinguished layman <a href="dhammadinna.htm" title="d/dhammadinna.htm">Dhammadinna</a>, who came to see the Buddha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most eminent members of the 
Sangha seem to have resided at Isipatana from time to time; among recorded 
conversations at Isipatana are several between <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and
<a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahākotthita</a> 
(S.ii.112f;iii.167f;iv.162f; 384ff), and one between Mahākotthita and 
<a href="citta.htm" title="c/citta.htm">Citta-Hatthisāriputta</a> (A.iii.392f).</p>
<p>Mention is made, too, of a discourse in 
which several monks staying at Isipatana tried to help <a href="channa.htm" title="c/channa.htm">Channa</a> in his 
difficulties (S.iii.132f).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="mahavamsa.htm" title="maha/mahavamsa.htm">Mahāvamsa</a>, there was a 
large community of monks at Isipatana in the second century B.C. For, we are 
told that at the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura, twelve 
thousand monks were present from Isipatana led by the Elder Dhammasena 
(Mhv.xxix.31).</p>
<p><a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a> (Beal: Records of the 
Western World, ii.45ff ) found, at Isipatana, fifteen hundred monks studying the 
Hīnayāna. In the enclosure of the Sanghārāma was a vihāra about two hundred feet 
high, strongly built, its roof surmounted by a golden figure of the mango. In 
the centre of the vihāra was a life-size statue of the Buddha turning the wheel 
of the Law. To the south-west were the remains of a stone stupa built by 
<a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a>. 
The Divy. (389-94) mentions Asoka as intimating to Upagupta his desire to visit 
the places connected with the Buddha’s activities, and to erect thupas there. 
Thus he visited Lumbinī, Bodhimūla, Isipatana, Migadāya and Kusinagara; this is 
confirmed by Asoka’s lithic records, e.g. Rock Edict, viii.</p>
<p>In front of it was a stone pillar to 
mark the spot where the Buddha preached his first sermon. Near by was another 
stupa on the site where the Pañcavaggiyas spent their time in meditation before 
the Buddha’s arrival, and another where five hundred Pacceka Buddhas entered 
Nibbāna. Close to it was another building where the future Buddha Metteyya 
received assurance of his becoming a Buddha.</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang quotes the Nigrodhamiga 
Jātaka (J.i.145ff) to account for the origin of the Migadāya. According to him 
the Deer Park was the forest gifted by the king of Benares of the Jātaka, where 
the deer might wander unmolested.</p>
<p>According to the Udapāna Jātaka 
(J.ii.354ff ) there was a very ancient well near Isipatana which, in the 
Buddha’s time, was used by the monks living there.</p>
<p>In past ages Isipatana sometimes 
retained its own name, E.g., in the time of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.18), 
Dhammadassī (BuA.182) and Kassapa (BuA.218). Kassapa was born there (ibid., 
217).</p>
<p>But more often Isipatana was known by 
different names (for these names see under those of the different Buddhas). Thus 
in Vipassī’s time it was known as Khema-uyyāna. It is the custom for all Buddhas 
to go through the air to Isipatana to preach their first sermon. Gotama, 
however, walked all the way, eighteen leagues, because he knew that by so doing 
he would meet Upaka, the Ajivaka, to whom he could be of service (DA.ii.471).</p>
<p>Isipatana is identified with the modern 
Saranath, six miles from Benares. Cunningham (Arch. Reports, i. p. 107) found 
the Migadāya represented by a fine wood, covering an area of about half a mile, 
extending from the great tomb of Dhammek on the north to the Chaukundi mound on 
the south.</p>
