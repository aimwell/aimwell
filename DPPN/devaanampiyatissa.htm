<p>King of Ceylon (247-207 B.C.). He was 
the second son of Mutasīva. It is said that on the day of his coronation many 
wonderful treasures miraculously appeared, some of which he resolved to send as 
tokens of esteem to his contemporary <a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Dhammāsoka</a> of India, with whom he had long 
been on terms of friendship. An embassy, led by his nephew Mahārittha, was 
despatched to <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaliputta</a>, and the emperor showed the ambassadors every mark of 
honour. He sent back with them all the requisites for a coronation, with 
instructions to celebrate the inauguration of the Sinhalese king, whom he 
invited to embrace Buddhism. On the return of the embassy, the king was solemnly 
crowned a second time. This confirmation of Devānampiyatissa’s sovereignty under 
the aegis of Asoka may have been due either to the commanding position of Asoka 
or for the strengthening of family connections. Asoka was a Moriyan (a branch of 
the Sākiyans) and Devānampiyatissa had Sākiyan blood.</p>
<p>The chief event in the reign of 
Devānampiyatissa was the arrival of <a href="mahinda.htm" title="ma/mahinda.htm">Mahinda</a> in Ceylon. He arrived at the head of 
a mission in the year of the king’s second coronation. Mahinda met the king 
hunting on the full-moon day of Jettha. The king welcomed him with great honour 
and speedily embraced the new religion, to which Asoka had already drawn his 
attention.  </p>
<p>His conversion was the direct result of Mahinda’s preaching of the 
Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta. His earlier religion is not known, it may have been 
Jainism. His example was followed by a large number of his subjects, many of 
whom entered the Order. Devānampiyatissa dedicated to their use the Nandana park 
and the Mahāmeghavana, which he himself had laid out a little earlier. In the 
Mahāmeghavana he built the famous Mahā-Vihāra which, for many centuries, 
remained the centre of the orthodox religion in Ceylon. The dedication of the 
Mahā-Vihāra took place in the two hundred and thirty-sixth year after the death 
of the Buddha. The king’s next pious work was the erection of the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra 
and he, later, built the Thūpārāma, containing the Buddha’s right collar-bone.</p>
<p>When the women of the palace, led by 
Anulā, wife of the sub-king, Mahānāga, expressed a desire to become nuns, 
Devānampiyatissa sent another embassy to Asoka asking him to send Sanghamittā, 
together with the right branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree. This branch 
miraculously severed itself from the parent tree and, together with Sanghamittā, 
was conveyed down the Ganges and arrived in Jambukola, where it was received 
with all honour by Devānampiyatissa. From Jambukola it was taken in procession 
to Anurādhapura, where it was planted in the Mahāmeghavana, the king instituting 
in its honour a festival, which was observed for many centuries. For the use of 
Sanghamittā and the nuns the king erected various buildings, the chief of which 
was the Hatthālhaka-vihāra and the Upāsikā-vihāra with its twelve mansions. 
(This account is summarised from the Mahāvamsa (chaps.xi., xiii.-xx.); also 
Dpv.xi.14ff; xii.7; xvii.92).</p>
<p>Among other works of Devānampiyatissa we 
are told of the building of the Issarasamana- and the Vessagiri-vihāras, the 
refectory called Mahāpāli, the Jambukola-vihāra in Nāgadīpa, the Tissamahā-vihāra, 
the Pācīnārāma and the Pathamathūpa. He also built the Tissavāpi at 
Anurādhapura. (The Cv. (xxxvii.94) mentions also the Dhammacakka as having been 
built by Devānampiyatissa. It later became the Temple of the Tooth at 
Anurādhapura).</p>
<p>Mahinda survived him by eight years. 
Devānampiyatissa seems to have died without issue, for he was succeeded by four 
of his brothers.</p>
