<p><a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>, king of Benares, was much addicted to meat. 
One uposatha day the meat which had been prepared for him was eaten by dogs, and 
the cook, unable to buy any more, cut a piece from a human body recently dead 
and cooked it. Brahmadatta had been a <a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkha</a> in a former birth and therefore 
enjoyed the dish. Having discovered what the meat was, he developed a taste for 
human flesh, and, in due course, came to having his subjects murdered in order 
to supply him with food. His crime was discovered and his guilt brought home by 
his commander in chief, <a href="kaalahatthi.htm" title="ka/kaalahatthi.htm">Kālahatthī</a>, but the king refused to give up his 
cannibalism and was driven out of the kingdom. Kālahatthi relates various 
stories to the king, showing the folly of his behaviour 
<span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; e.g., the story of the fish 
Ānanda, of Sujāta’s son, of the geese who lived in Cittakūta and of the Unnābhi<span lang="en-us">
spider.</p>
<p>The king dwelt in the forests with his cooks, eating all 
the travelers they were able to seize. The day arrived when he killed the cook 
himself and ate his flesh. Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling 
through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king. As he 
ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain. Seeing a banyan 
tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one 
princes if his foot were healed in seven days. The foot did heal within that 
time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous 
birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means 
of cords passed through their hands.</p>
<p>The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice of 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context 
Porisāda) and 
demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number 
of his victims. Sutasoma had been the man eater’s friend and private tutor (pitthācariya) 
at Takkasilā. Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma’s 
park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his 
ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa. On the way to the park, Sutasoma 
met a brahmin, <a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda</a>, who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four 
verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha. Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return 
from the park, but there he was caught by the Porisāda. Promising to return to 
the Porisāda, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda. This 
promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Porisāda and went with him to the 
banyan tree. There he told the Porisāda of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, 
reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth. The Porisāda was 
greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons. Sutasoma chose as his first 
boon that the Porisāda should live for one hundred years; as his second that the 
captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be 
restored; and as his fourth that the Porisāda should give up his cannibalism. 
Only very reluctantly did the Porisāda agree to the fourth. Sutasoma then took 
him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured 
the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits. 
Sutasoma then returned to Indapatta. In gratitude for the tree sprite’s 
intervention, a lake was dug near the banyan tree and a village founded near by, 
whose inhabitants were required to make offerings to the tree. This village, 
built on the spot where the Porisāda was converted, came to be called 
Kammāsadamma.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s 
conversion of Angulimāla, with whom the man eater is identified. Kālahatthi was 
Sāriputta, Nanda was Ānanda, the tree sprite was Kassapa, Sakka was Anuruddha, 
and Sutasoma the Bodhisatta. J.v.456 511; cp. Jātakamāla xxxi.</p>
<p>The Sutasomacariyā 
is given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.12.</p>
