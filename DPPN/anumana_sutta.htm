<p>Preached by <a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Mahāmoggallāna</a> in the 
<a href="bhesakalavava.htm" title="b/bhesakalavava.htm">Bhesakalāvana</a> at 
<a href="sumsumaaragiri.htm" title="s/sumsumaaragiri.htm">Sumsumāragiri</a> in the 
<a href="bhagga.htm" title="b/bhagga.htm">Bhagga</a> country. It deals with the 
admonishing of monks and with self-examination. It is of interest to note that 
there is no reference to the Buddha throughout the discourse (M.i.95-100). 
 
</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says that this discourse was known to the Porānā as the 
Bhikkhupātimokkha, and adds that this self-examination should take place three 
times each day (MA.i.294). The description of the evil-minded monk given in the 
sutta is often quoted (E.g., Sp. iii. 612).</p>
