<p>1. Kāmabhū Sutta.-Kāmabhū visits Ānanda 
at Ghositārāma in Kosambī and asks him whether the senses are the bonds of 
objects or objects the bonds of senses. Ānanda answers that neither is true; the 
bond is the desire and lust that arise owing to the senses and the objects with 
which they come in contact. The Buddha, for instance, is free from such bondage 
(S.iv.165).</p>
<p>The same question is asked of Sāriputta 
by Kotthita, who receives the same reply (S.iv.162f).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kāmabhū Sutta.-Cittagahapati visits 
Kāmabhū at Ambātakavana in Macchikāsanda and is asked to solve a riddle:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
  <p>Nelango setapacchādo ekāro vattatī 
  ratho</dd>
  <dd>
  <p>Anīgham passa āyantam chinnasotam 
  abandhanam.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Citta explains this as referring to the 
Arahant and points out the significance of each term (S.iv.291f). In the Udāna 
(p.76; UdA.370f; cf. DhsA.398) the words of the riddle are mentioned as having 
been used by the Buddha in reference to Lakuntaka-Bhaddiya.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Kāmabhū Sutta.-Records another visit 
of Citta to Kāmabhū. Citta asks a series of questions about the activities of 
the body, speech and mind and their cessation. Kāmabhū explains them to Citta’s 
satisfaction. S.iv.293.</p>
