  <h2>Dhovana Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On the difference between the 
purification (dhovana) practised by people of the southern countries and that 
practised by the Ariyans (A.v.216f).</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (AA.ii.858) that 
in the south people do not burn their dead, but bury them. When the corpse has 
decayed, they remove the bones, wash them, arrange them in due order, and, on 
feast days, offer to them flowers and incense and lamentations.</p>
