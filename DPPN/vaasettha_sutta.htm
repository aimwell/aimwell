<p><b>1. Vāsettha Sutta. </b>The young brahmins, Vāsettha and 
<a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja</a>, fell to discussing one day, at 
<a href="iccaananagala.htm" title="i_/iccaananagala.htm">Icchānankala</a>, as to what makes a true 
brahmin. Bhāradvāja maintained that it was pure descent from seven generations 
of ancestors, with neither break nor blemish in the lineage, whereas Vāsettha 
contended that virtue and moral behaviour made a true brahmin. As neither could 
convince the other, they agreed to refer the matter to the Buddha, who said it 
was not birth but deeds which made the true brahmin. M.ii.196ff. The sutta also 
occurs in SN., p.115ff.; many of the verses are included in the Brāhmana Vagga 
of the <a href="dhammapada.htm" title="d/dhammapada.htm">Dhammapada</a>.</p>

<p><b>2. Vāsettha Sutta.</b> The lay disciple Vāsettha visits 
the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> and states that it would be a good 
thing for them, for many a day, if his kinsmen, brahmins, trades folk, labourers, 
etc., kept the uposatha with the eightfold qualifications. The Buddha
agrees, and says, further, that it would be good if not only 
gods and men but even the trees were to keep it. A.iv.258.</p>
