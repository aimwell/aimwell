  <h2>Maccha Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Once, during a tour in Kosala with a large number of 
monks, the Buddha saw a fisherman selling fish. </p>
<p>Sitting down at the foot of a tree by the wayside, the 
Buddha pointed out to the monks how no fisherman enjoyed a happy life because 
his mind was, for ever engaged in slaughter. </p>
<p>It was the same, he said, with those who killed other 
creatures; those guilty of killing would suffer greatly after death. A.iii.301f.</p>
