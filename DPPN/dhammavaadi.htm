<p>A monk who lived in the time of Kassapa 
Buddha.  </p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, another monk, <a href="adhammavaadi.htm" title="am/adhammavaadi.htm">Adhammavādi</a>, was charged with 
having violated the rules of the Vinaya, and Dhammavādi decided against him. 
<p>But Adhammavādi succeeded in getting two others to give a verdict in his favour. 
<p>These two monks were later born as <a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a> and 
<a href="satagira.htm" title="sa/satagira.htm">Sātāgira</a>. SNA.i.195f.<p></p>
