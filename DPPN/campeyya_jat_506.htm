<p>Once the king of Magadha, at constant 
war with the king of Anga, obtaining the help of the Nāga-king who dwelt in the 
river Campā, defeated his rival. Thereafter he held an annual festival in honour 
of the Nāga-king. The Bodhisatta, a very poor man, saw Campeyya’s splendour on 
his way to the feast and longed for a like greatness. As a result, after death, 
he was born in the Nāga world where he became king under the name of Campeyya. 
Realising what had happened, he felt disgust at his position as a Nāga and made 
many attempts to observe religious vows, hoping, in this way, to gain release. 
But he was foiled in his efforts by his consort Sumanā. At last he came to the 
world of men, where he kept fast on certain days, lying on an ant-hill. There he 
was taken captive by a snake charmer who tortured him in various ways and took 
him about, exhibiting him for gain. By certain tokens of which Campeyya had 
earlier warned her, Sumanā knew that her husband had been taken captive and, 
after much searching, she discovered him just as the snake charmer was about to 
give a performance before Uggasena, king of Benares. The whole story was then 
revealed, and the snake charmer set Campeyya free. That Uggasena might be 
convinced of the truth of the story, he was invited to the Nāga-world, where he 
and his retinue were lavishly entertained.</p>
<p>The story was related in connection with 
the observance of uposatha vows. Devadatta was the snake charmer and Sāriputta 
was Uggasena. Rāhulamātā was Sumanā (J.iv.454-68).</p>
<p>The Campeyya-cariyā is included in the 
Cariyāpitaka (p.85f ) in order to illustrate sīlapāramitā.</p>
<p>This Jātaka is often referred to (E.g., 
J.i.45; MA.ii.617) as one of the births in which the Bodhisatta practised sīla 
to perfection.</p>
