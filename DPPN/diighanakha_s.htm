  <h2>Dīghanakha Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Sūkarakhatalena to 
Dīghanakha, who tells the Buddha that no view can satisfy him. The Buddha points 
out to him the need for consistency in outlook and expounds to him his own 
doctrine. Sāriputta is present, fanning the Buddha. At the end of the discourse, 
Sāriputta becomes an arahant and Dīghanakha a sotāpanna (M.i.497ff). Elsewhere 
the sutta is called Vedanāpariggaha. DhA.i.79; ThagA.ii.95; MA.ii.862; AA.i.92, 
321; DA.iii.882.</p>
