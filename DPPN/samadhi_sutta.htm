</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Samādhi Sutta.</b> One who is concentrated is one 
who knows as it really is the arising of the body and the passing away thereof; 
the same with feeling, perception, activities and consciousness. S.iii.13; cf. 
S.v.414; on this sutta see Sylvain Levi, JA.1908, xii.102.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Samādhi Sutta.</b> On the six forms of 
concentration. S.iv.362.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Samādhi Sutta. </b>On four ways of developing 
concentration. A.ii.44f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Samādhi Sutta.</b> On four kinds of people in the 
world: those who gain mental calm but not higher wisdom, those who gain higher 
wisdom but not mental calm, those who gain neither, those who gain both. 
A.ii.92.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Samādhi Sutta.</b> The same as (3), but this sutta 
adds that those who have gained neither one nor both should strive energetically 
to obtain them. A.ii.93.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Samādhi Sutta.</b> The same as (3), but adds a 
description as to how mental calm and insight can be united. A.ii.94.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Samādhi Sutta.</b> On the fivefold knowledge which 
arises in those that are wise and mindful and have developed infinite 
concentration. A.iii.24.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Samādhi Sutta.</b> On five qualities that obstruct 
right concentration&nbsp;&nbsp; sights, sounds, etc. A.iii.137.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Samādhi Sutta.</b> The Buddha explains how a monk 
who has won such concentration as to be unaware of earth, water, etc., yet 
contrives to have perception. A.v.7 f.; cf. A.v.353f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Samādhi Sutta.</b> Ānanda asks the same question, 
as in sutta (8), of Sāriputta, and the latter explains it from his own 
experience in Andhavana. A.v.8f.</p>
