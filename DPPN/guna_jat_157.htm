<p>The Bodhisatta was once a Lion, and one 
day while out hunting he sank into a bog and remained there starving for seven 
days until rescued by a Jackal. To show his gratitude the Lion took the Jackal 
and his wife home with him, and the two animals and their wives lived together, 
the Lion and the Jackal going out together hunting. Later on, the Lioness grew 
jealous of the she-Jackal and tried to frighten her away in the absence of their 
husbands. When the Lion heard of this, he told his wife how the Jackal had 
befriended him in his hour of danger, and thenceforth they all lived happily 
together.</p>
<p>The Jackal is identified with Ānanda.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
gift made by Ānanda. Once, when he had been preaching to the women of Pasenadi’s 
palace, they gave him five hundred new garments which the king had just 
presented to them. The king hearing of this was at first annoyed, but on 
questioning Ānanda he was satisfied that no gift presented to the Sangha could 
ever be wasted. Delighted with this discovery, the king himself gave five 
hundred robes to Ānanda, all of which Ānanda presented to a young monk who was 
very useful and helpful to him. The monk, in his turn, distributed them among 
his fellow celibates, who wondered why Ānanda should have singled out one monk 
as the recipient of his gifts. When the matter was related to the Buddha, he 
assured the monks that the gift was offered to the monk by Ānanda only in return 
for numerous services (J.ii.23ff).</p>
<p>The Jātaka is also called Sīha Jātaka, 
and probably also the Sigāla Jātaka. E.g., in J.ii.314.</p>
