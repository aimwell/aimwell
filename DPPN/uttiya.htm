<p>1. Uttiya, Uttika.-He was the son of a 
brahmin of Sāvatthi. When he came of age, he left the world, seeking “the 
Deathless,” and became a Paribbājaka. One day, on his travels, he came to the 
place where the Buddha was preaching and entered the Order, but because of the 
impurity of his morals he could not win his goal. Seeing other bhikkhus who had 
achieved their object, he asked the Buddha for a lesson in brief. The Buddha 
gave him a short lesson, which he used for his meditations. During these 
meditations he fell ill, but in his anxiety he put forth every effort and became 
an arahant (Thag.v.30; ThagA.i.89f).</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was 
a crocodile in the river Candabhāgā. One day, seeing the Buddha’s desire to 
cross to the other bank, the crocodile offered him its back to sit on and took 
him across.</p>
<p>Seven times he was king of the devas, 
and three times ruler of men (Ap.i.79-80). This Uttiya is evidently identical 
with the thera of the same name mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya. In one sutta 
(S.v.22) the Buddha explains to him, in answer to his question, the character of 
the five sensual elements and the necessity for their abandonment. Elsewhere 
(S.v.166) he is represented as asking the Buddha for a lesson in brief, which 
the Buddha gives him. Dwelling in solitude, he meditates on this and becomes an 
arahant.</p>
<p>Perhaps he is also identical with Uttiya 
Paribbājaka, who is represented in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.v.193ff) as asking 
the Buddha various questions on the duration of the world, etc., and as being 
helped by Ānanda to understand the real import of the Buddha’s answers.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Uttiya Thera.-He was one of four 
companions — the others being Godhika, Subāhu and Valliya — who were born at 
Pāvā as the sons of four Malls-rājās. They were great friends, and once went 
together on some embassy to Kapilavatthu. There they saw the Buddha’s Twin 
Miracle, and, entering the Order, they soon became arahants. When they went to 
Rājagaha, Bimbisāra invited them to spend the rainy season there and built for 
each of them a hut, carelessly omitting, however, to have the huts roofed. So 
the theras dwelt in the huts unsheltered. For a long time there was no rain and 
the king, wondering thereat, remembered his neglect and had the huts thatched, 
plastered and painted. He then held a dedication festival and gave alms to the 
Order. The Elders went inside the huts and entered into a meditation of love. 
Forthwith the sky darkened in the west and rains fell.</p>
<p>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha the 
four were householders and friends; one of them gave to the Buddha a ladleful of 
food, another fell prostrate before the Buddha and worshipped him, the third 
gave him a handful of flowers, while the fourth paid him homage with sumana-flowers.</p>
<p>In Kassapa’s time, too, they were 
friends and entered the Order together. Thag.vv.51-4; ThagA.i.123-6.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Uttiya Thera.-He was a Sākyan of 
Kapilavatthu. When the Buddha visited his kinsmen and showed them his power, 
Uttiya was converted and entered the Order. One day, while begging in the 
village, he heard a woman singing and his mind was disturbed. Checking himself, 
he entered the vihāra much agitated and spent the siesta, seated, striving with 
such earnestness that he won arahantship (Thag.v.99; ThagA.i.202-3).</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a 
householder and gave to the Buddha a bed, complete with canopy and rug.</p>
<p>Twenty kappas ago he was three times 
king under the name of Suvannābha.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Pallankadāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.175).</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Uttiya.-In the Kathāvatthu (i.268) 
mention is made of a householder Uttiya, together with Yasa-Kulaputta and 
Setu-mānava, as having attained arahantship while living amid the circumstances 
of a layman’s life.</p>
<hr>
<p>5. Uttiya.-One of the theras who 
accompanied Mahinda on his mission to Ceylon (Mhv.xii.8; Dpv.xii.12; Sp.i.70; 
Mbv.116). King Sirimeghavanna had an image of Uttiya made and placed in the 
image house which he built at the south-eastern corner of his palace. 
Cv.xxxvii.87.</p>
<hr>
<p>6. Uttiya.-King of Ceylon for ten years 
(207-197 B.C.) (Dpv.xii.75; Mhv.xx.57). He was the fourth son of Mutasīva and 
succeeded Devānampiyatissa. In the eighth year of his reign died Mahinda 
(Mhv.xx.33), and in the ninth, Sanghamittā (Mhv.xx.49). He held great 
celebrations in honour of these two illustrious dead and built thūpas in various 
places over their ashes. The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.253) adds that Uttiya built a 
cetiya at the Somanassamālaka.</p>
<hr>
<p>7. Uttiya.-One of the seven warriors of 
King Vattagāmanī. He built the Dakkhina-vihāra to the south of Anurādhapura. 
Mhv.xxxiii.88.</p>
