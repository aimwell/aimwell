<ul>
  <li>
  <h2>Udāna</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A short collection of eighty stories, in 
eight vaggas, containing solemn utterances of the Buddha, made on special 
occasions. The Udāna proper, comprising the Buddha’s utterances, is mostly in 
verse, in ordinary metres (Sloka, Tristubh, Jagatī), seldom in prose (E.g., 
iii.10; viii.1, 3, 4). Each Udāna is accompanied by a prose account of the 
circumstances in which it was uttered. </p>
<p>The book forms the third division of the 
Khudda-kanikāya (DA.i.17; but see p.15, where it is the seventh). </p>
<p>Udāna is also the name of a portion of 
the Pitakas in their arrangement according to matter (anga). Thus divided, into 
this category fall eighty-two suttas, containing verses uttered in a state of 
joy (DA.i.23-4; see also UdA. pp.2-3). </p>
<p>The prose-and-verse stories of the Udāna 
seem to have formed the model for the Dhammapada Commentary (See Bud. Legends, 
i.28). </p>
<p>The Udāna is also the source of twelve 
stories of the same Commentary and contains parallels for three others. About 
one-third of the Udāna is embodied in these stories. See, ibid., i.47-8, for 
details.</p>
