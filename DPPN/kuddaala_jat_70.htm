<p>The Bodhisatta was once a gardener in 
Benares, and because his only possession was a spade (kuddāla) he was known as 
Kuddāla Pandita. Later he became a recluse, but six times thoughts of his spade 
drew him back to the world. The seventh time he threw the spade into the river 
and shouted for joy, winning insight. The king of Benares heard his shouts, and 
on knowing the reason for them, resolved to join Kuddāla as an anchorite. When 
the news spread, the people from twelve leagues round accompanied them, and 
Sakka sent Vissakamma to erect monasteries for them in the Himālaya.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Citta-Hatthisāriputta (q.v.) (J.i.311ff). The names of some of those who 
accompanied Kuddāla in his renunciation are mentioned at the end of the 
Hatthipāla (J.iv.490) and the Mūgapakkha Jātaka. J.vi.30.</p>
<p>The same story is given in different 
words in the Dammapada Commentary (DhA.i.311f).</p>
