<p><b>1. Sālha, </b>called Migāranattā. He once visited 
Nandaka Thera with Pekkhuniya’s grandson, Rohana. See the Sālha Sutta (A.i.193 
f). He built a vihāra for the nuns and Sundarīndā was appointed to supervise the 
work. As a result, Sālha and Sundarīnandā saw each other frequently and fell in 
love. Wishing to seduce her, Sālha invited a party of nuns to his house and set 
apart seats for those nuns who were older than Nandā in one part, and for those 
younger in another, so that Nandā would be alone. But she, guessing the reason 
for the invitation, did not go, and, instead, sent an attendant nun to Sālha’s 
house for her alms, excusing herself on the plea that she was taken ill. Salha, 
hearing of this, set a servant to look after the other nuns and ran off to the 
monastery. Nandā, on her bed, was waiting for him, and he seduced her 
(Vin.iv.211f). Buddhaghosa explains (Sp.iv.900) that Sālha was called 
Migāranattā because he was the grandson of Migaramātā, (Visākhā).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sālha.</b> A Licchavi, who once visited the Buddha 
at the Kūtāgārasālā (A.ii.200). See Salha Sutta (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sālha. </b>A monk of Ñātikā. The Buddha declared 
that he died an arahant. D.ii.191; S.v.356.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sālha.</b> An eminent monk who took a prominent part 
in the Second Council. He lived in Sahajāti, and, on hearing of the heresy of 
the Vajjiputtakas, retired into solitude in order to decide whether he thought 
their contentions right. There an inhabitant of the Suddhāvāsā informed him that 
the Vajjiputtakas were wrong. He was one of the four appointed on behalf of the 
Pācinakas (Vajjiputtakas) on the committee which discussed the dispute. He was a 
pupil of Ānanda. Vin.ii.302ff.; Mhv.iv.4f , 48, 57; Dpv.iv.49; v.22; Sp.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Sālha Sutta.</b> Records a conversation between 
Nandaka Thera, Sālha Migāranatti, and Rohana Pekkhuniyanattā. A.i.193f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sālha Sutta.</b> The Licchavis, Sālha and Abhaya, 
visit the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and question him regarding the way that is 
made by purity of morals and that made by self mortification. The Buddha answers 
the question with many similes. The last part of the sutta describes a fighting 
man who is a “long distance shooter,” one who shoots by lightning, and a smasher 
of large objects, and the corresponding classes of the Ariyan disciples. 
A.ii.200f.</p>
