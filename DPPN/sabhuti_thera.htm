<p>He was the son of Sumanasetthī and the younger brother of 
Anāthapindika. On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha 
preach and left the world. After ordination he mastered the two categories (of 
Vinaya rules), and, after obtaining a subject for meditation, lived in the 
forest. There he developed insight, and attained arahantship on the basis of 
mettā-jhāna. Teaching the Dhamma without distinction or limitation, he was 
declared chief of those who lived remote and in peace (aranavihārinam aggo), and 
of those who were worthy of gifts (dakkhineyyānam) (A.i.24; cf. Ud.vi.7, where 
the Buddha commends his proficiency in meditation). It is said that when he went 
begging for alms he would develop mettā-jhāna at each door, hence every gift 
made to him was of the highest merit. In the course of his travels he came to 
Rājagaha, and Bimbisāra promised to build him a dwelling-place. But the king 
forgot his promise, and Subhūti meditated in the open air. There was no rain, 
and, discovering the cause, the king had a leaf hut built for him. As soon as 
Subhūti entered the hut and seated himself cross legged on the bed of hay, rain 
began to fall.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he belonged to a rich 
family and was called Nanda. Later he left the world and lived the hermit’s 
life, at the head of forty four thousand others. The Buddha visited Nanda’s 
hermitage and accepted from him a gift of fruit and flowers. He asked one of his 
monks, proficient in mettā and eminent in receiving gifts, to preach the 
anumodanā. At the end of the sermon all the other hermits became arahants, but 
Nanda’s attention was fixed on the majesty of the preaching monk, and he did not 
reach any attainment. Later, discovering the qualities in which the preacher had 
attained eminence, Nanda resolved that he too would reach similar eminence. 
AA.i.124f.; ThagA.i.17ff.; UdA.348f; see also Ap.i.67f., where Nanda is called 
Kosiya.</p>
<p>Verses attributed to him are included in the Theragāthā 
(vs.1) and also in the Milinda-Pañha (pp.356,391). See also Subhūti Sutta.</p>
