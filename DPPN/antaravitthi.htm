<p>One of the villages given by Vijayabāhu 
I. to the Lābhavāsī monks. It was situated in Rājarattha not far from 
Pulatthipura (Cv.lx.68), probably between that town and Kotthasāra. It is 
mentioned in an account of battles which apparently took place in the 
neighbourhood of Pulatthipura. Ibid., lxi.46; lxx.322; see also Cv. trans. 
i.221, n.4, and 229. n.2.</p>
