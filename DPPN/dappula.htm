<hr>
<p>1. Dappula.-Second son of Mahātissa and 
Sanghasivā, his brothers being Aggabodhi and Maniakkhika. Among his sons was 
Mānavamma, and it was with his help that he became King Dappula I. on the death 
of Kassapa II. But he reigned in Anurādhapura for only seven days, after which 
Hatthadātha (Dāthopatissa II.) captured the throne. Dappula thereupon retired to 
Rohana and ruled as king there for three years (650-3 A.C.). His wife was the 
daughter of Silādātha (Silāmeghavanna) (Cv.xlv, 16-22, 36ff, 51ff). Dappula was 
a very pious follower of the Buddha and erected many vihāras, repaired others, 
and made an image of Metteyya, fifteen cubits high. (For details of his doings 
see Cv.xli.53ff). He died from grief at the death of his son Mānavamma, who was 
killed by Hatthadātha.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Dappula.-Nephew of Aggabodhi VI. When 
Mahinda II. succeeded Aggabodhi VII. Dappula rose against him, but, in spite of 
several attempts, failed to overcome him. He thereupon retired to Rohana where 
he ruled, having formed a treaty with Mahinda. Some time later, he made another 
attempt to win the throne and fought to fierce battle at Mahāummāra, where he 
was defeated and forced to flee (CV.xlviii.90, 98, 109, 122, 125, 131, 155f).</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Dappula.-Younger brother of Aggabodhi 
VIII., whom he succeeded to the throne as Dappula II, (812 — 28 A.C.). He had a 
senāpati called Vajira and a daughter named Devā. His sister was married to 
Mahinda, ruler of Rohana, and Dappula adopted Mahinda’s sons when they were 
driven away by their father. Dappula rebuilt the Hatthikucchi°, Vāhadīpa° and 
Lāvarāvapabbata-vihāras, and enlarged the Mahāpāli Hall, in addition to various 
other acts of piety. Cv.xlix.65.</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Dappula.-A nephew of King Dappula II. 
and brother of Kittaggabodhi (Cv.xlix.72).</p>
<hr>
<p>5. Dappula.-Yuvarājā of Kassapa V., and 
afterwards his successor as Dappula III. He reigned for only seven months (in 
923 A.C.) (Cv.lii.42; liii.1).</p>
<hr>
<p>6. Dappula.-Yuvarājā of Dappula III. and 
afterwards king, Dappula IV. (923-34 A.C.). During his reign the Pandu king came 
to Ceylon to seek his help against the Colas. Dappula was willing to help him 
but was opposed by his mother. Dappula’s commander was Rakkhaka Ilanga, who 
built a dwelling called after the king. Cv.liii.4-12.</p>
