<p>The Bodhisatta was born as a brahmin in 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and became an ascetic. In the course of his wanderings he once travelled 
with a merchant caravan. The caravan halted for the night, but while the 
merchants slept, the ascetic spent his time pacing up and down. Robbers, coming 
to plunder the caravan, were prevented from so doing by the watchfulness of the 
ascetic. The next day the merchants, discovering what had happened, asked him if 
he had felt no fear at the sight of the robbers. “The sight of robbers causes 
what is known as fear only to the rich. I am penniless, why should I be afraid?” 
he answered.</p>
<p>After death he was born in the Brahma 
world.</p>
<p>The story was told to an upāsaka of 
Sāvatthi who had likewise prevented a caravan from being robbed. “In guarding 
himself a man guards others; in guarding others he guards himself.” J.i.332-4.</p>
