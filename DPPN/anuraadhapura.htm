<p>The capital of Ceylon for nearly fifteen 
centuries. It was built on the site of settlements started by the two Anurādhas 
on the bank of the Kadamba river, and was founded under the constellation 
Anurādha, hence the name. MT.293; Mhv.x.76; this tradition seems to have been 
forgotten later, for in the Mbv. (116) there is a suggestion that the city was 
so called because it was the dwelling of satisfied people (anurodhijana); or is 
this mere alliteration?</p>
<p>Pandukābhaya (394-307 B.C.) was the 
founder of the city, to which he removed the capital from Upatissagāma 
(Mhv.x.75-7), and there it remained up to the time of Aggabodhi IV. (A.D. 
626-41). After a short period it became once more the capital, and continued to 
be so until the royal residence was removed elsewhere (see Cv.xlvi.34, where the 
new capital, Pulatthinagara, is first mentioned as a royal residence). It was 
finally deserted in the eleventh century.</p>
<p>Pandukābhaya beautified the city with 
the artificial lakes Jayavāpi and Abhayavāpi. It was round the last-named lake 
that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special 
villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples to various pagan deities and 
residences for the engineer and other officials. Abodes were also provided for 
devotees of various sects, such as the Jainas, the Ajīvakas, wandering monks and 
brahmins. There were also hospitals and lying-in homes. Guardians of the city (Nagaraguttikā) 
were appointed, one for the day and another for the night. For a full 
description see Mhv.x.80-102.</p>
<p>Pandukābhaya’s son and successor, 
Mutasiva, laid out the beautiful Mahāmegha Park with fruit and flowering trees 
(Mhv.xi.2); this was to the south of the city; between it and the southern wall 
of the city was another park called Nandana or Jotivana (Mhv.xv.2, 11).</p>
<p>In the reign of Piyatissa, who succeeded 
Mutasiva (when Buddhism had been introduced into the land), the king, together 
with his nobles and people, erected many noble edifices in support of the new 
religion. Ten of the most noted were in Anurādhapura (for list see Mhv.xx.17ff), 
and the Mahāmeghavana, which was given over to the Buddhist Sangha, henceforth 
became the centre of Buddhism in the island. In this park was also planted, by 
Piyatissa, the branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree which came from Gayā (for details 
see Mhv.xviii. and xix).</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the city was taken by 
the Tamils but was recaptured by Dutthagāmani (101-77 B.C.), the hero of the 
Mahāvamsa. Many chapters of the chronicle are devoted to descriptions of the 
numerous buildings erected by him in Anurādhapura for the glorification of the 
national faith (Mhv. xxvi.-xxxvi), chief among them being the Maricavatti-vihāra, 
the Lohapāsāda and the Mahā Thūpa.</p>
<p>A few years later the Tamils once more 
overcame the city and held it till Vattagāmani (29-17 B.C.) drove them off. In 
his reign was built the mighty Abhayagiri Thūpa and the vihāra attached to it 
(Mhv.xxxiii.80-3).</p>
<p>The subsequent history of the city is a 
record of how succeeding kings repaired, added to, or beautified, these various 
monuments and the steps they took for their preservation. The only later 
monument of real importance is the Jetavanārāma built by King Mahāsena 
(Mhv.xxxvii.33f ) (A.D. 334-61).</p>
<p>About this time the fame of Anurādhapura 
as the chief centre of Buddhist culture attracted many visitors from abroad in 
search of learning. The most famous of these was the great commentator 
Buddhaghosa (Mhv.xxxvii.215ff.; also Fa Hien). It was also during this period 
that Dhātusena (A.D. 460-78) reorganised the water supply of the city and built 
the Kālavāpi (Mhv.xxxviii.42).</p>
<p>From this time onward the country 
suffered from a series of dynastic intrigues and civil wars, each party 
appealing to the Tamils of South India for help and protection. As a result, the 
district round Anurādhapura was overrun by Tamil freebooters and became 
impossible to defend; the seat of government was therefore removed to 
Pulatthipura about the beginning of the ninth century, where it continued, 
except for a brief interval to the eleventh century. Finally, about A.D. 1300, 
at a date not exactly known, the whole district was abandoned, having become a 
kind of no-man’s land; it then rapidly relapsed into jungle. For quite a long 
time, however, and even after Pulatthipura became the state capital, 
Anurādhapura was regarded as a centre of religious activity, and its monuments 
were restored from time to time (Mhv.lxxvi.106-20; lxxviii.96f.; xxxxviii.80f.</p>
<p>Various scraps of information regarding 
Anurādhapura and its inhabitants are found scattered in the commentaries. E.g., 
that it had two indakhīlas (Sp.iii.299); its main street ran from Thūpārāma, 
where the chief entrance to the city lay (UdA.238; DA.ii.573).</p>
<p>It was famous throughout Jambudīpa for 
its virtuous monks, and men came from there to visit them. E.g., the brahmin who 
came from Pātaliputta to see Mahānāga Thera (AA.i.384).</p>
<p>The city wall, which existed at the time 
the Mahāvamsa was written, had been built by King Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.97), 
and was, according to the Tīkā (p. 654), eighteen 
cubits in height.</p>
