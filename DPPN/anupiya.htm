<p>A township in the Malla country to the 
east of Kapilavatthu. In the mango grove there (the Anupiya-ambavana) the 
Buddha, having arrived from Anomā and having ordained himself, spent the first 
week after his renunciation, before going to Rājagaha, thirty leagues away 
(J.i.65-6). He went there again after his return from Kapilavatthu, whither he 
had gone to see his relations, and large numbers of Sākiyan princes joined the 
Order, including Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and 
their barber, Upāli (Vin.ii.180f.; AA.i.108; DhA.i.133; iv.127).</p>
<p>It was during this stay that the Buddha 
preached the Sukhavihāri Jātaka (J.i.140). From Anupiya the Buddha went to 
Kosambi (Vin.ii.184). Near Anupiya was the pleasaunce where the paribbājaka of 
the Bhaggavagotta lived. The Buddha visited him once while staying at Anupiya 
and it was then that he preached the Pātika Sutta (D.iii.1ff).</p>
<p>Anupiya was the birthplace of Dabba 
Mallaputta. ThagA.i.41; the Ap., however, says Kusinārā (ii.473).</p>
<p>Once when Sona Potiriyaputta was 
meditating the Buddha sent forth a ray of glory from the mango grove to 
encourage him (ThagA.i.316).</p>
<p>The mango grove belonged to the 
Malla-rājās; they built a vihāra therein for the Buddha’s residence (UdA.161; 
DA.iii.816).</p>
<p>The name is sometimes spelt Anopiya and 
Anūpiya (J.i.140). See also Anomā.</p>
