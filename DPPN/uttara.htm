<hr>
<p><b>1. Uttara.</b>-A thera. He was the son of an 
eminent brahmin of Rājagaha (of Sāvatthi, according to the Apadāna). He became 
proficient in Vedic lore and renowned for his breeding, beauty, wisdom and 
virtue. The king’s minister, Vassakāra, seeing his attainments, desired to marry 
him to his daughter; but Uttara, with his heart set on release, declined, and 
learnt the Doctrine under Sāriputta. Later he entered the Order and waited on 
Sāriputta.</p>
<p>One day Sāriputta fell ill and Uttara 
set out early to find a physician. On the way he set down his bowl by a lake and 
went down to wash his mouth. A certain thief, pursued by the police, dropped his 
stolen jewels into the novice’s bowl and fled. Uttara was brought before 
Vassakāra who, to satisfy his grudge, ordered him to be impaled. The Buddha, 
seeing the ripeness of his insight, went to him and placing a gentle hand, “like 
a shower of crimson gold,” on Uttara’s head, spoke to him and encouraged him to 
reflection. Transported with joy and rapture at the Master’s touch, he attained 
sixfold abhiññā and became arahant. Rising from the stake, he stood in mid-air 
and his wound was healed. Addressing his fellow-celibates, be told them how, 
when he realised the evils of rebirth, he forgot the lesser evil of present pain 
(Thag.vv.121-2; ThigA.i.240ff).</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha, he bad 
been a Vijjādhara. Once, while flying through the air, he saw the Buddha at the 
foot of a tree in the forest and, being glad, offered him three kanikāra 
flowers.</p>
<p>By the Buddha’s power, the flowers stood 
above him forming a canopy. The Vijjādhara was later born in Tāvatimsa, where 
his palace was known as Kanikāra.</p>
<p>He was king of the gods one hundred and 
five times, and king of men one hundred and three times.</p>
<p>According to the Apadāna (quoted in 
ThigA.), he became an arahant at the age of seven. This does not agree with the 
rest of the story and is probably due to a confusion with some other Uttara.</p>
<p>Uttara is probably to be identified with 
Tīnikpikārapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.441ff. Ras.i.52f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Uttara.</b>-A thera. He was the son of a 
brahmin of Sāketa. While on some business at Sāvatthi, he saw the Twin Miracle 
and, when the Buddha preached the Kālakārāma Sutta at Sāketa, he entered the 
Order. He accompanied the Buddha to Rājagaha and there became an arahant 
(Thag.vv.161-2; ThagA.i.283f).</p>
<p>During the time of Siddhattha Buddha he 
had been a householder and became a believer in the Buddha. When the Buddha 
died, he called together his relations and together they paid great honour to 
the relics.</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with 
Dhātupūjaka of the Apadāna (ii.425).</p>
<p>It is probably this thera who is 
mentioned in the Uttara Sutta (A.iv.162ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Uttara</b>.-A devaputta who visits the 
Buddha at the Anjanavana in Sāketa. He utters a stanza, and the Buddha, in 
another stanza, amplifies what he has said. S.i.54.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Uttara.</b>-A thera. At the time of the 
<a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjian</a> heresy, he was the attendant of the Elder 
<a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Revata</a> and had been twenty 
years in the Order. The Vajjians of Vesāli went to him and, after much 
persuasion, succeeded in getting him to accept one robe from them.  </p>
<p>In return for 
this he agreed to say before the Sangha that the Pācīnaka Bhikkhus held the true 
Doctrine and that the Pātheyyaka monks did not. Thereafter Uttara went to Revata, 
but Revata, on hearing what he had done, instantly dismissed him from attendance 
upon him. When the Vesāli monks were informed of the occurrence, they took the 
nissaya from Uttara and became his pupils. Vin.ii.302-3; Mhv.iv.30.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Uttara</b>.-An arahant. He, with Sona, 
was sent by Asoka, at the conclusion of the Third Council, to convert 
Suvannabhūmi. They overcame the female demon and her followers, who had, been in 
the habit of coming out of the sea to eat the king’s sons, and they then recited 
the Brahmajāla Sutta. Sixty thousand people became converts, five hundred 
noblemen became monks and fifteen hundred women of good family were ordained as 
nuns.</p>
<p>Thenceforth all princes born in the 
royal household were called Sonuttara. Mhv.iv.6; 44-54; Sp.i.68f; Mbv.115; The 
Dipavamsa speaks of Sonuttara as one person (viii.10).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Uttara.</b>-A brahmin youth (Uttara-mānava), 
pupil of Pārāsariya. He once visited the Buddha at Kajaligalā in the Mukheluvana 
and the Buddha preached to him the Indriya-bhāvanā Sutta (M.iii.298ff).</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this same mānava that is 
mentioned in the Pāyāsi Sutta. When Pāyāsi Rājañña was converted by Kumāra 
Kassapa, he instituted almsgiving to all and sundry, but the gifts he gave 
consisted of such things as gruel and scraps of food and coarse robes. Uttara, 
who was one of his retainers, spoke sarcastically of Pāyāsi’s generosity, and on 
being challenged by Pāyāsi to show what should be done, Uttara gave gladly and 
with his own hands excellent foods and garments. As a result, after death, while 
Pāyāsi was born only in the empty Serisakavimāna of the Cātummahārājika world, 
Uttara was born in Tāvatimsa. D.ii.354-7; see also VvA.297f. where the details 
are slightly different.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Uttara</b>.-A youth of Kosambī, son of a 
minister of King Udena. When his father died, the youth was appointed by the 
king to carry out certain works in the city which his father had left 
unfinished.</p>
<p>One day, while on his way to the forest 
to fell timber, he saw Mahā Kaccana and, being pleased with the thera’s 
demeanour, went and worshipped him. The thera preached to him, and the youth 
invited him and his companions to a meal in his house. At the conclusion of the 
meal Uttara followed Mahā Kaccāna to the vihāra and asked him to have his meals 
always at his house. He later became a Sotāpanna and built a vihāra. He 
persuaded most of his relations to join in his good deeds, but his mother 
refused to help and abused the monks. As a result she was born in the peta-world. 
(See Uttaramātā). PvA.140ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Uttara.</b>-A brahmin youth. When 
Erakapatta, king of the Nāgas, offered his daughter’s hand to anyone who could 
answer his questions — hoping thereby to hear of a Buddha’s appearance in the 
world — Uttara was among those who aspired to win her. The Buddha, wishing for 
the welfare of many beings, met Uttara on his way to the Nāga court and taught 
him the proper answers to the questions. At the end of the lesson, Uttara became 
a Sotāpanna. When he repeated the answers before the Nāga maiden, Erakapatta was 
greatly delighted and accompanied him to the Buddha, who preached to him and to 
the assembled multitude. DhA.iii.230ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Uttara.</b>-A pupil of Brahmāyu. He was 
sent by his teacher from Mithilā to Videha, to find out if the Buddha bore the 
marks of the Super man. Having made sure of the presence of all the thirty-two 
marks on the Buddha’s person, he dogged the Buddha’s footsteps for seven months, 
in order to observe his carriage in his every posture. At the end of that 
period, he returned to Brahmāyu and reported what he had seen (M.ii.134ff; 
SnA.i.37). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.765) that Uttara became known as 
Buddhavīmamsaka-mānava on account of his close watch over the Buddha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Uttara.</b>-A youth, evidently a 
personal attendant of Pasenadi. The Buddha taught him a stanza to be recited 
whenever the king sat down to a meal. The stanza spoke of the merits of 
moderation in eating. DhA.iv.17; but see S.i.81-2 for a different version of 
what is evidently the same incident. There the youth is called Sudassana.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Uttara.</b>-A royal prince to whom Konāgamana Buddha preached at Surindavatī on the full-moon day of Māgha. He 
later became the Buddha’s aggasāvaka. Bu.xxiv.22; BuA.215; J.i.43.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Uttara.</b>-Younger brother of Vessabhū 
Buddha. The Buddha preached his first sermon to Uttara and Sona at the Aruna 
pleasaunce near Anupama. Later Uttara became the Buddha’s aggasāvaka. 
Bu.xxii.23; BuA.205; J.i.42; D.ii.4.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Uttara.</b>-Son of Kakusandha Buddha in 
his last birth. Bu.xxiii.17.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>14. Uttara.</b>-The name of the Bodhisatta 
in the time of Sumedha Buddha. He spent eighty crores in giving alms to the 
Buddha and the monks and later joined the Order. J.i.37-8; Bu.xii.11.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>15. Uttara.</b>-A khattiya, father of 
Mangala Buddha. Bu.iv.22; J.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>16. Uttara</b>.-Son of Padumuttara Buddha in 
his last birth (Bu.xi.21). He was the Bodhisatta. SA.ii.67; DA.ii.488; but see 
J.i.37 and Bu.xi.11, where the Bodhisatta’s name is given as the Jatila Ratthika.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>17. Uttara.</b>-Nephew of King Khallatanāga 
of Ceylon. He conspired with his brothers to kill the king, and when the plot 
was discovered committed suicide by jumping on to a pyre. MT.612.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>18. Uttara.</b>-A banker, a very rich man of 
Sāvatthi. He had a son, designated as Uttara-setthi-putta, whose story is given 
in the Vattaka Jātaka. J.i.432ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>19. Uttara.</b>-The city in which Mangala 
Buddha was born. Bu.iv.22; J.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>20. Uttara.</b>-The city of King Arindama. 
Revata Buddha preached there to the king and the assembled multitude. BuA.133.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>21. Uttara</b>.-A township (nigama), near 
which Revata Buddha spent seven days, wrapt in meditation. At the conclusion of 
his meditation, the Buddha preached to the assembled multitude on the virtues of 
nirodhasamāpatti. BuA.133-4. This may be the same as No. 20.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>22. Uttara.</b>-One of the palaces occupied 
by Paduma Buddha before his Renunciation. Bu.ix.17.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>23. Uttara.</b>-A township of the Koliyans.
