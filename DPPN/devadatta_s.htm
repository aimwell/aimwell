<hr>
<p><b>1. Devadatta Sutta</b>.-Preached to the 
monks at Gijjhakūta soon after Devadatta left the Order. Love of gain, favours 
and flattery came upon Devadatta for his undoing, like fruit to a plaintain or a 
bamboo tree, etc. A.ii.73; see No.3 below; cp. Vin.ii.187f and S.ii.242.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Devadatta Sutta.</b>-Preached in the same 
circumstances as the above. It gives eight reasons for Devadatta’s downfall, and 
urges upon the monks the necessity for reflection on the good and bad fortune 
which overtake oneself and others from time to time. A.iv.160f; cp. Vin.ii.202.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Devadatta Sutta.</b>-Brahmā Sahampati 
visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta soon after Devadatta had left the Order, and 
utters the stanza contained in No.1 above. S.i.153.</p>
