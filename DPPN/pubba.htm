<p><b>1. Pubba (or Hetu) Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells the 
monks of how, even before the Enlightenment, he cultivated the four iddhipādas, 
and of how their development brought various attainments, such as clairvoyance, 
etc. S.v.263 ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Pubba (or Pariyesanā) Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells 
the Monks how, before his Enlightenment, he wondered as to what was the 
satisfaction in the world, what its misery and what the escape therefrom, and 
how, in the end, he thoroughly comprehended all these. A.i.258f.</p>
