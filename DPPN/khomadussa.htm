<p>A (brahmin?) township in the Sākyan 
country. The Buddha once stayed there and preached to an assembly of brahmin 
householders. It is said that the brahmins were at first hostile to the Buddha, 
but that he won them over (S.i.184).</p>
<p>The village was so called because of the 
preponderance (ussannatā) of khomadussā (linen cloth). SA.i.207.</p>
