<h4>Pahārāda </h4>
<p>An Asura chief (D.ii.259). Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.758) he 
was one of the three leaders of the Asuras, the others being Vepacitti and Rāhu. 
He first conceived a wish to see the Buddha on the day of the Enlightenment; but 
this wish was not fulfilled until eleven years later, when he visited the Buddha 
at Verañjā. The conversation which then took place is recorded in the Pahārāda 
Sutta (q.v.).</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pahārāda Sutta</h4>
<p>Preached at the Nalerupucimandamūla in Verañjā where 
Pahārāda (q.v.) visited the Buddha. In answer to a question, Pahārāda tells the 
Buddha that there are eight wonderful characteristics of the ocean, on account 
of which Asuras delight in it. The Buddha tells him of eight similar qualities 
in his own teaching and discipline, wherefore monks find joy in them.
