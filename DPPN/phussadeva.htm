<h4>1. Phussadeva</h4>
<p>One of the two chief disciples of Dhammadassī Buddha. 
J.i.39; Bu.xvi.18.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Phussadeva Thera</h4>
<p>An eminent teacher of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3) in Ceylon. He 
was a contemporary of Upatissa, from whose views his own often differed. See 
Sp.i.263; ii.456, 495; iii. 651, 653; iv. 890.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Phussadeva Thera</h4>
<p>An incumbent of Katakandhakāra in Ceylon. He was among 
those taking part in the assemblies mentioned in Kuddālaka, Mūgapakkha, Ayoghara 
and Hatthipāla Jātakas (J.iv. 490; vi. 30). Once Māra, assuming the form of the 
Buddha, tried to tempt him, but the Elder, seeing this form and deriving joy 
from its contemplation, became an arahant. Vsm. 263.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Phussadeva</h4>
<p>One of the chief warriors of Dutthagāmanī. He was born in 
the village of Gavita and his father was Uppala. Once, having gone to the vihāra 
with other boys, he saw a conch shell offered at the bodhi tree and blew on it. 
All those who heard him stood as if stunned, and he came to be called Ummāda 
Phussadeva. His father was an archer, and he himself became very skilled in this 
art (Mhv.xxiii.82f), the best archer in the island (Mhv.xxv.82). In 
Dutthagāmanī’s fight with Bhalluka, Phussadeva sat behind the king on the 
elephant and shot Bhalluka. His arrow grazed the king’s ear, causing the blood 
to flow. In expiation, Phussadeva cut off the lobe of his own ear and showed it 
to the king. Later the king planted Phussadeva’s arrow on the floor, and 
covering it to its full height with kahāpanas, gave the money to Phussadeva.
