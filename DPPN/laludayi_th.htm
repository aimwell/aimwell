<p>An Elder who possessed the knack of saying “the wrong 
thing.” He would go to a place where people were enjoying a holiday and recite 
stanzas suitable to a funeral and vice versa (DhA.iii.123ff). When the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> 
heard of this he related the <a href="somadatta_jat_211_410.htm" title="s/somadatta_jat_211_410.htm">Somadatta Jātaka</a>, showing that in past 
births, too, Lāludayī had possessed the same propensity. He is identified with 
the foolish father (Agnidatta) of the story (J.ii.167; DhA.iii.125). We also 
read of his jealousy of the praises bestowed on <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> for 
their knowledge and exposition of the Law, and he claimed that he possessed 
knowledge equal to theirs. But one day when asked to preach, he sat on a seat 
holding a painted fan, but found nothing to say. He thereupon agreed to preach 
in the evening; but the same thing happened, and he barely escaped with his 
life, so furious was his audience. The Buddha, on hearing of this, related the 
<a href="suukara_jat_153.htm" title="s/suukara_jat_153.htm">Sūkara Jātaka</a> (in which Lāludāyī was the pig), showing that in the past, 
too, he had covered himself with disgrace because of his boastfulness. 
J.ii.344ff.; but according to the introductory story of the Jātaka itself (in 
J.ii.9ff.), Lāludāyī’s name is not mentioned, and the incident described differs 
somewhat.</p>
<p>On another occasion, he had a dispute with 
<a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabba 
Mallaputta</a> regarding the allotment of the rice tickets, and the monks, in order 
to teach him a lesson, handed him the tickets to distribute. But he created such 
confusion that there was a great uproar, and <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> was sent by the Buddha to 
find out what was happening. When Ānanda  returned with this story, the Buddha 
related the <a href="tandulanaali_jat_5.htm" title="t/tandulanaali_jat_5.htm">Tandulanāli Jātaka</a> to show that in the past Lāludāyī had been 
a foolish appraiser (J.i.123ff). The <a href="nangalisa_jat_123.htm" title="n/nangalisa_jat_123.htm">Nangalīsa Jātaka</a> gives another example of 
his folly and ineptitude (J.i.446ff); so does also the
<a href="padanjali_jat_247.htm" title="pa/padanjali_jat_247.htm">Padañjali Jātaka</a> 
(J.ii.263f), where he is identified with Padañjali, an idle, lazy loafer. In the 
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahāummagga Jātaka</a> (J.vi.478) he is identified with the somewhat foolish king, Vedeha.</p>
<p>Lāludāyī once had a discussion with 
<a href="pasura.htm" title="pa/pasura.htm">Pasūra</a>, who, at first, 
thought him to be clever and wise, and accepted him as teacher, being ordained 
by him. But, later, Pāsura easily defeated him in discussion (SNA.ii.540). 
Others, too, visiting <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, and seeing him in the Preacher’s seat, mistook 
him for an eminent Elder, but soon discovered their mistake (E.g., DhA.ii.31).</p>
<p>On one occasion (A.iii.192f.; AA.ii.628) Lāludāyī even 
dared to contradict <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> regarding birth among the manomayadevā 
??. Three 
times Sāriputta repeated his statement and three times Lāludāyī contradicted 
him, and, there being no monk in the assembly who supported Sāriputta, he took 
Lāludāyī to the Buddha, where he three times repeated the same statement, being 
three times contradicted. Then the Buddha called Lāludāyī “a witless fool” and 
silenced him. <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> was witness to the dispute, but took no part in it, thereby 
winning the Buddha’s censure.</p>
<p>Elsewhere (A.iv.414f.; AA.ii.810), however, we find 
Lāludāyī listening in all humility to a discourse by Sāriputta on Nibbāna, as the happiness which is not sensed (avedayitasukha). Though Udāyī’s knowledge of 
the Dhamma was not profound, he did not hesitate to take part in a discussion, 
even with the Buddha himself, when occasion arose. We find him twice censured by 
the Buddha for this exhibition of his ignorance, once in the 
<a href="maha_kammavibhanga_s.htm" title="maha/maha_kammavibhanga_s.htm">Mahākamma vibhanga 
Sutta</a> (M.iii.208) and once again in a discussion on anussati (A.iii.322f). In both instances Ānanda is present, and, in the discussion on anussati, he earns the Buddha’s praise for his knowledge compared with Udāyī’s ignorance. This 
annoyed Udāyī, for we find him confronting Ānanda with the fact that though he 
had been in the constant society of the Buddha he had not profited by it, a 
remark which earned the censure of the Buddha and his assurance that Ānanda 
would certainly reach perfection in that very life (A.i.228; AA.i.441).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (ThagA.ii.7; some of the MSS. read nātakācariyaputta ) calls Lāludāyī Kovariyaputta. It is not clear whether this 
means that his father was called Kovariya.</p>
<p>The Vinaya (Vin.iii.110) mentions a 
monk called Udāyī who was a colleague of Seyyasaka. He persuaded Seyyasaka to 
commit the first Sanghādisesa offence, saying that he himself acted likewise. 
For this the Mānatta penalty was imposed on him.  </p>
<p>According to the Commentaries, 
(Sp.iii.517; DhA.iii.5) this Udāyī is to be identified with Lāludāyī, and if 
this be correct, it was perhaps the same monk who was guilty of several Vinaya 
offences attributed to Udāyi&nbsp;- see <a href="udaayii.htm" title="u/udaayii.htm">Udāyi (2)</a> — though the Vinaya 
Commentary does not elsewhere (E.g., Sp.iii.541, 549, 552, where he is simply 
called Udāyi) definitely so identify him, except once (Sp.iv.804), where he is 
mentioned as having made an embroidered robe for a nun, which he persuaded her 
to wear in the assembly of the nuns! Was this because the Commentator regarded 
the two Udāyis as distinct persons? (E.g., MA.i.348).  </p>
<p>Lāludāyī is given as an 
example of a person who did no good either to himself or to others (neva 
attahitāya patipanno no parahitāya). Buddhaghosa elsewhere (Sp.iii.517) 
describes him as “bhantamigasappatibhāgo niddārāmatādim anuyuttānam aññataro 
lolabhikkhu.”</p>
