<hr>
<p>1. Godha Jātaka (No.138).-The Bodhisatta 
was once born as a lizard and paid homage to a good ascetic living near the 
ant-hill where he dwelt. The good ascetic left and was replaced by a wicked one, 
to whom the Bodhisatta paid like homage. One day, the villagers brought a dish 
of lizard’s flesh to the ascetic. Being attracted by its flavour, he planned to 
kill the Bodhisatta, that he might have more of the flesh. But the Bodhisatta 
discovered his intention just in time, and, making good his escape, denounced 
the hypocrite.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
wicked monk. J.i.480f.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Godha Jātaka (No.141).-The Bodhisatta 
was born once as an iguana, leader of many others. His son became intimate with 
a young chameleon, whom he used to clip and embrace. The Bodhisatta warned his 
son against this unnatural intimacy, but, finding his advice of no avail, and 
knowing that danger would come to them through the chameleon, he prepared a way 
of escape, should the need arise. The chameleon, growing tired of the friendship 
with the iguana, showed a trapper the home of the iguanas. The trapper made a 
fire round the hole and killed many of the iguanas as they tried to escape, but 
the Bodhisatta reached safety through the hole he had provided.</p>
<p>The story was told about a treacherous 
monk, identified with the young iguana (J.i.487f). For details see the 
Mahilāmukha Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Godha Jātaka (No.325).-The story of 
the past is very similar to No.1 above, except that there is only mention of one 
ascetic and he is a hypocrite. The young lizard threatened to expose the 
ascetic’s hypocrisy and compelled him to leave the hermitage. The story was 
related in reference to a monk who was a cheat and a rogue (J.iii.84f).</p>
<p>Cf. the Kuhakabrāhmana Vatthu 
(DhA.iv.154f.).</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Godha Jātaka (No.333).-A prince and 
his wife, returning after a long journey, were greatly distressed by hunger, and 
some hunters, seeing them, gave them a roasted lizard. The wife carried it in 
her hand, hanging it from a creeper. Arriving at a lake, they sat down at the 
foot of a tree, and while his wife was away fetching water the prince ate the 
whole lizard. When his wife came back, he told her that the lizard had run away, 
leaving only the tail in his hand. Later, the prince became king, but his wife, 
though appointed queen consort, received no real honour. The Bodhisatta, who was 
the king’s minister, wishing to see justice done to the queen, contrived that 
the king should be reminded of his ingratitude by allusion being made to the 
incident of the roast lizard. The king thereupon realised his neglect of his 
dutiful wife, and conferred on her supreme power.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
couple who had been given a roast lizard, when returning from a journey 
undertaken to collect debts. The husband ate the whole lizard when his wife was 
away. She said nothing and drank some water to appease her hunger, but when they 
visited the Buddha, and be asked her if her husband were good and affectionate, 
she replied in the negative. The Buddha then told her the story of the past. 
J.iii.106f.; cf. Succaja Jātaka.</p>
