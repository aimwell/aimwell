  <h2>Guttila Jātaka (No.243)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of Guttila (q.v.) and his 
contest with Mūsila. Mūsila is identified with Devadatta, Sakka with Anuruddha, 
and the king with Ānanda.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta. The monks had tried to persuade him to acknowledge the Buddha as his 
teacher, because it was from him that he had learned the three Pitakas and the 
four Jhānas. But Devadatta would not consent. J.ii.248ff</p>
