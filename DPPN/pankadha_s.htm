  <h2>Pankadhā Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>When the Buddha stayed at Pañkadhā during one of his tours 
and instructed the monks there, Kassapa of the Hampagotta disapproved of his 
teaching, thinking that he was too scrupulous. But later, when the Buddha 
returned to Rājagaha, Kassapa, filled with remorse, followed him thither, and 
confessing his transgression, begged for forgiveness. The Buddha praised him for 
having made confession, and said that only those monks who were zealous in the 
practice of religion deserved praise, but others did not. A.i.236f.</p>
