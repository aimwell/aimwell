<p>The name given to the monastery erected by 
<a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a> Migāramātā in the 
<a href="pubbarama.htm" title="pu/pubbarama.htm">Pubbārāma</a>, to the east of 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. It is said (DhA.i.410ff.; 
SNA.ii.502; UdA.158; DA.iii.860; SA.i.116, etc.) that, one day, when Visākhā had 
gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks 
and novices, she left in the preaching hall her <a href="mahalata_pasadhana.htm" title="maha/mahalata_pasadhana.htm">
Mahālatāpasādhana</a> and her servant girl forgot to remove it (this incident is 
referred to at Vin.iv.161f., as the cause of the institution of a Vinaya rule).
</p>
<p>Later, on going to fetch it, she found that 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> had put 
it away, and Visākhā, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had 
it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one 
hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sale. 
But there was none in Sāvatthi rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought 
it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the 
Buddha’s suggestion. The site for the pāsāda on the Pubbārāma cost nine crores, 
the buildings costing another nine. While the building was being erected, the 
Buddha went on one of his journeys and, at Visākhā’s request; 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> was 
left to supervise the work with five hundred other monks. Moggallāna made use of 
his iddhi powers in order to expedite and facilitate the work. The building had 
two floors with five hundred rooms in each, the whole structure being surmounted 
by a pinnacle of solid gold, capable of holding sixty water pots. The work was 
completed in nine months, and the celebration of its dedication was held on the 
Buddha’s return. These celebrations lasted for four months and cost a further 
nine crores. On the last day, Visākhā gave gifts of cloth to the monks, each 
novice receiving robes worth one thousand. The building was so richly equipped 
that one of Visākhā’s friends, wishing to spread a small carpet, worth one 
hundred thousand, wandered all over the building, but could find no place of 
which it was worthy. Ānanda found her weeping in disappointment, and suggested 
that it should be spread between the foot of the stairs and the spot where the 
monks washed their feet.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years of his life, when the Buddha 
was living at Sāvatthi, he divided his time between the Anāthapīndikārāma at 
<a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> and the Migāramātupāsāda, spending the day in one place and the night 
in the other and vice versa (SNA.i.336).</p>
<p>It is, therefore, to be expected that numerous suttas were 
preached there; chief among these were the <a href="agganna_sutta.htm" title="am/agganna_sutta.htm">Aggañña</a>, the 
<a href="utthaana_s.htm" title="u/utthaana_s.htm">Utthāna</a>, the 
<a href="ariyapariyesanaa_sutta.htm" title="ay/ariyapariyesanaa_sutta.htm">Ariyapariyesana</a>, and the 
<a href="pasadakampana.htm" title="pa/pasadakampana.htm">Pāsādakampana</a>. See also S.i.77, 190 (= Ud.vi.2); 
iii.100; v. 216, 222f.; A.i.193f.; ii.183f.; iii.344f.; (cp Thag.vss.689 704); 
iv. 204f., 255, 265, 269; Ud.ii.9; DhA.iv.142f.; iv.176.</p>
<p>It was at Migāramātupāsāda that the 
<a href="vighaasa_jat_393.htm" title="vy/vighaasa_jat_393.htm">Vighāsa Jātaka</a> 
was preached, and the Buddha gave permission for the
<a href="patimokkha.htm" title="pa/patimokkha.htm">Pātimokkha</a> to be recited in 
his absence. Sp.i.187.</p>
