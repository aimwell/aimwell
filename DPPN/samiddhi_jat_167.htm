  <h2>Samiddhi J훮taka (No.167)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a young ascetic in the Him훮laya, 
and on one occasion, after wrestling all night with his spirit he bathed at 
sunrise and stood in one garment to dry his body in the sun. A nymph, seeing 
him, tried in vain to tempt him.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Samiddhi Thera, who had 
a similar experience on the banks of the Tapod훮. Seeing his youth and beauty, a 
nymph reminded him that he was yet young, asceticism could be practised in old 
age. Samiddhi replied that no one knew if he would live to see old age. The 
nymph vanished. J.ii.56 8.</p>
