  <h2>Padhānakammika Tissa Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Five hundred monks of Sāvatthi retire into the forest to 
meditate; one (Tissa) falls away, the rest attain arahantship. They return to 
the Buddha, who has a word of praise for all but Tissa. The latter renews his 
determination to become an arahant and walks up and down the cloister all night 
long, thereby earning his nickname. Becoming drowsy, he stumbles over a stone 
and breaks his thigh. As his colleagues are on the way to receive their alms at 
the house of a certain layman they hear his groans, and stopping to minister to 
him, are prevented from receiving their gifts. The Buddha tells them that this 
is not the first time that Tissa has so stood in their way and relates the 
Varana Jātaka (q.v.), a discourse on the evils of procrastination.</p>
<p>DhA.iii.407ff.; in the Varana Jātaka, however, the name of 
the monk is given as Kutumblya Tissa (q.v.); perhaps the two are identical.</p>
