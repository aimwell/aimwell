<p>A vihāra in Rohana, built by Mahādāthika Mahānāga, who 
gave to it a tract of land spreading for half a league round in honour of a 
sāmanera who lived there and had given the king a draught of water 
(Mhv.xxxiv.91). Silādātha heard the Elder of this vihāra preach the sacred 
texts, and, very pleased with him, built for him the Rohana-vihāra. Cv.xlv.53.</p>
