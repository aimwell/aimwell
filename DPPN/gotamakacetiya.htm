<p>A shrine near and to the south of Vesāli 
(D.iii.9). It was considered one of the beautiful spots of that town (E.g., 
D.ii.102, 118) and the Buddha stayed there several times, particularly during 
the first years of his ministry (Thus AA.i.457). During one such stay, he laid 
down the rule which allowed monks the use of three robes; he himself felt cold 
during the night and had to wear extra clothing (Vin.i.288; iii.195).</p>
<p>The shrine was pre-Buddhistic and 
dedicated to a Yakkha named Gotamaka. A vihāra was later built on the spot for 
the Buddha and his monks (UdA.322; DhA.iii.246; AA.i.457; SNA.i.344). 
</p>
<p>There the Gotamaka Sutta was preached. 
(And, according to some, also the Hemavata Sutta [SNA.i.199]). </p>
<p>The Divyāvadāna (p.201), in a list of 
noted places of Vesāli, speaks of a Gautama-nyagrodha. The reference is 
evidently to this cetiya. It has been suggested that the cetiya may have been 
called after the Kāla (Kanha) Gotama Nāgas, but the suggestion appears 
far-fetched. See J. P.T.S.1891, p.67; Windisch: Mara and Buddha, p.68; cp. 
J.ii.145.</p>
