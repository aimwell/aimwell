<p>When Citta-gahapati lies ill various 
devas approach him and urge him to aspire to be a world-ruler. He scorns the 
suggestion and, on being asked by his relations why he is talking to himself, he 
tells them and exhorts them to have faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the 
Sangha. Soon afterwards he dies. S.iv.302f.</p>
