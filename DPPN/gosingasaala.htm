<p><b>1. Gosingasālavanadāya.</b>-A forest tract 
near Nādikā. Once, when Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila were living there, they 
were visited by the Buddha, who came from Giñjakāvasatha. The result of the 
visit was the preaching of the Cūlagosinga Sutta (q.v.) (M.i.205f). On another 
occasion, when the Buddha was staying there with many eminent monks, among whom 
were Sāriputta, Moggallāna and others, their conversation led to the preaching 
of the Mahāgosinga Sutta (q.v.) (M.i.212f).</p>

<p><b>2. Gosingasālavanadāya.</b>-A forest tract 
near <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. When the Buddha was living in the Kūtāgārasāla, in the Mahavana, he 
was visited by many people and there was great disturbance. In order to find 
quiet and solitude, certain monks, among whom were Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkata, 
Kalimbha, Nikata and Katissaha, retired into this forest (A.v.133).</p>
