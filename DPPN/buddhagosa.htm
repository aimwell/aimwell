<h4>1. Buddhaghosa Thera</h4>
<p>The greatest of Commentators on the Tipitaka. He was a 
Brahmin. The Sās. (p. 29) says his father was a purohita, named Kesa, his mother 
being Kesī. Gv.66 says his father was the purohita of King Sangāma. He was born 
in a village near Buddhagayā and became proficient in the Vedas and allied 
branches of knowledge. One day he met a monk, named Revata, and on being 
defeated by him in controversy, entered the Order to learn the Buddha’s 
teachings. Because his speech was profound, like that of the Buddha, and because 
his words spread throughout the world (like those of the Buddha), he came to be 
called Buddhaghosa. While dwelling with Revata, he wrote the Ñānodaya and the 
Atthasālinī, and also began to write a Parittatthakathā (a concise commentary) 
on the Tipitakas. In order to complete his task, he came over to Ceylon at the 
suggestion of Revata (Sās.p.29, says he was sent to Ceylon as punishment for 
thinking himself wiser than his teachers) and studied the Singhalese 
Commentaries at the Mahāvihāra, under Sanghapāla. When his studies were ended he 
wrote the Visuddhimagga, and having thereby won the approval of the Elders of 
the Mahāvihāra, he rendered the Singhalese Commentaries into Pāli. During this 
period he lived in the Ganthākaravihāra, and on the accomplishment of his task 
he returned to Jambudīpa. (Burmese tradition says he obtained his copy of the 
Tipitaka and the Commentaries from the Āloka vihāra. But see P.L.C.83, n.1.4).</p>
<p>Besides the above mentioned works of Buddhaghosa, we have 
also the Samantapāsādikā and the Kankhāvitaranī on the Vinaya Pitaka; the 
Sumangalavilāsinī, the Papañcasūdanī, the Sāratthappakāsinī and the 
Manorathapūranī on the Sutta Pitaka. He is also said to have compiled 
Commentaries on the Khuddakapātha and the Sutta Nipāta (called the 
Paramatthajotikā) and on the Dhammapada. He also wrote a series of Commentaries 
on the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the Atthasālinī, the Sammohavinodanī and the 
Pañcappakaranatthakathā). Some ascribe to him the Jātakatthakathā. For further 
particulars relating to Buddhaghosa, see Law’s “Life and work of Buddhaghosa” 
and P.L.C.79 ff. The account of his life given here is taken from 
Cv.xxxvii.215ff . For a list of works ascribed to Buddhaghosa see Gv., pp.59 and 
68.</p>

<p><b>2. Buddhaghosa. </b>Called Culla Buddhaghosa to 
distinguish him from the greater. He was a native of Ceylon (Gv.67), and two 
works are ascribed to him (Gv.63) — the 
Jātattagīnidāna and the Sotattagīnidāna. The former probably refers to the 
Jātakatthakathā (P.L.C.126). It was at his request that Buddhaghosa (1) wrote 
his Commentaries to the Abhidhamma. Gv.68. </p>
