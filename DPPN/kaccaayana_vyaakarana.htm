<p>A treatise on Pāli grammar by Kaccāyana. 
The treatise is in eight divisions, each division comprising suttas or rules, 
expressed with great brevity; vutti or supplements, to render the suttas 
intelligible; payoga or grammatical analyses, with examples, and nyāsa or 
scholia, explanatory notes of the principal grammatical forms in the shape of 
questions and answers. The nyāsa often exists as a separate book, called the 
Mukhamattadīpanī. Orthodox tradition ascribes the whole work to Mahā Kaccāna, 
but another tradition, recorded in the Kaccāyanabheda, states that the aphorisms 
are by Kaccāyana, the vutti by Sanghānandī, the illustrations by Brahmadatta and 
the nyāsa by Vimalabuddhi — all perhaps belonging to the same school of Avanti 
(see above, Kaccāna).</p>
<p>Kaccāyana’s work shows clearly the 
influence of Sanskrit grammar, chiefly the Kātantra. Many later works were 
written about the Kaccāyana (as it is called) or were based on it, the chief 
among them being the Rūpasiddhi, the Kaccāyanabheda, the Kaccāyanasāra and the 
Kaccāyanavannanā (q.v.). For details see P.L.C.179ff; Bode, 21.</p>
