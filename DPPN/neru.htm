<h4>1. Neru</h4>
<p>The name of a king of India, descendant of Mahāsammata. He 
was the son of Mahāsudassana and father of Mahā Neru. Mhv.ii.5; Dpv.iii.8.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Neru</h4>
<p>A mountain in Himavā. All birds settling there become 
golden. J.iii.247; c.p. Kākaneru, Mahāneru, Sineru, Meru.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Neru Jātaka (No. 379)</h4>
<p>Once, the Bodhisatta was a golden swan living on Cittakūta 
with his brother. One day, while flying homewards, they saw Mount Neru and 
settled down there. All the birds there looked golden by virtue of the lustre of 
the mountain, and no one paid honour to the Bodhisatta and big brother; so they 
flew away.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk of a frontier 
village. At first he was honoured by the people who, however, later, transferred 
their favours elsewhere. But the monk, though very unhappy, contrived to stay 
on. When the Buddha heard of this, he rebuked the monk for remaining where he 
was not appreciated. J.iii.246ff.</p>
