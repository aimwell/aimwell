<p>A city, thirty leagues from Sāvatthi. (DhA.iii.224). It 
was there that the Buddha returned to earth, after preaching the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka in Tāvatimsa, following the performance of the Twin Miracle under the 
Gandamba tree. As the time approached for the Buddha to leave Tāvatimsa , 
Moggallāna (Anuruddha, according to SNA.ii.570; cf. Vsm., p.391) announced his 
coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Sāvatthi, fed by Culla 
Anāthapindika, while Moggallāna expounded the Dhamma. They then made their way 
to Sankassa. The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahāpavārana 
festival. Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha’s descent from Sineru. to 
the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver 
ladder for Mahā Brahmā and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for 
the Buddha. The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round. 
There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avīci below. The 
Buddha was accompanied by Pañcasikha, Mātali, Mahā Brahmā and Suyāma. Sāriputta 
was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavannā, SNA.ii.570), and the 
Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of 
a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand. On this 
occasion was preached the Parosahassa Jātaka (q.v.) to proclaim to the multitude 
the unparalleled wisdom of Sāriputta (DhA.iii.224ff.; see also SNA.ii.570). It 
is said' that the Buddha’s descent to Sankassa had provided opportunity for 
Moggallāna to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in 
skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sāriputta a chance of shining 
in his wisdom. (Ibid., loc. cit.; J.iv.266; see also Jhānasodhana, Sarabhamiga, 
and Candābha Jātakas). He therefore asked of Sāriputta questions which no one 
else could answer. The opening words of the Sāriputta Sutta (q.v.) are supposed 
to refer to this descent from Tusita (sic). The site of the city gate of 
Sankassa is one of the “unchangeable” spots of the world (avijahitatthānam). All 
Buddhas descend at that spot to the world of men after preaching the Abhidhamma 
(BuA.106, 247; MA.i.371, etc.). From Sankassa the Buddha went to Jetavana 
(J.i.193). A shrine was erected on the spot where the Buddha’s right foot first 
touched the ground at Sankassa (DhA.iii.227). When the Chinese pilgrims, Hiouen 
Thsang and Fa Hien, visited the place, they found three ladders, which had been 
built of brick and stone by the ancients, to commemorate the Buddha’s descent, 
but the ladders were nearly sunk in the earth. (Beal, op. cit., i.203; Fa Hien, 
p.24).</p>
<p>There was, in the Buddha’s time, a deer park at Sankassa 
where Suhemanta Thera heard the Buddha preach (ThagA.i.212). During the 
Vajjiputta controversy, Revata Thera, on his way from Soreyya to Sahājāti, went 
through Sankassa. The road he took passed through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbarā 
and Aggālapura (Vin.ii.299f).</p>
<p>Sankassa is now identified with Sankissa Basantapura on 
the north bank of the Ikkhumatī (Kālīnadī), between Atranji and Kanoj, 
twenty-three miles west of Fatehgarh and forty five north of Kanoj.</p>
