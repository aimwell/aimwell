<p>The fifth sutta of the Atthaka Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta. 
It was preached in reference to the divergence of views held by various teachers 
in Sāvatthi.The king, on hearing of their constant disputes, gave orders that a 
company of blind men be collected and an elephant placed before them. They were 
then asked to touch the elephant, and each one described what it appeared like 
to him. Each described that part which he had touched. The king told the 
heretics that their divergent views were as unreliable as the blind men’s 
descriptions of the elephant. The Buddha, hearing of this, preached the sutta in 
order to confirm the king’s judgment.</p>
<p>One should not give oneself up to philosophical 
speculations which lead nowhere and promote wrangles (SN.vs.796 803; 
SNA.ii.1529ff). The sutta is commented upon in the Mahā Niddesa (MNid.102ff).</p>
