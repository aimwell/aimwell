  <h2>Aranavibhanga Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The 139th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya. 
It was preached at Jetavana and contains a statement and an exposition of the 
middle path of peace between the two extremes of pleasures of sense — low, 
ignoble and unprofitable — and self-mortification, also painful and 
unprofitable. The path is the Noble Eightfold Path: in preaching the doctrine 
the preacher should neither appreciate nor depreciate it, he should teach the 
truth in abstract terms of general principle. He should not be a tale-teller nor 
confront anyone with improper remarks; he should speak slowly and not hurriedly; 
he should neither affect provincialisms in speech nor depart from recognised 
parlance.</p>
<p>At the end of the discourse a young man, 
Subhūti, is praised because he walked where calm dwelt (M.iii.230-7; 
MA.ii.977-8).</p>
