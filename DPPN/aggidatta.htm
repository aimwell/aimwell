<p>1. Aggidatta.-Chaplain to the King of 
Kosala, first to Mahākosala, and then to his son Pasenadi. Later he renounced 
the world and, with a large band of followers, wandered about Anga, Magadha and 
Kururattha,, teaching a cult of nature-worship. The Buddha, seeing his 
upanissaya, sent Moggallāna to convert him. Moggallāna went to Aggidatta’s 
hermitage, but being refused shelter there, vanquished, by a display of 
iddhi-power, a nāgarāja, Ahicchatta, who lived in the neighbourhood, and 
occupied the nāga’s abode. While Aggidatta and his followers stand awestruck at 
this event, the Buddha appears, and realising that the Buddha is even greater 
than Moggallāna, they pay homage to him. The Buddha preaches to them on the 
error of their ways. At the end of the discourse they become arahants 
(DhA.iii.241-7).</p>

<p>2. Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Benares and 
father of the Bodhisatta, when the latter was born as Somadatta. The old man 
lived by ploughing, and one of his oxen having died, he decided, on the advice 
of his son, to ask the king for an ox. Somadatta, with great patience, trained 
him in all the formalities to be gone through in an appearance at court, but at 
the crucial moment when Aggidatta was making his petition to the king, he used 
the word “take” where he meant to use “give.” Somadatta’s presence of mind saved 
the situation (DhA.iii.124-5). In the Somadatta Jātaka the name Aggidatta does 
not appear. In the present age he was the Thera Lāludāyī. J.ii.164f.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Khemavatī, 
father of the Buddha Kakusandha. His wife was named Visākhā. D.ii.7; 
Bv.xxiii.14; J.i.42.</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Aggidatta.-See Gahvaratīriya.</p>
