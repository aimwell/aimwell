<p><b>1. Parakkama </b>(Parakkanta). A Pandyan king, probably 
the son of Vikkamapandu, who ruled over Ceylon for two years (1051 52). He was 
slain by the Colas. Cv.lvi.16.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Parakkama. </b>A Pandu king of Madhurā. When 
attacked by Kulasekhara, he appealed for assistance to Parakkamabāhu 1. of 
Ceylon. Parakkamabāhu sent an army under Lankāpura to help him, but by the time 
the Sinhalese forces arrived, Kulasekhara had slain the king and his family and 
seized Madhurā. Parakkama’s youngest son, who escaped death, was Vīrapandu 
(Cv.lxxvi.76ff., 142, 193, 200). Parakkama was killed in the village of 
Tirimalakka. Ibid., lxxvii.52.</p>

<p><b>3. Parakkama. </b>The general and minister of Queen 
Līlāvatī. He belonged to the family of the Kālanāgaras and was responsible for 
the queen’s accession. He seems to have been slain by the Pandu king Parakkama 
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; see below (Cv.lxxx.49, 52). This Parakkama, was a patron of 
learning, and the Dāthāvamsa (q.v.) was written at his request.</p>

Līlāvatī and captured the throne of Ceylon. He ruled in Pulatthinagara, but was
