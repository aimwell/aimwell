<p>Once when the Buddha was going about for 
alms near the fig-tree at the cattle tethering in the neighbourhood of Isipatana, 
he saw a monk, whose delight was in the empty outer joys of sense, and 
admonished him, saying that flies will settle on and attack him who is corrupt 
and reeks with the stench of carrion. Hearing this, the monk was greatly 
stirred. Later the Buddha repeated the admonition to the assembled monks and 
explained that greed was corruption, malice the stench of carrion and evil ways 
of thought the flies. A.i.280f.</p>
