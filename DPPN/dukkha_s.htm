<hr>
<p>1. Dukkha Sutta.-Dukkha arises from the 
contact of the senses and the objects proper to the senses, resulting in 
feeling, which, in turn, produces craving. By destroying this process dukkha is 
destroyed. S.ii.71; cf. S.iv.86.</p>
<p>2. Dukkha Sutta.-All the khandhas are 
ill; he who realizes this destroys rebirth. S.iii.21; 196.</p>
<p>3. Dukkha Sutta.-All the khandhas lead 
to suffering. S.iii.77.</p>
<p>4. Dukkha Sutta.-The Buddha teaches 
suffering, the arising thereof, the cessation, and the way to such cessation. 
S.iii.158.</p>
<p>5. Dukkha Sutta.-That which is suffering 
and of the nature of suffering must be put away. S.iv.199.</p>
<p>6. Dukkha Sutta.-Sāriputta tells 
Jambukhādaka of the three kinds of suffering, caused by pain, by the activities 
and by the changeable nature of things. S.iv.259.</p>
<p>7. Dukkha Sutta.-A monk without faith is 
unconscientious, has no fear of blame, is indolent and lacking in insight, lives 
ill at ease in this world and will suffer in the next. A.iii.3.</p>
<p>8. Dukkha Sutta.-If a monk has brooding 
on sense-desires, ill-will, cruelty and conjures up thoughts of these things, he 
will live ill at ease now and also after death. A.iii.429.</p>
