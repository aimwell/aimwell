  <h2>Aparāditthi Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A certain Brahmā thought that no recluse 
or brahmin could come to his world. To refute his views, the Buddha went there 
and sat in the air above the Brahmā, flames radiating from his body. The Buddha 
was followed by Moggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākappina and Anuruddha. </p>
<p>The Brahmā was at first agitated by 
their presence, but later he was delighted on learning from Moggallāna, who was 
questioned by an attendant Brahmā, that there were many more disciples of the 
Buddha who could do as he and the others had done, and that they were holy men. 
S.i.144-6. See also Bakabrahma Sutta.</p>
