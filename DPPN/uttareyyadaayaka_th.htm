<p>An arahant. In Padumuttara’s time he was 
a learned brahmin of Hamsavatī. One day, when going to bathe with his pupils, he 
saw the Buddha and gave him his upper garment (uttarīya). The garment remained 
in the sky, forming a canopy over the Buddha and his monks. As a result, for 
thirty thousand kappas, Uttareyyadāyaka was born in the deva-worlds, and fifty 
times he became king of the gods. On thirty-six occasions he was king of men. 
Everywhere he went a canopy of fine material appeared over him and he obtained 
all he wished for. Ap.i.272-3.</p>
