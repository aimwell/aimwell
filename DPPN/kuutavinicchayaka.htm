<p>One of Bimbisāra’s judges, who was a 
cheat, a slanderer, and a taker of bribes, once observed the fast for half a day 
through a friend’s persuasion. He died that night and was born as a 
Vemānika-peta. He enjoyed divine pleasures, but was condemned to eat the flesh 
off his own back in expiation of his evil deeds.</p>
<p>Nārada saw this peta and reported his 
story to the Buddha. Pv.iii.9; PvA.209f.</p>
