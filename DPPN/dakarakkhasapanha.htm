</ul>
<p>At the suggestion of Mahosadha the 
ascetic Bherī asks King Cūlanī what he would do if he were voyaging on the ocean 
with his mother, wife, brother, friend, chaplain, and Mahosadha, and a 
water-demon, seeking human sacrifice, were to seize the ship.  </p>
<p>The king answered 
that he would sacrifice all but the last, in the order given, and then himself, 
but that Mahosadha should not be sacrificed. Bherī persuaded the king to make 
this declaration in public, so that Mahosadha’s glory might be spread far and 
wide. J.vi.469ff., 477, 478.</p>
