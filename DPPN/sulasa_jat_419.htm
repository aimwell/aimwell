<h2>Sulasā Jātaka (No. 419)</h2>

<p>Once in Benares there lived a courtezan, Sulasā, whose price was one thousand a night. In Benares also lived a 
robber, Sattaka. One day he was taken by the king's men, and, as he was being 
led to execution, Sulasā saw him and fell in love with him. She bribed the chief 
guard to free him and lived with him. After a few months Sattaka, tired of her, 
and, wishing to kill her, took her to a lonely mountain top, saying that he had 
made a vow to the deity dwelling there. When Sulasā discovered his real 
intention, she begged leave to be allowed to pay obeisance to him before her 
death, and, as she walked round him, she watched her opportunity and pushed him 
down the precipice, where he was crushed to death.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Puññalakkhanā, a 
slave girl of Anāthapindika's wife. The girl borrowed a costly jewel belonging 
to her mistress and went to the pleasure garden. There a thief became friendly 
with her and planned to kill her. But she, reading his thoughts, asked him to 
draw some water for her from a well near by, and as he did so, she pushed him 
into the well and threw a stone down on to his head. The characters in the two 
stories were identical. J.iii.435-9; cf. the story of <a href="bhadda_kundalakesa.htm">Bhaddā Kundalakesā</a> and also the <a href="kanavera_jat_318.htm">Kanavera Jātaka</a>.</p>
