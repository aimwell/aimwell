<p>A tree in the Asurabhavana (S.v.238) 
which lives for a whole aeon. When the Asuras were pushed out of the deva-world 
into their present abode, it was the presence of this tree which revealed to 
them their where-abouts (J.i.202; SNA.ii.485; MA.i.476; DhA.i.272). It is said 
(DhA.i.280) that whenever the Cittapātali blossomed, the Asuras thought of the 
Pāricchattaka-tree which they had left behind in Tāvatimsa and started making 
preparations for a war against Sakka.</p>
