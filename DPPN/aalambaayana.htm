  <h2>Ālambāyana</h2>

<p>Originally the name of a spell taught to 
an ascetic by a <a href="garudaa.htm" title="g/garudaa.htm">Garuda</a> king who had unwittingly torn up by its roots a banyan 
tree which grew at the end of the ascetic’s walk. The ascetic taught it to a 
poor brahmin of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> who had gone into the forest to escape his creditors and 
who ministered to the ascetic.  </p>
<p>The brahmin became known as Ālambāyana after he 
learnt the spell. Having learnt it he left the forest and was walking along the 
banks of the <a href="yamunaa.htm" title="y/yamunaa.htm">Yamunā</a>, when he came across a host of 
<a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāgas</a>, sitting, after their 
sports, round the Nāga gem which grants all desires. The Nāgas, hearing the man 
repeat the charm, fled in terror, believing him to be the Garuda, and he took 
possession of their jewel. Soon after, Ālambāyana met an outcast brahmin with 
his son, Somadatta, and on their agreeing to show him the Nāga King, Bhūridatta, 
he gave them the jewel.  </p>
<p>With the help of his spell Ālambāyana tamed Bhūridatta 
and went about giving exhibitions of the Nāga’s skill. Bhūridatta was finally 
rescued by his brother Sudassana and his sister Accimukhī. In the contest of 
skill which Ālambāyana had with Sudassana, <a href="accimukhii.htm" title="am/accimukhii.htm">Accimukhī</a> assumed the form of 
a frog and let drip three drops of poison on her brother’s hand, and these were 
allowed to fall into a hole specially prepared and filled with cow-dung. A flame 
burst out and Ālambāyana was smitten with the heat. His skin changed colour and 
he became a white leper.</p>
<p>The story is told in the 
<a href="bhuridatta_jat_543.htm" title="b/bhuridatta_jat_543.htm">Bhūridatta 
Jataka</a> (J.vi.179-97).</p>
<p>The name Ālambāyana appears also as 
Ālambāna and as Ālamba. </p>
