<p>Mogharāja asks the Buddha how he should regard the world 
in order to escape death. The Buddha replies that the world should be regarded 
as empty (suññato) and one must get rid of the thought of self (attānuditthi) 
(SN.vss.1116-19; the Buddha’s answer is quoted at 
Kvu.p.64). </p>
<p>It is said (SN.vs.1116; SNA.ii.601f ) that Mogharāja tried 
twice before to ask the question, once at the conclusion of the preaching of the 
Ajita Sutta and again at the end of the recitation of the Tissa Metteyya Sutta; 
but the Buddha, knowing that he was not yet ready for conversion, did not give 
him an opportunity.</p>
