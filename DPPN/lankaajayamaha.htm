<p>A title conferred by Devānampiyatissa on Bodhigutta, leader of the embassy which brought the Bodhi 
  tree from India to Ceylon. The title was a higher one than that of 
  Jayamahālekhaka, which was conferred on Sumitta. See Mbv., p. 164f., for a 
  description of the ceremony of investiture. It was, evidently, continued in 
  later times, because one of the officers of Parakkamabāhu I. was called 
  Lankāmahālāna (Cv.lxix.12), which appears to be a corruption of “Lankāmahālekhakanāyaka.”</p>
