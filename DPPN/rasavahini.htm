<p>A collection of stories in Pāli, by Vedeha, a monk of the Vanavāsī fraternity 
in Ceylon. The work probably belongs to the early part of the fourteenth 
century, and seems to be a revision of an old Pāli translation made from an 
original Singhalese compilation by Ratthapāla Thera of the Mahāvihāra.  </p>
<p>The 
present text consists of one hundred and three stories, forty relating to 
incidents occurring in Jambudīpa and the rest to Ceylon. There exists a glossary 
on the work called the Rasavāhinīganthi (P.L.C.210; Svd.1264). v.l. 
Madhurarasavāhinī.</p>
