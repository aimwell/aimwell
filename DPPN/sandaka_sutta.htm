<p>Ānanda, staying at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, visits the 
Pilakkhaguhā near Devakata pool, where the Paribbājaka Sandaka is staying with 
some five hundred followers. Ānanda is asked to give a discourse on the Buddha’s 
teachings, and speaks of the four antitheses to the higher life: there is the 
teacher who holds that it does not matter whether actions are good or bad; the 
teacher who holds that no evil is done by him who acts himself or causes others 
to act; the teacher holding that there is no cause for either depravity or 
purity; and, lastly, the teacher who holds, among other things, that men make an 
end of ill only when they have completed their course of transmigrations, like a 
ball of twine which continues rolling as long as there is string to unwind. On 
these heresies cf. Sāleyyaka Sutta. The reference is evidently to the teachings 
of Purāna Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla and others.</p>
<p>Ānanda then proceeds to explain the four comfortless 
vocations: the teacher who claims to be all knowing and all seeing; the teacher 
whose doctrine is traditional and scriptural; the rationalist of pure reason and 
criticism teaching a doctrine of his own reasoning; and, lastly, the teacher who 
is stupid and deficient. Ānanda then describes the Buddha’s own teaching, 
leading up to the four Jhānas. Sandaka and his followers accept the Buddha as 
their teacher. M.i.513-24.</p>
