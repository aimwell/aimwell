<p>1. Kāya Sutta.-Mindfulness relating to 
the body is the path to the Uncompounded (asankhata). This the Buddha has taught 
his disciples. S.iv.359.</p>
<p>2. Kāya Sutta.-Just as the body is 
sustained by material food so are the five hindrances maintained by their own 
foods. The sutta explains what these foods are. S.v.64f</p>
<p>3. Kāya Sutta.-Same as above, but in 
reference to the seven bojjhangas. S.v.65f</p>
<p>4. Kāya Sutta.-There are certain things 
that should be got rid of by action, others by speech, yet others by mind. The 
sutta explains what these things are and how to get rid of them. A.v.39f</p>
