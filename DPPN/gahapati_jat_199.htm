<p>Once, in Kāsi, the Bodhisatta’s wife 
carried on an intrigue with the village headman. The husband, determined to 
catch them, pretended to leave the village, but returned as soon as the headman 
entered the house. The wife, seeing her husband, climbed into the granary, and 
professed that the headman was there to demand the price of meat which he had 
supplied to them during a famine, and that as there was no money he insisted on 
being given the value in grain, which, she said, she was determined to refuse to 
do. But the Bodhisatta saw through the ruse, thrashed the headman and then his 
wife.</p>
<p>The Buddha related the story to a 
backsliding monk to demonstrate to him how women were always sinful (J.ii.134f).</p>
