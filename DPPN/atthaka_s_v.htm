<p><b>Atthaka-Vagga.</b>-The fourth division of 
the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a>. It consists of sixteen suttas, all of which are explained in 
the <a href="niddesa.htm" title="n/niddesa.htm">Mahā Niddesa</a>. It may also have been the name of divisions of other books, 
because we are told that once <a href="sona.htm" title="s/sona.htm">Sona Thera</a> intoned before the Buddha all the 
verses of the Books of the Eights (Atthaka-vaggikāni). Vin.i.196-7. The DhA. 
(iv.101-2) says he recited the 16 portions of the Atthakavagga.</p>
<p>Nandamātā Upāsikā was once reciting the 
Atthakavagga and the <a href="parayana.htm" title="pa/parayana.htm">Parāyanavagga</a> on the roof of her house, and 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a>, 
while on the way with his followers to see the Buddha, listened to her recital 
(SnA.i.370; but see A.iv.63, where only the Parāyana is mentioned). According to 
this tradition, the Atthakavagga was already being recited in the Buddha’s own 
time.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit the title was known as 
Artha-varga and was so understood by the Chinese translators. No one has 
explained what the title means nor has interpreted the second sutta (Guhatthaka) 
except as “The eight Verses on the cave,” and similarly with the three following 
suttas: Dutthatthaka, Suddhattha and Paramatthaka, each of eight verses. The 
fact that it is commented on separately in the Mahā Niddesa and was translated 
into Chinese makes it appear probable that it was once a separate work. See 
Thomas, op. cit., 274.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Atthaka Sutta.</b>-Two of the same name. 
They deal with the methods of mastering the feelings, of bringing about their 
cessation and of the six ways of calming them. S.iv.221f.</p>
