<p>Wife of Vessavana and a devout follower of the Buddha. 
Once, when Sakka went to see the Buddha at the Salalāgāra, he found the Buddha 
engaged in meditation, Bhuñjatī waiting on him and worshipping him with clasped 
hands. Sakka asked her to salute the Buddha in his name when he should awake 
from his meditation (D.ii.270f). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa adds (DA.iii.705) that Bhuñjatī had reached 
the second Fruit of the Path and found no pleasure in the luxuries of heaven.</p>
