  <h2>Pañcaverabhaya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Jetavana to Anāthapindika. The Ariyan disciple 
is free from the fivefold guilty dread: he knows that he is not guilty of taking 
life, of theft, of wrong indulgence of the senses, of falsehood, of the use of 
intoxicants, and he is free from dread of the guilt attaching to these. He is 
also possessed of unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and 
sees the Ariyan truth of the Causal Law. He thus begets confidence regarding his 
ultimate destiny. S.ii.68ff.</p>
