  <h2>Sāmaññaphala Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The second sutta of the <a href="diigha_nikaaya.htm" title="d/diigha_nikaaya.htm">Dīgha Nikāya</a>. 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, 
accompanied by <a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka</a>, visits the Buddha at Jīvaka’s
<a href="ambavana.htm" title="am/ambavana.htm">Ambavana</a> and questions him 
on the fruits of recluse ship, wherefore men join the Buddha’s Order. The Buddha 
answers and includes in his answer his justification for the foundation of the 
Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, and the practical rules by which life 
in the Order is regulated. </p>
<p>The sutta also contains a list of ordinary occupations 
followed by people in the Buddha’s day, which forms interesting reading.</p>
<p>In the introductory story, <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> explains that he has 
already put the question to the founders of six other Orders:  </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Pūrana Kassapa, 
</a></li>
  <li><a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali Gosāla, 
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="ajitakesakambala.htm" title="am/ajitakesakambala.htm">Ajita Kesakambala, 
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="pakudha_kaccayana.htm" title="pa/pakudha_kaccayana.htm">Pakudha Kaccāyana, 
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta 
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="sanjaya_belatthiputta.htm" title="sa/sanjaya_belatthiputta.htm">Sañjaya Belatthiputta.
  </a></li>
</ul>
<p>But these teachers, instead of answering his questions, 
give a general statement of their theories.</p>
<p>The summaries given here of their teachings are of great 
interest, because they form some sort of evidence, at least, as to the 
speculations favoured by them. By means of a counter question, the Buddha finds 
from Ajātasattu that even if a servant of his joined the Order, he would receive 
the king’s honour and respect. Then the Buddha proceeds to show, step by step, 
the fruits higher and nobler, which await the samana, immediate in their effect, 
culminating in the six fold abhiññā of the arahant. The king is greatly 
impressed, takes refuge in the Buddha, and expresses his remorse for having 
killed his father. The Buddha utters no word of blame, but after the departure 
of the king, he informs the monks that if Ajātasattu had not been guilty of 
patricide he would have realized the first fruit of the Path (D.i.47 86).</p>
<p>The Commentary adds (DA.i.238) that as a result of hearing 
this discourse, Ajātasattu would, in the future, become a Pacceka Buddha named 
Viditavisesa. From this moment, Ajātasattu was one of the Buddha’s most devoted 
followers. It is said that, after his father’s death, Ajātasattu could never 
sleep at night until he had heard the Buddha, after which he enjoyed peaceful 
sleep.</p>
