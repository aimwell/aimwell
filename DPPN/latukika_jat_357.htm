  <h2>Latukika Jātaka (No. 357)</h2>

<p>A quail once laid her eggs in the feeding ground of the 
elephants. When the young ones were hatched, the Bodhisatta, the leader of the 
elephants, passed along that way with the herd, and, at the request of the 
mother quail, carefully avoided the young ones. But a rogue elephant, who came 
after, though warned in the same way, trod on the nest and fouled it. The quail 
swore revenge, and got a crow to put out the elephant’s eyes and a fly to put 
maggots in them, and when the elephant, in great pain, looked for water, she 
persuaded a frog to croak on the mountain top and thus to lead the elephant into 
a precipice down which he fell and was killed.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Devadatta who was 
identified with the rogue elephant (J.iii.174 77). In the accounts (see Rohinī ) 
of the quarrel between the Sākyans and the Koliyans, this Jātaka is said to have 
been one of those preached by the Buddha on that occasion, showing that even 
such a weak animal as a quail could sometimes cause the death of an elephant. 
Perhaps the story was related on more than one occasion. See also below, 
Latukikopama sutta.</p>
<p>See DhA.i.46, where it is related to the Kosambī monks to 
show the danger of quarrelling.</p>
