<p>1. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Preached at 
Pācīnavamsadāya to Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. It was at the time of the 
quarrel of the Kosambī monks; the Buddha, in search of quietness, goes to 
Bālakalonaka, preaches there to Bhagu and proceeds to Pācīnavamsadāya, where he 
tells his cousins how they should develop meditation, getting rid of all 
obstacles. M.iii.152ff. The verses of the sutta are also found in the Vinaya 
version (i.349ff). Some of the verses are included in the Dhammapada (vv.328-30) 
and in the Khaggavisāna Butts of the Sutta Nipāta (vv.11, 12).</p>
<p>2. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Gold ore must be 
purified from all its dross before it can be used for making ornaments, etc.; 
similarly, the mind must be freed from its impurities — the five nīvaranas — 
before it can be used for acquiring the higher knowledge (A.iii.16-19).</p>
<p>3. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Four things prevent 
the sun and the moon from shining with their full brilliance — clouds, mist, 
smoke and dust and Rāhu. Similarly four things diminish the holiness of ascetics 
and recluses — intoxicants, sex, money and wrong livelihood (A.ii.53f).</p>
