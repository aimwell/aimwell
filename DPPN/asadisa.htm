<p>1. Asadisa.-The Bodhisatta born as the 
son of Brahmadatta, King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Brahmadatta was also the name of Asadisa’s 
brother. When the father died, the kingdom was offered to Asadisa, but he 
refused it and handed it over to his brother. Finding that his presence in the 
city was causing anxiety to the latter, he left Benares and entered into the 
service of another king, as archer. He attained great fame by his wonderful 
feats of archery. Once he brought down a mango with the downward shot of an 
arrow, which, in its upward flight, reached the realm of the Cātummahārājikā, 
whence it was turned back by another arrow, which, having accomplished its 
purpose, rose to Tavatimsa.</p>
<p>Later, on hearing that seven kings had 
beleaguered his brother’s kingdom, Asadisa shot an arrow, bearing a message, 
into the dish from which the kings were eating, and they all fled.</p>
<p>He soon afterwards became an ascetic and 
at his death was born in the Brahma world. J.ii.86-92.</p>

<p>2. Asadisa.-A brahmin village, the
