  <h2>Pothila, Potthila Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>During the dispensation of seven Buddhas, he was learned 
in the Tipitaka and preached to large numbers of monks, but he failed to win any 
attainment for himself. Wishing to rouse him to exert himself, the Buddha 
constantly referred to him as “Tuccha-Pothila.” Pothila took the hint, and, 
travelling one hundred and twenty leagues, arrived at a forest hermitage where 
lived thirty monks. He asked their leader to help him, but he referred him to a 
junior monk, who, in his turn, referred him on, and so on, until at last he was 
forced to apply to the seven year old novice who sat doing needlework. With his 
pride humbled, Pothila asked him for advice. In order to test him, the novice 
asked him to jump into a pool with his robes on. This Pothila did, and the 
novice, satisfied as to his earnestness taught him how, in the case of an 
anthill with six holes into which a lizard entered, anyone, wishing to capture 
the lizard, would close up five of the holes. So with the six doors of the 
senses; close five doors, and concentrate on the door of the mind. At the end of 
the discourse, the Buddha appeared before Pothila in a ray of light and Pothila 
became an arahant (DhA.iii.417-21). </p>
<p>Two verses, addressed to him by Moggallāna, are given in 
the Theragāthā (Vs. 1174-5).</p>
