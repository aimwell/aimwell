<p>The story of a dog and an elephant who 
grew up to be great friends and became indispensable to each other. The dog used 
to amuse himself by swinging backwards and forwards on the elephant’s trunk. One 
day the merchant sold the dog. The elephant went off his food and would not be 
consoled till the dog was brought back.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to two 
monks of Sāvatthi who were very intimate with one another and spent all their 
time together. J.i.189f.</p>
