<p>Connected with a monk, who, through 
over-exertion, died as he leaned against the terrace-post. His life-work 
unfinished, he is born in Tāvatimsa leaning against a door-post. Accosted by the 
nymphs with song and music, he thinks he is yet a monk till they bring a 
cheval-glass and reveal to him his figure. In disappointment he seeks the 
Master, who preaches to him. S.i.33; SA.i.67f.</p>
