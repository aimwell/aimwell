<p><b>1. Yudhitthila.</b> Son of the Pandu king and one of 
the five husbands of Kanhā. J.v.424, 426.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Yudhitthila.</b> Son of Sabbadatta, king of Ramma, 
and younger brother of the Bodhisatta, born as Yuvañjaya. He is identified with 
Ānanda. See the Yuvañjaya Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Yudhitthila.</b> The name of a gotta to which 
Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurus, belonged (J.iii.400; v. 59, etc.). Mention is 
made also of a Koravyarājā of the Yudhitthilagotta (J.iv.361). Probably the 
kings of the Kurus (q.v.) belonged mostly to a dynasty that claimed its descent 
from Yudhitthila (Yudhisthira?).</p>
