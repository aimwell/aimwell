<p>A district in Jambudīpa; it is mentioned 
in a list of places passed by the Buddha on his way from Verañjā to Bārānasī, 
across the Ganges, the route passing through Verañjā, Soreyya, Sankassa, 
Kannakujja, Payāgatittha, here crossing the river to Benares (Vin.iii.11). It 
may have been the very road followed by Revata when going from Sankassa to 
Sahajāti, this road passing through Kannakujja, Udumbara, and Aggalapura 
(Vin.ii.299).</p>
<p>In the Dīpavamsa (iii.26; MT. (82) calls 
it Kannagotta) the city is called Kannagoccha, and is said to have been the 
capital of nine kings of the Mahāsammata race, the last king being Naradeva.</p>
<p>According to Hiouen Thsang, the distance 
from Sankassa to Kannakujja was two hundred li, or thirty-three miles, in a 
north-west direction. Fa Hsien gives the distance as forty-nine miles. (Buddhist 
Records, p.205; Giles, p.47. For a descriptive account see CAGI.433ff; see also 
Mtu.ii.442f.; 459f.; 485 and iii.16, 34).</p>
<p>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary 
(p.193), it was at Kannakujja that Phussa Buddha first preached to his two chief 
disciples. Again (BuA.210), it was at the gates of Kannakujja that the Buddha 
Kakusandha showed the Twin Miracle.</p>
