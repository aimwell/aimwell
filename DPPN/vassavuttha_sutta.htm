<p>A monk, who had spent the vassa at Sāvatthi with the 
Buddha, goes to Kapilavatthu, where he is visited by the Sākyans who wish to 
learn of the welfare of the Buddha and his disciples and of the teaching of the 
Buddha during the vassa. The monk tells them of a statement made by the Buddha, 
to the effect that only few in the world become arahants, anāgāmīs, sakadāgāmīs 
or even sotāpannas. S.v.405.</p>
