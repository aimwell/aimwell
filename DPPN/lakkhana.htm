<p><b>1. Lakkhana.</b> 
  Son of Dasaratha and brother of Rāma, Sītā and Bharata. He is identified with 
  Sāriputta. J.iv.130; for details see the Dasaratha Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. <a name="2. Lakkhana">Lakkhana</a></b>. One of the eight brahmins who recognized the 
  auspicious signs at the birth of the Buddha (J.i.56). The Milinda (Mil. 236) 
  speaks of him as one of the Buddha’s first teachers.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. <a name="2. Lakkhana">Lakkhana</a><span lang="en-us"> 
Thera</b>. Mentioned as having stayed with Mahā Moggallāna on 
Gijjhakūta. Once, when they were going down to Rājagaha for alms, Lakkhana 
noticed that at a certain spot Moggallāna smiled; on asking him why, he was told 
to wait till they saw the Buddha. When the question was repeated in the Buddha’s 
presence, Moggallāna said that he had smiled on seeing various Petas with 
gruesome forms flying through the air. From the text it would appear that these 
visions were seen again on several occasions. S.ii.254; Vin.iii.104ff.; the 
stories of some of the Petas seen and of their past lives are given in detail in 
DhA.ii.68ff.; iii.60ff.; 410ff., 479.</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.ii.159) explains that Lakkhana was one 
of the thousand Jatilas ordained by the Buddha (when he converted the Tebhātika 
Jatilas). He attained arahantship at the conclusion of the preaching of the 
Ādittapariyāyadesanā. He was called Lakkhana because of his marvellous 
personality, “like unto Brahmā’s” (brahmasamena). It adds further that 
Lakkhana’s failure to see the Petas was not because he lacked the divine eye but 
because he was not giving attention (anāvajjento), as a clairvoyant must. It is 
said (Vin.iii.105) that when Moggallāna related his vision, some of the monks 
blamed him for claiming superhuman powers (uttarimanussadhamma), but the Buddha 
declared him free from blame.</p>

<p><b>4. Lakkhana</b>. 
  A deer, son of the Bodhisatta, identified with Sāriputta. For his story see 
  the Lakkhana Jātaka.</p>
