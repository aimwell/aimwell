<p>A tree in Tāvatimsa, which grew in the Nandanavana as the 
result of the Kovilāra tree planted by Magha outside the Sudhammāsālā. It is one 
hundred leagues in circumference and at its foot is the Pandukambalasilāsana 
(DhA.i.273). The Cittapātali in the Asura world corresponds to the Pāricchattaka 
in Tāvatimsa, but the flowers are different (Ibid., 280; SNA.485). The colour of 
the flowers is visible fifty leagues away, while their perfume travels one 
hundred leagues. The devas eagerly watch each stage of development of leaf and 
flower, and each stage is marked by great rejoicings (A.iv.117f). When the 
flowers are fully open they shine like the morning sun. They are never plucked; 
a wind arises and sweeps away the faded flowers and scatters fresh ones on the 
seats of Sakka and the other gods of Tāvatimsa. The bodies of the devas are 
completely covered with the sweetly scented pollen, making them resemble golden 
caskets. The ceremony of playing with the flowers lasts four months 
(AA.ii.730f). The Pāricchattaka is one of the seven trees which last throughout 
the kappa (AA.i.264).</p>
<p>The Pāricchattaka is generally described as a Kovilāra 
(E.g., VvA. 174). It is also called the Pārijāta, the Sanskrit name being 
Pāriyātra. E.g., Dvy.184, 195, 219.</p>
