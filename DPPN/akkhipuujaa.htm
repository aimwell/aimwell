<p>A festival held by Asoka in honour of 
the Buddha when Māhakāla created for him a figure of the Buddha. The festival 
lasted for seven days (Mhv.v.94). </p>
<p>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā explains it by saying 
that the king fasted for seven days, standing gazing at the figure with 
unwinking eyes. But even at the time of the Tīkā there seems to have been 
uncertainty regarding the meaning of the word. See MT.209f.</p>
