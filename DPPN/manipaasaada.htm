<p>The name given to the Lohapāsāda, 
  after it had been rebuilt in seven storeys by Jetthatissa.  </p>
<p>He offered to the 
  building a jewel worth sixty thousand, hence its name.  </p>
<p>The building was worth 
  one crore (Mhv.xxxvi.125).  </p>
<p>The Colas burnt it down, and Udaya IV. tried to 
  rebuild it, but died before the work was completed (Cv.liii.51). This was done 
  by Mahinda IV. Cv.liv.48.</p>
