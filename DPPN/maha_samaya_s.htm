<h2>Mahāsamaya Sutta</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahāsamaya Sutta.</b> Preached at 
<a href="mahavana.htm" title="maha/mahavana.htm">Mahāvana</a> in 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>, where the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was staying with five hundred arahants. The gods 
of the ten thousand world systems had come to visit the Buddha and the monks, 
and were joined by four gods from the <a href="suddhavaasa.htm" title="s/suddhavaasa.htm">Suddhāvāsā</a>, who saluted the Buddha in 
verse. The Buddha then addressed the monks and recited this sutta (D.ii.253-62). 
It is possible to divide the discourse into three parts. </p>
<p>The first contains a 
list of the devas and other beings present to worship the Buddha. It is a long 
list of strange names given in verses, mostly doggerel. Many of the beings 
mentioned are to us now mere names, with no special information attached. Most 
of them were probably local deities, the personification of natural phenomena, 
guardian spirits, fairies, harpies, naiads, dryads, and many others, who are 
here represented as adherents of the Buddha, come to do him honour. It is 
noteworthy that even the most important gods — 
e.g., <a href="soma.htm" title="s/soma.htm">Soma</a>, <a href="varuna.htm" title="va/varuna.htm">Varuna</a> and 
<a href="brahmaloka.htm" title="b/brahmaloka.htm">Brahmā</a> — are only 
incidentally mentioned, added to the list, as it were, without special 
distinction. A similar list of devas is found in the Mahavastu (i. 245; iii.68, 
77); the addition of Siva to this list is significant. The list of gods given in 
the Mahāsamaya should be compared with that given in the 
<a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Atānātiya Sutta</a>.</p>
<p>The second part of the sutta is the framework of the words 
attributed to the Buddha, introducing the list of devas, giving the Buddha’s 
warning to the monks to beware of <a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> and Māra’s declaration that he had no 
power over them as arahants are free from fear.</p>
<p>The third part of the sutta may be called the prologue, 
the verses of greeting spoken by the devas from <a href="suddhaavaasaa.htm" title="s/suddhaavaasaa.htm">Suddhāvāsā</a> (Rhys Davids, 
Dial.ii.282f).</p>
<p>This prologue is elsewhere preserved as a separate episode 
(S.i.27).</p>
<p>The Commentaries give long accounts of the preaching of 
the Mahāsamya (E.g., SNA. 357ff.; DA.ii.672ff). The arahants mentioned are 
Sākiyan and Koliyan youths, representatives of Sākiyan and Koliyan families, sent 
to join the Order as a sign of gratitude to the Buddha for having averted the 
quarrel between the two families regarding the water of the 
<a href="rohini.htm" title="r/rohini.htm">Rohinī</a>. On that 
occasion the Buddha had preached to the opposing armies the 
<a href="attadanda_s.htm" title="ay/attadanda_s.htm">Attadanda Sutta</a> and 
the <a href="phandana_jat_475.htm" title="pu/phandana_jat_475.htm">Phandana</a>, 
<a href="latukika_jat_357.htm" title="l/latukika_jat_357.htm">Latukika</a> and 
<a href="vattaka_jat_35_118_394.htm" title="va/vattaka_jat_35_118_394.htm">Vattaka Jātakas</a> (DA.ii.674 adds the Pathavuddriyana 
and the <a href="rukkhadhamma_jat_074.htm" title="r/rukkhadhamma_jat_074.htm">Rukkhadhamma Jātakas</a>). He then related the story of their origin, 
showing that both families were descended from a common stock. When the quarrel 
was thus settled, two hundred and fifty young men from each family entered the 
Order and the Buddha dwelt with them in Mahāvana. But the wives of the men tried 
to entice them back; the Buddha, therefore, took them to Himavā, where he 
preached to them the <a href="kunaala_jat_536.htm" title="ku/kunaala_jat_536.htm">Kunāla Jātaka</a> on the banks of the Kunāla Lake. At the 
conclusion of the sermon they attained to various fruits of the Path, from 
anāgāmī-phala to sotāpatti. He then returned with them to Mahāvana, where they 
developed insight and became arahants. They assembled to pay homage to their 
teacher on the evening of the full moon day of Jetthamāsa, and to the assembly 
came the devas of the ten thousand world systems. The Buddha told the monks the 
names of the devas present (as given in the Mahāsamaya), and, surveying the 
assembly, saw that it consisted of two kinds of beings, one capable of 
benefiting by his teaching (bhabbā), and the other not so capable (abhabbā). The 
bhabbā, he saw, could be divided into six groups&nbsp;-&nbsp; the rāgacaritā and 
the dosa moha vitakka saddhā buddhi caritā, according to temperament. To these, 
respectively, he preached six suttas, calculated to benefit each separate class, 
and, in order that each sutta might take the form of question and answer, he 
created a Buddha form to ask questions, while he himself answered them. The six 
suttas, so preached, were the <a href="purabheda.htm" title="pu/purabheda.htm">Purābheda</a>, 
<a href="kalahavivaada_s.htm" title="ka/kalahavivaada_s.htm">Kalahavivāda</a>, 
<a href="cuula_viyuuha.htm" title="c/cuula_viyuuha.htm">Cūlavyūha</a>, Mahāvyūha, 
<a href="tuvataka_s.htm" title="t/tuvataka_s.htm">Tuvataka</a> and 
<a href="sammaparibbajaniya_s.htm" title="sa/sammaparibbajaniya_s.htm">Sammāparibbājaniya</a>. Countless numbers of beings realized the Truth 
(AA.i.173, 320; Mil. 20, 350; SNA.i.174).</p>
<p>The preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta was among the 
incidents of the Buddha’s life sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the
