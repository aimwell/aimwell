<p><b>1. Sudarī-Nandā. </b>Younger sister of Thullanandā; she had 
two other sisters, Nandā and Nandavatī. Sālha Migāranattā (q.v.) secduced her, 
and she was proclaimed guilty of a Parājikā offence (Vin.iv.211f). She was also 
blamed for her greediness as regards food. Vin.iv.232f., 234.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sundarī-Nandā.</b> A Therī. She was the daughter of 
<a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a> and
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpatī</a> and sister of 
<a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda Thera</a>. Seeing that most of her 
kinsmen had joined the Order, she too became a nun, not from faith, but from 
love of her kin. Being intoxicated with her own beauty, she did not go to see 
the Buddha lest he should rebuke her. The rest of her story is very similar to 
that of <a href="abhiruupa_nandaa_theri.htm" title="am/abhiruupa_nandaa_theri.htm">Abhirūpa Nandā</a>. The Buddha preached to her and she became a sotāpanna. He then gave her a topic of meditation, and she, developing insight, 
became an arahant. Later she was declared foremost among nuns in power of 
meditation, an eminence which she had resolved to obtain in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha. Thag.vs.82-6; ThigA.80f.; Ap.ii.572f; A.i.25; AA.i.198f.</p>
<p>She seems to have been called Rūpanandā (AA.i.198) too; 
there seems to have been some confusion in the legends of the different Therīs 
named Nandā.</p>
