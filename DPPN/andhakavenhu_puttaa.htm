<p>Ten brothers, sons of <a href="devagabbhaa.htm" title="d/devagabbhaa.htm">Devagabbhā</a> and 
<a href="upasaagara.htm" title="u/upasaagara.htm">Upasāgara</a>.</p>
<p>As it had been foretold at Devagabbhā’s 
birth that one of her sons would destroy the lineage of 
<a href="kamsa.htm" title="ka/kamsa.htm">Kamsa</a>, each time a son 
was born to her, fearing lest he be put to death, she sent him secretly to her 
serving-woman, <a href="nandagopa.htm" title="n/nandagopa.htm">Nandagopā</a>; the latter had married 
<a href="andhakavenhu.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu.htm">Andhakavenhu</a> and, by good 
fortune, daughters were born to her at the same time as sons to Devagabbhā; 
these daughters she sent to Devagabbhā in exchange for the latter’s sons.</p>
<p>The ten sons were named <a href="vaasudeva.htm" title="va/vaasudeva.htm">Vāsudeva</a>, 
Baladeva, Candadeva, Suriyadeva, <a href="aggideva.htm" title="am/aggideva.htm">Aggideva</a>, Varunadeva, Ajjuna, Pajjuna, 
Ghatapandita and Ankura. Cowell sees in this story the kernel of a nature-myth 
(Jātaka, trans. iv. 51 n. ); cf. with this the Krsna legend in the Harivamsa; 
see also Wilson’s Visnu Purāna (Hall’s Ed.), v. 147f.; and the article on Krsna 
in Hopkins' Epic Mythology, pp.214f. </p>
<p>They had also a sister, <a href="anjanadevi.htm" title="ay/anjanadevi.htm">Añjanadevī</a>. When 
they grew up they became highway robbers, seizing even a present sent to their 
uncle, King Kamsa. Thus they became notorious as the Andakavenhudāsaputtā. The 
king, having learnt of their true descent, devised various plans for their 
destruction. Two famous wrestlers, Cānura and Mutthika, were engaged to have a 
public wrestling match with them. The brothers accepted the challenge and looted 
several shops for clothes, perfumes, etc., to be used for the occasion. Baladeva 
killed both the wrestlers. In his death-throes Mutthika uttered a prayer to be 
born as a Yakkha; his wish was fulfilled and he was born as such in the 
Kālamattiya forest. When the king’s men attempted to seize the brothers, 
Vāsudeva threw a wheel which cut off the heads of both the king and his brother 
the viceroy, Upakamsa.</p>
<p>The populace, terrified, begged the 
brothers to be their guardians. Thereupon they assumed the sovereignty of 
<a href="asitanjana.htm" title="ay/asitanjana.htm">Asitañjana</a>. From there they set out to conquer the whole of Jambudīpa, starting 
with Ayojjhā (whose king, <a href="kaalasena.htm" title="ka/kaalasena.htm">Kālasena</a>, they took prisoner) and Dvāravatī, which 
they captured with the help of <a href="kanhadiipayana.htm" title="ka/kanhadiipayana.htm">Kanhadīpayana</a>.</p>
<p>They made Dvāravatī their capital and 
divided their kingdom into ten shares, forgetting their sister, Añjanadevī. When 
they discovered their mistake, Ankura gave her his share and took to trade. 
Ankura’s later history is found in PvA.111ff. See <a href="ankura.htm" title="ay/ankura.htm">Ankura</a>.</p>
<p>In course of time the brothers had many 
sons and daughters, the average human age at that time being 20,000 years. Later 
their sons annoyed the sage Kanhadīpāyana by dressing up a lad as a woman and 
asking him what child she would bring forth. “A knot of acacia wood,” he 
answered, “with which will be destroyed the line of Vasudeva.”</p>
<p>They laughed at the sage and kicked him. 
On the seventh day the lad voided from his belly a knot of acacia wood which 
they burnt, casting the ashes into the river. From those ashes, which stuck near 
the citygate, an Eraka-plant sprang up. One day, while disporting themselves in 
the water, the kings, with their families and followers, started a sham quarrel 
and plucked leaves from the Eraka-plant to use as clubs. The leaves turned into 
weapons in their hands, and they were all killed except Vāsudeva, Baladeva, 
Añjanadevī, and their chaplain, all of whom fled in a chariot. Thus were the 
words of the sage fulfilled.</p>
<p>In their flight they reached the 
Kālamattiya forest in which Mutthika had been born as a Yakkha. When Mutthika 
saw Baladeva he assumed the shape of a wrestler and challenged him to a fight. 
Baladeva accepted the challenge and “was gobbled up like a radish-bulb.”</p>
<p>Vāsudeva proceeded on his way with the 
others and at night lay in a bush for shelter. A huntsman, mistaking him for a 
pig, speared him; when Vāsudeva heard that the huntsman’s name was Jarā (Old 
Age) he reconciled himself to death. Thus they all perished except Añjanadevī 
(J.iv.79ff), of whose later history nothing is mentioned.</p>
<p>In 
the <a href="kumbha_jat_512.htm" title="ku/kumbha_jat_512.htm">Kumbha Jātaka</a> (J.v. p.18) it is suggested that the Andhakavenhus were 
destroyed as a result of indulging in drink. This story was evidently well known 
to tradition as it is so often referred to. E.g., in the 
<a href="sankicca_jat_530.htm" title="sa/sankicca_jat_530.htm">Sankicca Jāt</a>. (v. 267) 
and in Vv., p.58. </p>
