<p>A village near Kālavallimandapa. Two 
brahmins of Pātaliputta, having heard of the fame of Mahānāga Thera of 
Kālavallimandapa, set out to see him. One died on the way; the other went to 
Anurādhapura and, hearing there that the Thera resided in Rohana, journeyed 
there and took up his abode in Cūlanagaragāma, near the vihāra. AA.i.384.</p>
