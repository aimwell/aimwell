</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta, son of <a href="okkaaka.htm" title="o/okkaaka.htm">Okkāka</a>, king of
<a href="kusaavaatii.htm" title="ku/kusaavaatii.htm">Kusāvatī</a> and of his queen 
<a href="siilavati.htm" title="s/siilavati.htm">Sīlavatī</a>. Okkāka has no heir, in spite of performing 
various rites. But at length, by the favour of Sakka, Sīlavatī miraculously 
gives birth to two sons. The elder, though ill-favoured, is supernaturally wise 
and is called Kusa. The younger, very handsome, is called Jayampati. Kusa 
consents to marry only on condition that a princess can be obtained exactly like 
an image which he himself has fashioned. <a href="pabhavati.htm" title="pa/pabhavati.htm">Pabhāvatī</a>, daughter of King 
<a href="madda.htm" title="ma/madda.htm">Madda</a> of 
<a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sāgala</a>, is found to fulfil this condition, and is married to Kusa. The bride is 
not to look upon her husband’s face until she has conceived, but Kusa plays 
various pranks upon her and she accidentally discovers how ugly he is. She 
leaves him immediately and returns to her father’s court. Thither Kusa follows 
her, and under a variety of menial disguises, including that of a cook, tries, 
but in vain, to win her affection. At length <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> intervenes. He sends letters, 
purporting to come from King Madda, to seven kings, offering Pabhāvatī to each 
of them. They arrive in Sāgala simultaneously and threaten to destroy the city. 
Madda decides to cut Pabhāvatī into seven pieces, and she is only saved from 
immediate death by the despised husband. At his appearance the kings flee, for 
wherever he looks the earth trembles. Kusa returns with his wife to Kusāvatī and 
they live there happily.</p>
<p>Pleased at Kusa’s victory, Sakka gives 
him a jewel called the Verocanamani. It was octagonal, and was evidently handed 
down in the succession of kings, for we are told that one of the tests, set by 
Videha, king of Mithilā, to discover the proficiency of Mahosadha, was for him 
to break the old thread in this gem, remove it, and insert a new one. (J.vi.340; 
according to SA.i.115 and DA.iii.266, the jewel was also in the possession of 
Pasenadi; but see the <a href="mahasara_jat_092.htm" title="maha/mahasara_jat_092.htm">Mahāsāra Jātaka</a>, where no mention is made of Kusa). 
 
</p>
<p>Reference is made elsewhere (E.g., MT.552) to a tālavanta (fan?) possessed by 
Kusa, in which could be seen the forms of all things in the world. He also 
possessed the Kokanadavīnā (q.v.) given by Sakka to Sīlavatī.  </p>
<p>Kusa is called 
Sīhassara, and his shout, when he appeared before the seven kings, announcing 
his name, was one of the four shouts heard throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; 
SA.i.248).  </p>
<p>The Dīpavamsa (iii.40) speaks of Kusa and Mahākusa, both descended 
from Mahāsammata.</p>
