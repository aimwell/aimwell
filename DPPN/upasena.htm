<p>1. Upasena Thera.-Maternal 
uncle of Vijitasena Thera and brother of Sena. He was an elephant-trainer, and 
having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and, in due course, became 
an arahant. He ordained Vijitasena (ThagA.i.424). According to the Mahāvastu 
(iii.60ff), Sāriputta was converted to Buddhism not by Assaji, as recorded in 
the Pitakas, but by an Elder named Upasena, who is, perhaps, to be identified 
with the Upasena. The Mahāvastu (iii.431f) also mentions an Upasena who was 
nephew to the Tebhātika Jatilas. When the Tebhātikas accepted the Buddha as 
their teacher, they cast the garments, etc., which they had used as ascetics, 
into the Nerañjarā, on the banks of which was Upasena’s hermitage. When Upasena 
saw the robes, etc., he knew that something must have happened to his uncles. He 
went at once to see them and, having heard the good tidings of their new-found 
bliss became a monk himself. It is not stated whether this Upasena is identical 
with the Elder of the same name mentioned above as the teacher of Sāriputta.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Upasena Vangantaputta.-He was born 
in. Nālaka as the son of Rūpasārī, the brahminee, his father being Vanganta. He 
was the younger brother of Sāriputta (UdA.266; DhA.ii.188). When he came of age, 
he learnt the three Vedas, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the 
Order. When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to 
increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha. The 
Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure (Vin.i.59; Sp.i.194; 
J.ii.449), and Upasena, wishing to earn the Master’s praise on account of the 
very cause of this rebuke, practised insight and became an arahant. Thereafter 
he adopted various dhutangas and persuaded others to do likewise. In a short 
time he had a large retinue, each member of which was charming in his way, and 
the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming 
(samantapāsādikānam) (A.i.24). Buddhaghosa says that Upasena was famed as a very 
clever preacher (pathavighutthadhammakathika), and many joined him because of 
his eloquence. AA.i.152; also Mil.360, where more details are given of how 
Upasena admitted monks into the Order and of the conditions imposed on them; for 
a slightly different version see Vin.iii.230ff; it is said there that after 
Upasena’s visit, the Buddha allowed monks who practised dhutangas, to visit him 
even during his periods of retreat. See also Sp.iii.685f.</p>
<p>He visited the Buddha when the Buddha 
had enjoined on himself a period of solitude for a fortnight; the monks had 
agreed that anyone who went to see the Buddha would be guilty of a pācittiya 
offence, but the Buddha, desiring to talk to him, asked one of Upasena’s 
followers if he liked rag-robes. “No, Sir, but I wear them out of regard for my 
teacher,” was the reply.</p>
<p>In the Theragāthā are found several 
verses ascribed to Upasena as having been spoken by him in answer to a question 
by his saddhivihdrika, regarding what was to be done during the dissensions of 
the Kosambī monks (vv. 577-86; the first verse is quoted in the Milinda 371 and 
also the fifth 395). The Milinda-pañha (pp.393, 394) contains several other 
verses attributed to Upasena similar in their trend of ideas and admonitions. 
The Udāna states (p.45f; UdA.266ff) that once when he was taking his siesta he 
reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the 
guidance of the Buddha. The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.</p>
<p>One day, while Upasena was sitting after 
his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbhāra, fanned by the gentle 
breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils 
overhanging the cave. One fell on his shoulder and bit him, and the venom spread 
rapidly throughout his body; he called to Sāriputta and other monks who were 
near, and requested that he might be taken outside on a couch, there to die. 
This was done, and his body “was scattered there and then like a handful of 
chaff.” (S.iv.40f; SA.iii.10).</p>
<p>Upasena had been, in Padumuttara’s day, 
a householder of Hamsavatī. One day he heard the Buddha declare one of his monks 
to be the best of those who were altogether charming, and wished for a similar 
declaration regarding himself by some future Buddha. Towards this end he did 
many deeds of piety (ThagA.i.525). The Apadāna mentions that he gave a meal to 
Padumuttara and eight monks, and at the meal placed over the Buddha’s head a 
parasol made of kanikdra-flowers. As a result, he was thirty times king of the 
devas and twenty-one times cakkavatti. (Ap.i.62). The verses quoted from the 
Apadāna in the ThagA. are slightly different.</p>
<p>Upasena is given, together with Yasa 
Kākandakaputta, as an example of one who observed the Vinaya precepts 
thoroughly, without imposing any new rules or agreements. DA.ii.525.</p>
<p>See also Vaka Jātaka.</p>

<p>3. Upasena Thera.-Mentioned in the 
Gandhavamsa (61, 66; also Svd.1197) as the author of the Saddhammappajjotikā, 
the commentary on the Mahā Niddesa. But see Upatissa (13).</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Upasena.-Son of Sujāta Buddha. 
Bu.xiii.22.</p>
