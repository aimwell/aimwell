</ul>
<p>A 
village near the Cālikapabbata, where the Buddha spent the vassas of the 
thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth years after the Enlightenment (BuA.3).
</p>
<p>
His attendant on one of these visits was Meghiya. Close to Cālikā was the 
village of Jantu where Meghiya went for alms. In the neighbourhood was the river 
Kimikālā, on whose banks was a mango grove (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1; DhA.i.287f).
</p>
<p>
Outside the city gate and all around the city was a bog (cala-panka), owing to 
which the city gave the impression of moving, hence the name (UdA.217; 
AA.ii.793). v.l. Jālikā. </p>
