<p>A conversation between Ānanda and a 
householder, a follower of the Ājīvakas. The householder questions Ānanda as to 
whose doctrine is well taught, who are the rightly conducted and who are the 
welfarers in the world. Ānanda tells him the characteristics which are helpful 
in arriving at a decision on these questions, without praising one’s own creed 
or decrying another’s. The man expresses great satisfaction. A.i.217ff.</p>
