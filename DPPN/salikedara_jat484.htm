<p>Once, when King <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> was reigning in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, the 
Bodhisatta was a parrot and looked after his aged parents. When the fields of 
the brahmin <a href="kosiya.htm" title="ku/kosiya.htm">Kosiyagotta</a>, of Sālindiya in Magadha, were ripe, the parrot went 
there with his flock, and, having fed himself, took some corn for his parents. 
The watchman of the fields reported this to Kosiyagotta, and, on his 
instructions, a snare was set and the Bodhisatta caught. When he raised the 
alarm, the other parrots fled. The Bodhisatta explained to Kosiyagotta why he 
carried the corn away&nbsp;- to feed his parents, his young ones, and those 
who were in need, thus, as it were, paying a debt, giving a loan, and setting up 
a store of merit. The brahmin was very pleased, and gave permission to the 
Bodhisatta to take the corn of all his thousand acres; but the Bodhisatta 
accepted only eight (J. iv.276 82).</p>
