<p>A thera credited with great iddhi-power. 
He lived in Mangana, and was one of those who shared the sour millet-gruel given 
by Dutthagāmani in his flight from battle. Khuddaka Tissa divided it among sixty 
thousand monks in the Kelāsa Vihāra (Mhv.xxxii.53f). He was one of the 
pacchāgatakā (late comers?) to the Assemblies of Kuddālaka, Mūgapakkha, Ayoghara, 
and Hatthipāla (J.vi.30). He is probably identical with Kujja Tissa (q.v.).</p>
