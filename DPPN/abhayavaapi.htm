<p>A tank in Anurādhapura built by King 
Pandukābhaya (Mhv.x.88). At its lower end was the settlement of the yakkha 
Cittarāja (Mhv.x.84).  </p>
<p>In the hot weather it ran dry, and on one occasion Devānampiyatissa used its mud for building a temporary structure in which to 
deposit the relics brought from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xvii.35).  </p>
<p>The hall which Dutthagāmani built round the Maricavatti Vihāra extended into a part of the 
Abhaya tank (Mhv.xxvi.20).  </p>
<p>In the reign of Bhātikābhaya water was taken from the 
tank, by means of machines, up to the top of the Mahā Thūpa, for the sprinkling 
of the flowers offered there (Mhv.xxxiv.45).  </p>
<p>The tank is generally identified 
with the modern Basavakkulam (Geiger, Mhv. trans. 74, n.3).</p>
