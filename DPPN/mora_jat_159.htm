<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a golden peacock and lived 
on a golden hill in Dandaka. He used to recite one spell in honour of the sun 
and another in praise of the Buddhas, and thus he was protected from all harm. 
Khemā, queen of Benares, saw in a dream a golden peacock preaching. She longed 
for the dream to come true and told it to the king. He made enquiries, and sent 
hunters to catch the golden peacock, but they failed. Khemā died of grief, and 
the king, in his anger, inscribed on a golden plate that anyone eating the flesh 
of the golden peacock would be immortal. His successors, seeing the inscription, 
sent out hunters, but they, too, failed to catch the Bodhisatta.  </p>
<p>Six kings in 
succession failed in this quest. The seventh engaged a hunter who, having 
watched the Bodhisatta, trained a peahen to cry at the snap of his finger. The 
hunter laid his snare, went with the peahen and made her cry. Instantly, the 
golden peacock forgot his spell and was caught in the snare. When he was led 
before the king and told the reason for his capture, he agreed with the king 
that his golden colour was owing to good deeds done in the past as king of that 
very city, and that he was a peacock owing to some sin he had committed. The 
eating of his flesh could not make anyone young or immortal, seeing that he 
himself was not immortal. Being asked to prove his words, he had the lake near 
the city dredged, when the golden chariot in which he used to ride was 
discovered. The king thereupon paid him great honour and led him back to Dandaka.</p>
<p>The story was told to a backsliding monk who was upset by 
the sight of a woman magnificently attired.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with the king of Benares (J.ii.33 8; 
the story is alluded to at J.iv.414). See also Moraparitta.</p>
