<h2>Upasālha Jātaka (No. 166)</h2>
<p>Preached to Upasālha. The story of the 
past is that of a brahmin Upasālhaka (identified with Upasālha). He instructed 
his son that after death he should be burnt in a cemetery unpolluted by the 
presence of outcasts. While descending Gijjhakūta, having ascended the mountain 
in order to find such a spot, they met the Bodhisatta, who was a holy ascetic, 
possessed of various attainments and mystic powers. When the Bodhisatta had 
heard their story, he revealed to them that on that very same spot Upasālha had 
been burnt fourteen thousand times, and preached to them the way of 
deathlessness (J.ii.54ff).</p>
<p>The Upasālhaka Jātaka was preached by 
the Buddha to the novice Vanavāsī-Tissa when the Buddha visited him in his 
forest solitude. DhA.ii.99.</p>
