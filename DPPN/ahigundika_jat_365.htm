<p>The story of a snake-charmer in Benares 
who had also a tame monkey. Once, during a festival, he left the monkey with a 
corn-factor (the Bodhisatta) and set out to earn money by making sport with the 
snake. The monkey was well looked after by the Bodhisatta. Seven days later the 
snake-charmer returned drunk and ill-treated the monkey. When the man was asleep 
the monkey escaped and refused to come back in spite of his former owner’s fine 
words.</p>
<p>The story was told with reference to a 
novice who was ordained by a distinguished Elder. The Elder ill-treated the lad 
who, in exasperation, left the Order. The Elder persuaded him to return, but 
when this had happened twice again, the lad refused to come back (J.iii.197-9). 
The novice is identified with the monkey of the story.</p>
