<p>King of Ceylon for twenty nine years (between 362 and 409 
A.C.) He was the son of Jetthatissa and led a very pious life. He was renowned 
as a great physician, and various miraculous cures are attributed to him, even 
snakes seeking his assistance. A jewel, which he received from a snake in 
gratitude for a cure, he placed in the stone image in the Abhayagiri vihāra.
</p>
<p>A medical work, the Sāratthasangaha, in Sanskrit, is 
ascribed to him (but see Cv. Trs. 13, n. 7). It is said that he appointed a 
royal physician for every ten villages, and established hospitals for the 
crippled and for the dumb and also for animals. He appointed preachers to look 
after the people’s spiritual welfare. </p>
<p>Among religious buildings erected by him was the 
Moraparivena. He extended his patronage to a holy monk, named Mahādhammakathī, 
who translated the suttas into Singhalese. </p>
<p>Buddhadāsa had eighty sons, named after the Buddha’s 
eminent disciples, the eldest being Upatissa II. who succeeded him.
