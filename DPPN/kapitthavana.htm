<p>A park on the banks of the Godhāvarī and 
the residence of Bāvarī (ThagA.i.73). According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.581) it 
was an island (antaradīpa) in the fork of the river, and was three leagues in 
extent. It lay between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka, and was purchased from 
these two kings for two thousand pieces. The kings gave another two leagues to 
Bāvarī as a gift. The park had been the residence of holy men of old, such as 
Sarabhahga (J.v.132) and Sālissara (J.iii.463; see also Mtu.iii.363), and it was 
called Kapitthavana from being covered with kapittha-trees (elephant apple) — 
v.l. Kavitthavana, Kapitthakavana.</p>
