<p>1. Uparevata.-A sāmanera, son of 
Padumuttara Buddha. It was the sight of this novice which made Rāhula, then born 
as the Nāga-king Sankha, wish to become a Buddha’s son (SnA.i.340; MA.ii.722). 
According to the Buddhavamsa (xi.21), however, Padumuttara’s son was called 
Uttara. Uparevata, though very young in years (tarunalalitadāraka), was 
possessed of great iddhi-powers and the Nāga-king was greatly impressed by him 
(AA.i.142f. Here the nāga king is called Pathayindhara).</p>
<p>2. Uparevata.-Nephew of Sāriputta. When 
Sāriputta went to Nālaka on his last visit, in order to die there, Uparevata saw 
him outside the village, seated under a banyan tree. He was asked to announce 
Sāriputta’s arrival to the latter’s mother, and to make preparations for 
accommodating Sāriputta’s five hundred followers (DA.ii.551; SA.iii.175).</p>
