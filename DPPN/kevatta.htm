<p>1. Kevatta (v.l. Kevaddha).-A 
householder of Nālandā. Once when the Buddha was staying in the 
Pāvārika-ambavana at Nālandā, Kevatta visited him. The interview is recorded in 
the Kevatta Sutta. (D.i.211ff).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (DA.i.388) speaks of him as 
a young householder, distinguished and wealthy, belonging to the 
gahapati-mahā-sala-kula, with forty crores of wealth. He was possessed of very 
great piety, and it was his extreme devotion to the Buddha which led him to make 
the request contained in the Kevatta Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kevatta.-Chaplain of 
Cūlani-Brahmadatta, king of Uttarapañcāla. He was wise and learned and clever in 
device; the king followed his counsel and conquered all the territories of India 
except that of King Videha in Mithilā (J.vi.391-5). When at last Brahmadatta 
laid siege to Mithilā, Kevatta was responsible for the details of the siege, but 
his plans were upset by Mahosadha, who, though his junior in age, was far wiser. 
At one stage of the struggle Kevatta suggested that a trial of intellect be 
arranged between him and Mahosadha, the result of the conquest to decide the 
victory of Brahmadatta or Videha. The challenge was accepted, but Mahosadha, by 
a ruse, made Kevatta appear as though paying obeisance to him and rubbed 
Kevatta’s head in the dust, bruising it. After the return, in disgrace, of 
Brahmadatta to Uttarapañcāla, Kevatta meditated revenge through the 
instrumentality of Pañcāla-candī. Kevatta visited Mithilā with a proposal that 
Videha should go to Uttarapañcāla and marry Pañcālacandī. During this visit, 
Kevatta went to visit Mahosadha, but the latter, guessing that the whole thing 
was a plot to kill Videha, refused to see Kevatta and caused him to be 
ill-treated (J.vi.400-19). Kevatta was everywhere defeated in his schemes by 
Mahosadha. J.vi.424, 438, 461; for details see the Mahā Umagga Jātaka.</p>
<p>Kevatta is identified with Devadatta 
(J.vi.478). He is mentioned as having belonged to the Kosiyagotta and is 
addressed as Kosiya. J.vi.418, 419.</p>
