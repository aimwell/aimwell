<p><b>1. Sakulā Therī. </b>She belonged to a brahmin family 
of Sāvatthi and became a believer on seeing the Buddha accept Jetavana. Later, 
she heard an arahant monk preach, and, being agitated in mind, joined the Order. 
Having developed insight, she won arahantship. Afterwards the Buddha declared 
her foremost among nuns in dibbacakkhu (A.i.25).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was Nandā, daughter 
of King Ānanda, and, therefore, half sister of the Buddha. One day she heard the 
Buddha declare a nun chief among possessors of the “heavenly eye” and herself 
wished for similar honour. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was a brahminee and 
later became a Paribbājikā. One day she offered alms at the Buddha’s thūpa and 
kept a lamp burning there all night. She was then reborn in Tāvatimsa. Thig. 
vss.98 101; ThigA.91f.; Ap.ii.569f.; AA.i.199f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sakulā.</b> Sister of Somā. They were both wives of 
Pasenadi and followers of the Buddha. Once, when Pasenadi was staying at Ujjuñña, 
he went to see the Buddha, and carried to him the greetings of the two queens. 
M.ii.125f.; MA.ii.757.</p>
