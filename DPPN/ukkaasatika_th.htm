<p>An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago he 
had seen the Pacceka Buddha Kosika, in Himav훮, engaged in meditation, and for 
seven days he had one hundred torches kept lighted near the Buddha. On the 
eighth day he gave alms to the Pacceka Buddha. As a result he was born in Tusita, 
and from his body rays of light issued, spreading one hundred leagues. 
</p>
<p>Fifty-five kappas ago he reigned as king 
of Jambud카pa, with his capital in Sobhana, built by Vissakamma himself, entirely 
of gold. Ap.ii.414-15.</p>
