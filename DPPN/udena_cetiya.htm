  <h2>Udena Cetiya</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A shrine of pre-Buddhistic worship, to 
the east of Vesāli. </p>
<p>It is mentioned with other shrines at 
Vesāli — </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Gotamaka, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Sārandada, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Sattamba, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Cāpāla and </li>
  <li>
  <p>Bahuputta — </li>
</ul>
<p>all of which are described as beautiful 
spots (D.ii.102; S.v.260; A.iv.309; see also D.iii.9). </p>
<p>Rhys Davids conjectures that these were 
probably trees or barrows (Dial.ii.110, n.1, but see Law: Geography of Early 
Buddhism. 74ff). </p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (iii.246) 
describes the Udena and the Gotamaka shrines as “rukkha-cetiyas” to which men 
pay homage in order to have their wishes fulfilled. </p>
<p>The Digha Commentary (ii.554; AA.ii.784; 
UdA.323) says that in the Buddha’s time a vihāra had been erected on the spot 
where this shrine stood and that this vihāra had previously been dedicated to 
the Yakkha Udena.</p>
