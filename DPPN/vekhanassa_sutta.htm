<p>Vekhanassa visits the Buddha at Jetavana and argues about 
perfection. As in the <a href="cuula_sakuladaayi_s.htm" title="c/cuula_sakuladaayi_s.htm">Culla 
Sakuladāyī Suttas</a>, the Buddha says that what Vekhanassa defines as perfection is merely a refinement of pleasure, and that 
only arahants can grasp the real meaning of perfection. Vekhanassa is annoyed, 
but the Buddha soothes him, and he becomes the Buddha’s follower (M.ii.40ff).</p>
<p>In 
the sutta Vekhanassa is called Kaccāna. The Commentary (MA.ii.716) says that 
Vekhanassa visited the Buddha because he wished to discover for himself why his 
favourite pupil, <a href="sakuladaayii.htm" title="sa/sakuladaayii.htm">Sakuludāyī</a>, should have been defeated by the Buddha; he, 
therefore, travelled all the way from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, a distance of forty 
five leagues, to see the Buddha.</p>
