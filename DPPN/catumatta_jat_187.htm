<p>Two geese from Cittakūta once used a 
certain tree as a perch, whenever they approached it, and became friendly with 
the spirit of the tree, who was the Bodhisatta. They talked together about 
religion until a jackal came and interrupted them. Then the geese flew away and 
did not return.</p>
<p>The story was told of an old monk who 
interrupted a conversation between Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The monk was the 
jackal. J.ii.106f.</p>
