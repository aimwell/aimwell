<hr>
<p><b>1. Siddhattha.</b>-The sixteenth of the twenty four 
Buddhas. He was born in the Viriya pleasance in the city of Vebhāra, his father 
being the khattiya Udena and his mother Suphassā. At the time of his birth all 
enterprises succeeded, hence his name. He lived as a householder for ten 
thousand years in three palaces — Kokā, Suppala and Kokanuda, (Paduma) — his 
wife being Sumanā (Somanassā) and his son Anupama. He left home in a golden 
palanquin, practised austerities for ten months, had milk rice given to him by a 
brahmin maiden, Sunettā of Asadisa, and grass for his seat by a Yavapāla, Varuna. 
His bodhi was a kanikāra, and his first sermon was preached at Gayā. The 
Bodhisatta was an ascetic named Mangala, of Surasena. Samphala and Sumitta were 
his chief disciples among monks, and Sīvalā and Sarāmā among nuns, while Revata 
was his attendant. Chief among his laypatrons were Suppiya and Samudda and Rammā 
and Surammā. His body was sixty cubits high. He lived for one hundred thousand 
years, and died in the Anomārāma in the city of Anoma. His thūpa was four 
leagues in height. Bu.xvii.; BuA.185ff.; J.i.49.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>3. Siddhattha.</b>-An eminent monk in the time of 
Dutthagāmanī. Foreseeing dangers lying ahead, he prevented the king from marking
