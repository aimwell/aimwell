  <h2>Malitavambha Thera</h2>

<p>He was the son of a brahmin of Bhārukaccha and entered the 
Order under Pacchābhū Thera. It is said that he preferred to live where no 
conveniences, except food, were available, and before long he became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a bird named 
Kakudha living on a lake, and, seeing the Buddha walking along the edge of the 
lake, he offered him kumudu flowers. </p>
<p>One hundred and sixteen kappas ago he was king eight times 
under the name of Varuna (Thag.vs.105; ThagA.i.210f). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Kumudadāyaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.180.</p>
