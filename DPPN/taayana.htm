<p>A devaputta. He visited the Buddha at 
Sāvatthi and uttered certain verses in the hearing of the monks, telling of the 
necessity of following the recluse’s calling with energy and sincerity. After 
his departure the Buddha asked the monks to learn the verses for their own good 
(S.i.49).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.85) says that he 
was once a dissentient teacher, like Nanda, Vaccha, Kisa, Sankicca, etc., and 
taught some of the sixty-two views enumerated in the Brahmajāla Sutta. By the 
power of good deeds and by believing in Kamma, he was reborn in the heavens. 
Discerning from there that at length a really saving Dhamma and Order had been 
founded, he came to incite the Buddha’s disciples.</p>
