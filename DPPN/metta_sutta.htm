<p><b>1. Metta Sutta. </b>One should be diligent and upright, 
gentle and not vain glorious, free from deceit. Let none, out of anger, or 
through resentment, wish misery to another. A person should cherish boundless 
goodwill towards all beings, like a mother fostering her only son. SN.vss.143-52; also Khp.p.8f.; where it is called Karaniyametta Sutta, by which name it is 
more popularly known.</p>
<p>This sutta was preached by the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> to five hundred 
monks who had obtained from him a formula for meditation and dwelt in a region 
in the Himālaya. The gods there were alarmed by the goodness of the monks and 
tried to frighten them away. The monks, constantly harassed, sought the Buddha 
at Sāvatthi. He preached this sutta to them and admonished them on the practice 
of goodwill. They followed his advice, and the gods, understanding, left them in 
peace (KhpA.232ff.; cp. DhA.i.313ff). </p>
<p>The sutta is included in the <a href="paritta.htm" title="pa/paritta.htm">Parittas</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Metta Sutta. </b>Once when the Buddha was at 
<a href="haliddavasana.htm" title="h/haliddavasana.htm">Haliddavasana</a>, a discussion arose between some monks and some 
<a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājakas</a> as to 
whether there was any difference between their respective doctrines since they 
both inculcated the practice of goodwill, compassion, sympathy, and equanimity. 
The monks consulted the Buddha, who told them that the Paribbājakas were 
ignorant of how to cultivate these qualities, of what was their goal and their 
excellence, their fruit and their ending.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to explain to them that these are 
cultivated through the seven bojjhanga; goodwill has the “beautiful” for its 
excellence, compassion the infinity of space, sympathy the infinity of 
consciousness, and equanimity the sphere where nought exists. (S.v.115f).</p>
