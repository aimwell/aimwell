<p>The Buddha questions Sāriputta at Sūkarakhatalena as to 
why a monk who has destroyed the āsavas should revere the Buddha and his 
teachings. Sāriputta answers that it is because such a monk has secured freedom 
from the yoke. “What kind of security is it?” asks the Buddha, and Sāriputta 
explains that it is security obtained by the cultivation of the five indriyas of 
faith, energy, etc. S.v.233f.</p>
