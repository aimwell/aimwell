<p>The nineteenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in 
the Khema park in Bandhumatī, his father being Bandhumā and his mother 
Bandhumatī. He belonged to the Kondañña gotta. For eight thousand years he lived 
as a householder in three palaces: Nanda, Sunanda and Sirimā. His body was 
eighty cubits in height. His wife was Sutanā (v.l. Sudassanā) and his son 
Samavattakkhandha. He left the household in a chariot and practised austerities 
for eight months. Just before his enlightenment, the daughter of Sudassana 
setthi gave him milk rice, while a yavapālaka named Sujāta gave grass for his 
seat. His bodhi was a pātali tree. He preached his first sermon in Khemamigadāya 
to his step brother Khandha and his purohita’s son Tissa; these two later became 
his chief disciples. His constant attendant was Asoka; Candā and Candamittā were 
his chief women disciples. His chief lay patrons were Punabbasummitta and Nāga 
among men, and Sirimā and Uttarā among women. He died in Sumittārāma at the age 
of eighty thousand, and his relics were enshrined in a thūpa seven leagues in 
height. The Bodhisatta was a Nāga king named Atula. (Bu.xx.1ff.; BuA.195f.; 
D.ii.2ff).</p>
<p>Three reasons are given for the name of this Buddha 
(BuA.195; cf. DA.ii.454; SA.ii.15): (1) Because he could see as well by night as 
by day; (2) because he had broad eyes; (3) because he could see clearly after 
investigation. Vipassī held the uposatha only once in seven years (DhA.iii.236), 
but on such occasions the whole Sangha was present (Sp.i.186). The construction 
of a Gandhakuti for Vipassī brought Mendaka great glory in the present age. 
Mendaka’s name at the time was Avaroja (DhA.iii.364f). Aññākondañña was then 
known as Cūlakāla, and nine times he gave Vipassī Buddha the first fruits of his 
fields. DhA.i.81f.</p>
