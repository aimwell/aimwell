<p><b>1. Sārānīya Sutta.</b> A king must remember where he 
was born, where he was anointed, and where he won a battle. A monk must remember 
where he was ordained, where he realized the four Ariyan Truths, and where he 
attained arahantship. A.i.106f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sārinīya Suttā.</b> Two suttas on what a monk should 
bear in mind in order that his conduct shall endear him to others, bring 
concord, and lead to singleness of heart. A.iii.288f</p>
