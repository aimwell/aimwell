<p>A king and his country. The sixteen thousand brahmins who 
had enjoyed the patronage of Mandavya (q.v.), after they had lost caste through 
having eaten the leavings of Mātanga, went to live in Meghiyarattha, and Mātanga 
himself proceeded thither that he might humble their pride. The brahmins saw him 
and reported to the king that Mātanga was a juggler and a mountebank. The king, 
therefore, sent messengers to seize him. They found him sitting on a bench 
eating, and, approaching him from behind, struck him dead with their swords. The 
gods were enraged, and pouring down hot ashes on the kingdom utterly destroyed 
it (J.iv.388f; MA.ii.613ff). The country became a wilderness known as 
Mejjhārañña (E.g., M.i.378; J.v.114, 267; Mil.130).</p>
<p>The scene of the Vighāsa Jātaka is said to have been in 
Mejjhārañña (J.iii.310). The wilderness was also known as Mātangārañña, being 
connected with Mātanga. MA.ii.615.</p>
