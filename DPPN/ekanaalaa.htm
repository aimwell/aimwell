<p>A brahmin village near Dakkhinagiri, to 
the south of Rājagaha. Once, during the eleventh year of his ministry, the 
Buddha visited the village and preached to Kāsī-Bhāradvāja the sutta which bears 
his name and which converted him to the faith (Sn.pp.12ff; SnA.i.136; 
S.i.172ff). Near the village was the Dakkhinagiri-vihāra. SA.i.188.</p>
