<p>Once a merchant used to go about hawking goods, his pack 
carried by a donkey. After the day’s work he would throw a lion’s skin over the 
donkey and let him loose in the fields. The farmers, taking him for a lion, 
dared not stop him eating their crops. But one day they summoned up courage and 
armed themselves, and approached the animal with great uproar. The donkey, 
frightened to death, heehawed. The farmers cudgelled him to death.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Kokālika, who is 
identified with the donkey (J.ii.109f).</p>
