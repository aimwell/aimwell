<p>An elephant, one of the two chief 
consorts of Chaddanta, against whom she conceived a grudge because he preferred 
her rival to her. She gave gifts to a Pacceka Buddha and, as a result of her 
wish, she was born as Subhaddā, chief queen of the Madda king. She gave orders 
that Chaddanta’s tusks be brought to her, but the hunter to whom the task was 
entrusted killed the elephant, and on hearing of his death Subhaddā died of a 
broken heart.</p>
<p>For details see s.v. Chaddanta (4).</p>
