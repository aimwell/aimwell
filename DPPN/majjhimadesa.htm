  <h2>Majjhimadesa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The country of Central India which was the birthplace of 
Buddhism and the region of its early activities. It extended in the east to the 
town of Kajangala, beyond which was Mahāsāla; on the south-east 
to the river Salalavatī; on the south west to the town of Satakannika; on the 
west to the brahmin village of Thūna; on the north to the Usiraddhaja Mountain.
</p>
<p>Vin.i.197; J.i.49, 80; Mbv.12; Dvy.21f, extends the eastern 
boundary to include Pundavardhana, roughly identical with North Bengal. It is 
interesting to note that in early Brahminical literature (e.g. the Dharmasūtra 
of Baudhāyana), Āryāvarta, which is practically identical with what came to be 
called Madhyadesa, is described as lying to the east of the region where the 
Sarasvatī disappears, to the west of the Kālakavana, 
to the north of Pāripātra, and to the south of the Himālaya. This excludes the 
whole of Magadha (Baudhāyana i. 1, 2, 9, etc.).  </p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that in 
the Commentaries the Majjhimadesa is extended to include the whole of 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>, 
the other continents being Paccantima-janapadā. The 
term came also to be used in a generic sense. Thus, in Ceylon (Tambapannidīpa) 
<a href="anuraadhapura.htm" title="ay/anuraadhapura.htm">Anurādhapura</a> came to be called the Majjhimadesa (AA.i.165).</p>
<p>The Majjhimadesa was three hundred yojanas in length, two 
hundred and fifty in breadth, and nine hundred in circumference (DA.i.173). It 
contained fourteen of the sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a>, that is to say all but Gandhāra and Kamboja, which belonged to the 
<a href="uttaraapatha.htm" title="u/uttaraapatha.htm">Uttarāpatha</a>.  </p>
<p>The people of Majjhimadesa were regarded as wise and virtuous (J.iii.115, 116). It was the 
birthplace of noble men (purisājanīyā) including the Buddhas (DhA.iii.248; 
AA.i.265), and all kinds of marvellous things happened there (SNA.i.197). The 
people of Majjhimadesa considered peacocks' flesh a luxury. VibhA.10.</p>
