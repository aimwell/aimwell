  <h2>Kasī-Bhāradvāja</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, living 
at Ekanālā, in Dakkhināgiri. The Buddha visited him in the eleventh year after 
the Enlightenment (Thomas, op. cit., p.117). The brahmin was so called on 
account of his profession of agriculture. On the day of his festive sowing (mangalavappa), 
the Buddha visited him alone (having seen his upanissaya for arahantship), and 
stood near the place where food was being distributed to a very large number of 
people engaged in the festival. The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, 
suggests that the Buddha should work for his living — plough and sow just as he 
does. (The Sūtrālankāra says the brahmin threw water on the Buddha in order to 
drive him away; Sylvain Levy, JA.1908, xii.99). </p>
<p>The Buddha answers that he, too, is a 
farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly 
pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice. The Buddha refuses the 
gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons. At the 
Buddha’s own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is 
capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathāgata. (The food had become too 
rich because the gods had added ojā to it; see also Mil.231). When the rice 
touches the water it crackles and smokes and the brahmin, greatly marvelling, 
falls at the Buddha’s feet and professes himself henceforth the Buddha’s 
follower. Soon after, he enters the Order, and in due course becomes an arahant. 
Sn.12ff; SnA.131ff; the Samyutta does not mention his arahantship (S.i.171ff), 
though the Commentary does so (SA.i.188ff).</p>
