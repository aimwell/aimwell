<p>1. Andhakā.-Mentioned in a list of 
tribes that came to pay homage to Jatukannika Thera when he was born as a banker 
in Hamsavatī (Ap.ii.359). The Andhakarattha was on the banks of the Godhāvarī 
and near where Bāvarī lived. Assaka and Alaka, mentioned in the Vatthugāthā of 
the Parāyanavagga (Sn.977), are described in the Sutta Nipāta Commentary as 
Andhaka kings. SnA.ii.581; Vincent Smith places them originally in Eastern India 
between the Krsna and Godāvarī rivers (Z.D.M.G. 56, 657ff.); see also Burgess: 
Arch. Reports on W. India, ii.132 and iii.54. Cunningham: 603-607. </p>
<p>In the Aitareya Brahmana (vii.18) the 
Andhakas are mentioned together with the Pulindas, etc., as an outcast tribe. 
They again appear associated in the time of Asoka (Vincent Smith: Z.D.M.G. 56, 
652f). The Mahābhārata (xii.207, 42) places the Pulindas, the Andhas and the 
Sabaras in the Daksinapatha.</p>

<p>2. Andhakā.-An important group of monks 
that seceded from the Theravāda. They included as minor sects Pubbaseliyas, 
Aparaseliyas, Rājagirikas and Siddhatthikas (Points of Controversy, p. 104, 
extract from Kathāvatthu Cy.). They were still powerful in Buddhaghosa’s time 
(Ibid., xxxiv). The Andhakas are not mentioned as a special sect either in the 
Mahāvamsa or in the Dīpavamsa, though in the Mahāvamsa the sects spoken of above 
as offshoots of the Andhakas (Rājagiriyā, Siddhatthikā, Pubba- and Apara-seliyā) 
are given. (Mhv.v.12f.; also the Mbv.97) For a very valuable account of the 
different schools and their relation to each other, see Points of Controversy, 
pp. xxxv-xlv. About the Andhakas see particularly pp. xliii.ff. </p>
<p>There were various doctrines held by all 
the Andhakas either in common with other sects or alone, and various other 
doctrines held only by some of the minor groups of Andhakas. For a summary of 
these see Points of Controversy, pp. xx-xxiv.</p>
