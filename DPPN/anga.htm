<p><b>1. Anga</b>. (See also Angā).-One of the 
stock list of the sixteen Powers or Great Countries (<a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadā</a>), mentioned in 
the Pitakas. E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260. </p>
<p>The countries mentioned are Anga, 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, <a href="kaasi.htm" title="ka/kaasi.htm">Kāsī</a>, 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>, <a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajji</a>, 
<a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallā</a>, <a href="cetiya.htm" title="c/cetiya.htm">Cetī</a>, 
<a href="vamsaa.htm" title="va/vamsaa.htm">Vamsā</a>, <a href="kuru.htm" title="ku/kuru.htm">Kuru</a>, 
<a href="pancala.htm" title="pa/pancala.htm">Pañcāla</a>, <a href="macchaa.htm" title="ma/macchaa.htm">Macchā</a>, 
<a href="surasena.htm" title="s/surasena.htm">Sūrasena</a>, <a href="assaka.htm" title="ay/assaka.htm">Assaka</a>, 
<a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avantī</a>, <a href="gandhaara.htm" title="g/gandhaara.htm">Gandhāra</a>, and 
<a href="kamboja.htm" title="ka/kamboja.htm">Kamboja</a>. Other similar lists occur 
elsewhere, e.g. D.ii.200 (where ten countries are mentioned); see also Mtu.i.34 
and i.198; and Lal.24(22). </p>
<p>It was to the east of Magadha, from 
which it was separated by the River <a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, and had as its capital city Campā, 
near the modern Bhagalpur (Cunningham, pp. 546-7). Other cities mentioned are 
<a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya</a> (DA.i.279; DhA.i.384) and 
<a href="assapura.htm" title="ay/assapura.htm">Assapura</a> (M.i.271).</p>
<p>The country is generally referred to by 
the name of its people, the Angā, though occasionally (E.g., DhA.i.384) the name 
Angarattha is used. In the Buddha’s time it was subject to Magadha, 
(ThagA.i.548) whose king Bimbisāra was, we are told, held in esteem also by the 
people of Anga (MA.i.394), and the people of the two countries evidently used to 
pay frequent visits to each other (J.ii.211). We never hear of its having 
regained its former independence, and traditions of war between the two 
countries are mentioned (E.g., J.iv.454; J.v.316; J.vi.271).</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time the Angarājā was 
just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension 
to a Brahmin (M.ii.163). The people of Anga and Magadha are generally mentioned 
together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. 
They provide <a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Uruvela-Kassapa</a> with offerings for his great sacrifice (Vin.i.27). 
It was their custom to offer an annual sacrifice to Mahā-Brahmā in the hope of 
gaining reward a hundred thousand fold. On one occasion Sakka appears in person 
and goes with them to the Buddha so that they may not waste their energies in 
futile sacrifices (SA.i.269-70).</p>
<p>Several discourses were preached in the 
Anga country, among them being the <a href="sonadanda_sutta.htm" title="s/sonadanda_sutta.htm">Sonadanda Sutta</a> and the two Assapura Suttas 
(<a href="maha_assapura_s.htm" title="maha/maha_assapura_s.htm">Mahā</a>- and Cūla-). The
<a href="mahagovinda_s.htm" title="maha/mahagovinda_s.htm">Mahāgovinda Sutta</a> seems to indicate that once, in the 
past, Dhatarattha was king of Anga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country 
(Dial.ii.270 n.; see also The Rāmāyana i.8, 9, 17, 25). </p>
<p><a href="sona.htm" title="s/sona.htm">Sona Kolivisa</a>, before he entered the 
Order, was a squire (paddhagu) of Anga. Thag.v.632.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Anga.</b> King.-Chief lay supporter of Sumana Buddha (BuA.130); the Buddhavamsa mentions Varuna and Sarana as Sumana’s 
aggupatthākā and Udena as upatthāka. Bu.v.28.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Anga.</b>-A king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> on whose feet 
hair grew. He inquired of the brahmins the way to heaven, and was told to retire 
to the forest and tend the sacred fire. He went to Himavā with many cows and 
women and did as he was counselled. The milk and ghee left over from his 
sacrifices were thrown away, and from them arose many minor rivers, the Ganges 
itself, and even the sea. Later he became Indra’s companion. J.vi.203</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Anga.</b>-King of the Anga country, 
between whom and King Magadha there was constant war, with varying fortunes. In 
the end, Magadha, with the help of the Nāga king Campeyya, seized Anga and slew 
him. J.iv.453.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Anga.</b>-One of the Pacceka Buddhas 
mentioned in the list in the Apadana Commentary. ApA.i.107.</p>
<hr> <span lang="en-us">
<p><b>6. Angā</b>.-Chieftains of Anga, so called, 
  according to the Digha Nikāya Commentary (i.279), because of the beauty of 
  their limbs. Their name was customarily (rūlhi-vasena) used to denote their 
  country.</p>
