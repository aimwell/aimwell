<p>A goddess (devadhītā). She was once the watcher of a field 
of paddy rice in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, and when
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>, out of compassion, approached 
her, she took some of the parched rice and, with devout heart, poured it into 
his bowl. Almost immediately she was bitten by a snake, and was reborn after 
death in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>. Realizing that it was to Kassapa that she owed her good 
fortune, she decided to wait on him, sweep his cell, etc. As soon as Kassapa 
discovered this, he forbade her to come near him anymore. Lājā was much 
distressed, and the Buddha, noting her despair, sent a ray of light to console 
her. DhA.iii.6ff.</p>
