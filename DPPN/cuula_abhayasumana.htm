<p>A Thera who lived in the Mahāvihāra in 
the time of King Bhātiya. </p>
<p>He was an authority on the Vinaya, and a 
story is related in the Samantapāsādikā (Sp.ii.305f) of how he was consulted by 
a monk who having picked up in a crowd a robe that fell from the shoulders of 
another monk concealed it, but later wished to return it to the owner.</p>
