<p>1. Candabhāgā.-A river in India. It was 
the third river crossed by Mahā Kappina and his wife on their way from their own 
country, in the north-west, to Sāvatthi (ThagA.i.508). The river was one league 
deep and one wide (DhA.ii.120) and eighteen leagues in length, with a rapid 
current (DA.iii.877, 878). On its bank was a large banyan-tree where the Buddha 
awaited Kappina’s arrival (AA.i.177; SA.ii.179). The Milinda (p.114) mentions it 
as one of the ten important rivers flowing from the Himālaya. The name is 
evidently old, as it occurs in several ancient legends (E.g., Ap.i.75; 
ThagA.i.390; ThigA.9, etc.).</p>
<p>The Candabhāgā is generally identified 
with the Chenab (the Akesines of the Greeks). But see Ps. of the Brethren 255, 
n.1.</p>
<p>2. Candabhāgā.-A canal constructed by 
Parakkamabāhu I., flowing through the centre of the Lakkhuyyāna. Cv.lxxix.48.</p>
