<p>1. Tissa Sutta.-Relates the story of the 
Buddha’s nephew, Tissa (No.14), who visits the Buddha and complains that the 
monks abuse him (S.ii.282).</p>
<p>2. Tissa Sutta.-The story of Tissa 
(No.14) being taken to the Buddha because he complained of distaste for the 
monk’s life. By means of an allegory the Buddha teaches him how he can attain 
Nibbāna, and promises to help him to do so. S.iii.106f.</p>
<p>3. Tissa Sutta.-Moggallāna, hearing the 
Buddha report a conversation between two devatās at Gijjhakūta, visits the 
Brahmā Tissa in order to discover if the devas had knowledge of saupādisesa and 
anupādisesa.</p>
<p>Tissa tells him what he knows and 
Moggallāna describes his visit to the Buddha. The Buddha tells him that Tissa 
had omitted to mention the animittavihārī puggala, which he then proceeds to 
explain (A.iv.77f; cp. A.iii.332f).</p>
