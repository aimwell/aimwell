<p>A locality in Himavā. When Alavaka threatened the Buddha 
he stood with his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsa (SNA.i.223). 
Manosilātala was near Anotatta, and those who bathed in the lake dried and robed 
themselves there (E.g., J.i.232; iii.379). It was also a resort of lions 
(J.ii.65) and was sixty leagues in extent (J.ii.92, 219). Above it was the 
Kañcanaguhā (J.v.392) and below it the Kālapabbata. 
J.vi.265.</p>
