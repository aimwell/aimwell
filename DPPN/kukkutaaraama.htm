<p>1. Kukkutārāma.-A monastery in Kosambī, 
built by the setthi Kukkuta (q.v.). DA.i.318, etc.</p>
<p>2. Kukkutārāma.-A pleasaunce in 
Pātaliputta. It was evidently the residence of monks from very early times, 
probably, for some time, of the Buddha himself. The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.300) 
mentions the names of several theras who lived there: Nilavāsi, Sānavāsi, Gopaka, 
Bhagu, Phalikasandana. The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.15f; 171f) records several 
discussions which took place there between Ānanda and Bhadda. It may have been a 
favourite resort of Ānanda, for we find the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara 
going there to enquire as to his whereabouts (A.v.342; M.i.349). It was also 
(probably at a later date) the residence of Nārada who converted King Munda (A.iii.57f), 
and afterwards of Sonaka, the upajjhāya of Siggava, and of Candavajji, the 
teacher Mogaliputta-Tissa (Mhv.v.122). Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; 
AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutarāma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further 
particulars. Here there is probably some confusion with the ārāma of the same 
name at Kosambī. Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op. cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkutārāma 
was to the southeast of the old city of Pātaliputta and was built by Asoka when 
he first became a convert to the Buddha’s religion. “It was a sort of 
first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction.” Only the foundation of the 
building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang’s visit. It is probable that this 
account refers to the Asokārāma which Asoka built as the first of his Buddhist 
structures, and that the Asokārāma was constructed on the site of the old 
Kukkutārāma. It is significant that the Pāli books, in recording Asoka’s doings, 
make no mention of a Kukkutārāma existing in his time, though the Sanskrit 
texts, the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.381f, 430ff; see also Smith: Asoka, 183, 193f), 
for instance, makes frequent reference to it. If the conjecture made above, 
namely that the Asokārāma replaced the Kukkutārāma, be correct, it may have been 
that the place was known by both names in Asoka’s time.</p>
