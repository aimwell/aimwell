<hr>
<p>1. Ghatīkāra Sutta.-Preached during a 
tour in Kosala. The Buddha turned off the main road and, when be came to the 
spot which had once been Vehalinga, he smiled. Being asked by Ānanda the reason 
for his smile, the Buddha related to him and to the monks the story of Ghatīkāra, 
the potter of Vehalinga, as given above (M.ii.45ff). It is said (MA.ii.717) that 
the Buddha wished to make known to the monks the great piety of Ghatīkāra. The 
sutta was repeated at a shrine near Todeyya, which was being worshipped by the 
people without their knowing its significance. The Buddha related the sutta and 
explained that the shrine was the thūpa of Kassapa Buddha. DhA.iii.251.</p>
<p>2. Ghatīkāra Sutta.-Relates the visit of 
Ghatīkāra Mahā Brahmā to the Buddha at Jetavana and the ensuing conversation. 
S.i.35f, 60.</p>
