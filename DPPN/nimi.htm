<h4>1. Nimi</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta born as king of 
<a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a>. See <a href="nimi_jat_541.htm">Nimi Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nimi</h4>
<p>A Pacceka Buddha. He was king, of 
<a href="mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a>. One day he saw 
a hawk, which was flying with some meat, attacked by vultures. The hawk dropped the meat, which was then taken up by another bird and he, in his turn, was attacked. This process continuing for some time, the king realized that possessions bring sorrow and suffering. He thereupon renounced his sixteen 
thousand women, and reflecting on his renunciation, became a Pacceka Buddha, and 
joined three others, who had also become Pacceka Buddhas: Karandu, Naggaji and 
Dummukha. J.iii.378f.</p>
