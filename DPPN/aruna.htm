<p>1. Aruna.-A khattiya, father of Sikhī 
Buddha and husband of Pabhāvatī (Bu.xxi.15; J.i.41; AA.i.436). Aruna’s chief 
queen became the Therī Abhayā in the present age (ThigA.41). Another of his 
wives became, in her last life, the Therī Somā (ThigA.66), who is perhaps to be 
identified with Uppaladāyikā of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.601f). In the Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.i.155) he is called Arunavā.</p>
<p>2. Aruna.-The Assaka king of Potali in 
the Assaka country. (In the main story the king’s name is given as Assaka, but 
the scholiast says his real name was Aruna). The Kālinga king of that time, 
longing for a fight, but finding no one willing to accept his challenge, at last 
devised a plan. He sent his four beautiful daughters, in a covered carriage and 
with an armed escort to the various cities in the neighbourhood, proclaiming 
that any king, who took them as wives, would have to fight their father. No one 
was found willing to take the risk till they came to Potali in the Assaka 
country. Even the Assaka king at first merely sent them a present by way of 
courtesy, but his minister, Nandisena, fertile in expedients, urged the king to 
marry them, saying that he himself would undertake to face the consequences. The 
Kālinga king at once set out with his army. On his way to Potali, he came across 
the Bodhisatta, who was leading the ascetic life and, without revealing his 
identity, consulted him regarding his chances of success in the fight. The 
Bodhisatta promised that he would see Sakka about it the next day and, having 
done so, informed the king that the Kālinga forces would win. Nandisena heard of 
this prophecy but, nothing daunted, he gathered together the Assaka forces and 
all their allies; then, by a well-planned manoeuvre, he managed to have the 
tutelary deity of Kālinga (who was fighting for the Kālinga king) killed by 
Assaka. Thereupon the Kālinga king was routed and fled. The Bodhisatta, finding 
that his prophecy had turned out false, sought Sakka in his distress; Sakka 
consoled him thus: “Hast thou never heard that even the gods favour the bold 
hero of intrepid resolve, who never yields?”</p>
<p>Later, at the suggestion of Nandisena, 
the Assaka king demanded of Kālinga’s ruler dowry for his four daughters, and 
the Kālinga king acceded to his request. The story is told in the Kālinga Jātaka 
(J.iii.3ff.).</p>
<p>3. Aruna.-The pleasaunce near Anupama 
where the Buddha Vessabhu first preached to his chief disciples, Sona and Uttara. 
Bu.xxii.22, BuA.205.</p>
<p>4. Aruna.-The name of the lotus that 
grows in the Nāga world. It was one of Uppalavannā’s wishes to have a body of 
the colour of the Aruna-lotus. Ap.ii.554(v.39).</p>
<p>5. Aruna.-A class of devas present at 
the preaching of the Mahā-Samaya Sutta. They were of diverse hue, of wondrous 
gifts, mighty powers, comely and with splendid following. D.ii.260.</p>
