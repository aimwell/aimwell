  <h2>Satapatta Jātaka (No. 279)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A landowner of Benares had given one thousand to some one 
and had died before recovering it. His wife, lying on her deathbed, asked her 
son to get it for her while she was yet alive. He went and recovered the money; 
but while he was away his mother died, and, because of her great love for him, 
was born as a jackal. She tried to prevent him from entering a wood infested 
with robbers, headed by the Bodhisatta, but the man did not understand what the 
jackal said and kept on driving her away. A crane, flying overhead, cried out to 
the robbers, announcing the lad’s approach, but he, taking it to be a bird of 
good omen, saluted it. The Bodhisatta heard both sounds, and when his band 
captured the man, he told him that he did not know how to distinguish between 
friend and foe and sent him off with a warning.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to two of the Chabbaggiyā, 
Pandu and Lohitaka. They questioned the Buddha’s teachings on certain points and 
encouraged others to do the same, the result being quarrel and strife. The 
Buddha sent for them and told them that this was a foolish policy; they did not 
know what was good for them. J.ii.387 90.</p>
