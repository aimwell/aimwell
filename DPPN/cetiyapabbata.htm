<p>Also called Cetiyagiri. The later name 
of the Missaka mountain given on account of its many shrines. Devānampiyatissa 
built a vihāra there — the second vihāra in Ceylon — for Mahinda and those 
ordained under him (Mhv.xvi.12-17). The relics, obtained by Sumanasāmanera from 
Asoka and from Sakka, were deposited there until they were needed. According to 
the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxii.23ff) this fact was the occasion for the name. One of 
the eight saplings of the Sacred Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted in the 
drama on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xix.62). Mahinda spent the last years of his life on 
Cetiyagiri and died there, and there his relics were enshrined (Mhv.xx.32, 45). 
Near the mountain was the village of Dvāramandala (Mhv.xxiii.23). Kutakannatissa 
built an uposatha-hall on the mountain and planted a Bodhi-tree, while 
Bhāti-kābhaya supplied food daily to one thousand monks dwelling there 
(Mhv.xxxiv.30f, 64), and Lañjakatissa had the vihāra paved at a cost of one 
hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.25). Mahādāthikamahānāga made four gateways and a 
road round the mountain, and held the Giribhandapūjā with great pomp and 
ceremony; it is said that in order that the people might approach the mountain 
with clean feet he spread carpets right up to it from the Kadamba River 
(Mhv.xxxiv.75ff). Kanirajānutissa had sixty monks of Cetiyapabbata put to death 
as traitors by flinging them into the cave called Kanira (Mhv.xxxv.11). Vasabha 
provided four thousand lamps to be lighted on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xxxv.80), while 
Jetthatissa gave to the vihāra the income derived from the Kālamattika Tank. 
(Mhv.xxxvi.130; see also Dpv.xv.69; xvii.90; xix.13, and Sp.i.82ff).</p>
<p>In the time of Kakusandha, Cetiyagiri 
was known as Devakūta, in that of Konāgamana as Suvannakūta, and in that of 
Kassapa as Subhakūta (Sp.i.86f). The Dhammarucikas once occupied the 
Ambatthalavihāra on Cetiyapabbata, it having been given to them by Dhātusena 
(Cv.xxxviii.75). Aggabodhi supplied a permanent supply of water for the 
bathing-tank called Nāgasondi, on the top of Cetiyagiri (Cv.xlii.28; see Cv. 
Trs.i.68, n.8), while Aggabodhi III. gave to the vihāra the village of 
Ambillapadara (Cv.xliv.122). Aggabodhi V. restored the ruined buildings of 
Cetiyapabbata at a cost of one hundred and twenty thousand pieces (Cv.xlviii.7), 
while the queen of Udaya I, built there the Kanthakacetiya, and her husband 
decorated the mountain with brightly coloured flags and streamers (Cv.xlix.23, 
27). Sena I, gave to the monastery the income from the Kānavāpi (Cv.l.72), and 
Sena II. Provided a hospital for the use of the monks there (Cv.li.73). Kassapa 
VI. built the Hadayunha Parivena and gifted it to the Dhammarucikas (Cv.lii.18). 
Parakkamabāhu I restored all the old buildings which had been destroyed and 
built sixty-four thūpas (Cv.lxxviii.108).</p>
<p>The Commentaries relate several 
anecdotes connected with Cetiyapabbata. Maliyadeva Thera recited there the 
Chachakka Sutta, and sixty listening bhikkhus became arahants (MA.ii.1064). 
Lomasanāga Theca lived in the Padhānaghara in the Piyanguguhā there and overcame 
the cold he felt by meditating on the Lokantarikaniraya (MA.i.65). 
Cetiyapabbata was the residence of Kālabuddharakkhita, and King Saddhātissa 
spent some time there (MA.i.469f. See also Vsm.20, 64; DhSA.194, 200; AA.i.44). 
At the time that Fa Hsien came to Ceylon there were two thousand monks in 
Cetiyagiri, including a monk of great fame, called Dharmagupta (Giles: p.72).</p>
