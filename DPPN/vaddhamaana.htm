<p><b>1. Vaddhamāna Thera.</b> An arahant. He belonged to a 
Licchavi rājā’s family in Vesāli and was a devoted follower of the Buddha, 
delighting in waiting upon him and in making gifts to the monks. Later, because 
of an offence he had committed, the Buddha passed on him the sentence of 
pattanikkujjana. He was much grieved and begged the forgiveness of the Sangha, 
and, because of his agitation, he renounced the world and joined the Order. But 
he was given up to sloth and torpor, till the Buddha admonished him in a verse*. 
He then put forth effort and became an arahant.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* This verse is found in the Thag.vs.40; elsewhere 
  (Thag.vs.1162) this verse is ascribed to Moggallāna as having been spoken by 
  him to a monk named Tissa and again repeated (vs. 1163) by him to Vaddhamāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is probably to be identified with Vaddha (1), though no 
mention is made of Vaddha having entered the Order.</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he had been a householder and 
had given the Buddha beautiful mango fruits. ThagA.i.106.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vaddhamāna. </b>The capital of Ceylon (Varadīpa) in 
the time of Konāgamana Buddha. Its king was Samiddha. Mhv.xv.92; Dpv.xv.48; 
xvii.6; Sp.i.86.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vaddhamāna.</b> A city (nagara) in Mahāgāma, over 
which Gāmani-Abhaya (afterwards Dutthagāmani) was appointed chief soon after his 
birth (MT. 443).</p>
<p>A story is related (AA.ii.522) of a hunter of Vaddhamāna 
who, in the name of his dead kinsman, gave alms to a wicked monk. Three times he 
did this, till the spirit of the peta cried out against it. He then gave alms to 
a good monk. The peta benefited by his gift.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vaddhamāna.</b> The name of a Bodhi tree in Ceylon. 
Attached to it was a temple, restored by Aggabodhi IV. (Cv.xlviii.5) and again 
by Udaya V. (Cv.xlix.15).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vaddhamāna.</b> A palace to be occupied by the 
future Buddha Meteyya. Anāgat. vs.46.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vaddhamāna.</b> A district in 
Ceylon, given by King Saddhātissa to his minister, Saddhātissa (2). 
Ras.ii.10.</p>
