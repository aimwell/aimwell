  <h2>Uttarakuru</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A country often mentioned in the Nikāyas 
and in later literature as a mythical region. A detailed description of it is 
given in the <a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Ātānātiya Sutta</a>. (D.iii.199ff; here Uttarakuru is spoken of as a 
city, pura; see also Uttarakuru in Hopkins: Epic Mythology, especially p.186). 
The men who live there own no property nor have they wives of their own; they do 
not have to work for their living. The corn ripens by itself and sweet-scented 
rice is found boiling on hot oven-stoves. The inhabitants go about riding on 
cows, on men and women, on maids and youths. Their king rides on an elephant, on 
a horse, on celestial cars and in state palanquins. Their cities are built in 
the air, and among those mentioned are Ātānātā, Kusinātā, Nātapuriyā, 
Parakusinātā, Kapīvanta, Janogha, Navanavatiya, Ambara-Ambaravatiya and 
<a href="aalakamandaa.htm" title="aa/aalakamandaa.htm">Ālakamandā</a>, the last being the chief city.</p>
<p>The king of Uttarakuru is <a href="kuvera.htm" title="ku/kuvera.htm">Kuvera</a>, also 
called Vessavana, because the name of his citadel (? rājadhāni) is Visāna. His 
proclamations are made known by Tatolā, Tattalā, Tatotalā, Ojasi, Tejasi, 
Tetojasi, Sūra, Rāja, Arittha and Nemi. Mention is also made of a lake named 
Dharanī and a hall named Bhagalavati where the Yakkhas, as the inhabitants of 
Uttarakuru are called, hold their assemblies.</p>
<p>The country is always spoken of as being 
to the north of Jambudīpa. It is eight thousand leagues in extent and is 
surrounded by the sea (DA.ii.623; BuA.113). Sometimes it is spoken of (E.g., 
A.i.227; v.59; SnA.ii.443) as one of the four Mahādīpā — the others being 
<a href="aparagoyaana.htm" title="ay/aparagoyaana.htm">Aparagoyāna</a>, 
<a href="pubbavideha.htm" title="pu/pubbavideha.htm">Pubbavideha</a> and 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a> — each being surrounded by five hundred 
minor islands. These four make up a <a href="cakkavaala.htm" title="c/cakkavaala.htm">Cakkavāla</a>, with Mount Meru in their midst, a 
flat-world system. A cakkavattī’s rule extends over all these four continents 
(D.ii.173; DA.ii.623) and his chief queen comes either from the race of King 
Madda or from Uttarakuru; in the latter case she appears before him of her own 
accord, urged on by her good fortune (DA.ii.626; KhA.173).</p>
<p>The trees in Uttarakuru bear perpetual 
fruit and foliage, and it also possesses a Kapparukkha which lasts for a whole 
kappa (A.i.264; MA.ii.948). There are no houses in Uttarakuru, the inhabitants 
sleep on the earth and are called, therefore, bhūmisayā (ThagA.ii.187-8).</p>
<p>The men of Uttarakuru surpass even the 
gods of <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> in four things:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>they have no greed (amamā) (the people of 
Uttarakuru are acchandikā, VibhA.461), </li>
  <li>no private property (apariggahā), </li>
  <li>they 
have a definite term of life (niyatāyukā) (one thousand years, after which they 
are born in heaven, says <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a>, AA.ii.806) 
  </li>
  <li>and they possess great elegance 
(visesabhuno). </li>
</ul>
<p>They are, however, inferior to the men of Jambudīpa in courage, mindfulness 
and in the religious life (A.iv.396; Kvu.99).</p>
<p>Several instances are given of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> having gone to Uttarakuru for alms. Having obtained his food there, he 
would go to the <a href="anotatta.htm" title="ay/anotatta.htm">Anotatta</a> lake, bathe in its waters and, after the meal, spend 
the afternoon on its banks (See, e.g., Vin.i.27-8; DhsA.16; DhA.iii.222). The 
power of going to Uttarakuru for alms is not restricted to the Buddha; 
<a href="pacceka_buddha.htm" title="pa/pacceka_buddha.htm">Pacceka 
Buddhas</a> and various ascetics are mentioned as having visited Uttarakuru on their 
begging rounds (See, e.g., J.v.316; vi.100; MA.i.340; SnA.ii.420). It is 
considered a mark of great iddhi-power to be able to do this (E.g., Rohita, 
SA.i.93; also Mil.84).</p>
<p>Jotika’s wife was a woman of Uttarakuru; 
she was brought to <a href="jotika.htm" title="j/jotika.htm">Jotika</a> by the gods. She brought with her a single pint pot of 
rice and three crystals. The rice-pot was never exhausted; whenever a meal was 
desired, the rice was put in a boiler and the boiler set over the crystals; the 
heat of the crystals went out as soon as the rice was cooked. The same thing 
happened with curries (DhA.iv.209ff). Food never ran short in Uttarakuru; once 
when there was a famine in <a href="veranjaa.htm" title="vy/veranjaa.htm">Verañjā</a> and the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> and his monks were finding it 
difficult to get alms, we find <a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> suggesting that they should go to Uttarakuru for alms (Vin.iii.7). The clothes worn by the inhabitants resembled 
divine robes (See, e.g., PvA.76).</p>
<p>It was natural for the men of Uttarakuru 
not to transgress virtue, they had pakati-sīla (Vsm.i.15).</p>
<p>Uttarakuru is probably identical with 
the Kuru country mentioned in the Rg-Veda (See Vedic Index).</p>
