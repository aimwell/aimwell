  <h2>Mahāsīhanāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at the Mahāvana in Vesāli. Sāriputta tells the 
Buddha that Sunakkhatta, who had recently left the Order, went about saying that 
there was nothing marvellous about the Buddha’s knowledge and insight and that 
his teachings did not lead to the end of Ill. The Buddha says that Sunakkhatta 
is a man of wrath and folly and incapable of appreciating the good either of the 
Tathāgata or of his teachings. He then issues his challenge to the effect that 
no one can deny to the Tathāgata the possession of ten powers, (balā) — 
which are enumerated — and the four confidences 
(vesārajjā). The Tathāgata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear; 
he knows the various classifications of beings, the birth of beings, the way to 
Nibbāna; he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await 
different beings. He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his 
practice of asceticism, in loathliness, in scrupulosity, in solitude. No one has 
surpassed him in the practice of these things. He has discovered, by 
experimentation, the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity 
comes by way of food, or offering, or ritual. Though eighty years old and his 
body broken down, yet his powers of mind are at their prime; even if he must be 
carried on a litter, yet will his mind retain its powers (M.i.68 83).</p>
<p>Nāgasamāla, who is by, asks the Buddha for a title for the 
discourse, and the Buddha gives it the name of Lomahamsapariyāya. cp. Lomahamsa 
Jātaka.</p>
