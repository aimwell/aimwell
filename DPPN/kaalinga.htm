<p><b>1. Kālinga, Kalinga.</b>-An inhabitant of Ñātika.
While staying in Ñātika, at the <a href="ginjakaavasatha.htm" title="g/ginjakaavasatha.htm">Giñjakāvasatha</a>, the Buddha 
tells Ānanda that Kālinga was reborn after death in the Suddhavāsā, and that 
there he would attain to nibbāna. D.ii.92; S.v.358f</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Kālinga.</b>-A country: the Kālingarattha. 
It is one of the seven political divisions mentioned in the time of the mythical 
king <a href="renu.htm" title="r/renu.htm">Renu</a> and is given first in the list, its capital being 
<a href="dantapura.htm" title="d/dantapura.htm">Dantapura</a> and its 
king Sattabhū. (D.ii.235f; see also Mtu.iii.208; the Mtu. also mentions a king 
Uggata of Dantapura, iii.364f).  </p>
<p>It is not, however, included in the list of 
sixteen Janapadas appearing in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.213, etc.), but is 
found in the extended list of the Niddesa (CNid.ii.37). A later tradition 
(Bu.xviii.6) states that after the Buddha’s death, a Tooth was taken from among 
his relics and placed at Kālinga, where it was worshipped. From Kālinga the 
Tooth was brought to Ceylon, in the time of King Sirimeghavanna, by Hemamālā, 
daughter of Guhasīva, king of Kālinga, and her husband Dantakumāra, a prince of 
the Ujjeni royal family. In Ceylon the Tooth became the “Palladium” of the 
Sinhalese kings. (Cv.xxxvii.92; see also Cv.Trs.i.7, n.4; the Dāthādhātuvamsa 
gives details, J.P.T.S.1884, pp.108ff).</p>
<p>The Jātakas contain various references 
to Kālinga. There was once a great drought in Dantapura, and the king, acting on 
the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to the king of Kuru to beg the loan 
of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, credited with the power of producing rain. 
On this occasion, however, the elephant failed and the Kālinga king, hearing of 
the virtues practised by the king and people of Dantapura, offered them himself, 
upon which rain fell. See the <a href="kurudhamma_jat_276.htm" title="ku/kurudhamma_jat_276.htm">Kurudhamma Jātaka</a>, J.ii.367ff, also DhA.iv.88f. A 
similar story is related in the <a href="vessantara.htm" title="vy/vessantara.htm">Vessantara Jātaka</a>, vi.487, where the Kālinga 
brahmins ask for and obtain Vessantara’s white elephant that he may stay the 
drought in Kālinga.</p>
<p>Another king of Kālinga was a 
contemporary of <a href="aruna.htm" title="ay/aruna.htm">Aruna</a>, the 
<a href="assaka.htm" title="ay/assaka.htm">Assaka</a> king of <a href="potali.htm" title="pu/potali.htm">Potali</a>. The Kālinga king, in his 
eagerness for a fight, picked a quarrel with Aruna, but was worsted in battle, 
and had to surrender his four daughters with their dowries to Aruna (J.iii.3f).</p>
<p>The <a href="kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm" title="ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm">Kālingabodhi Jātaka</a> relates 
the story of another ruler of Kālinga while, according to the 
<a href="sarabhanga_jat_522.htm" title="sa/sarabhanga_jat_522.htm">Sarabhanga Jātaka</a>, a certain king of Kālinga (J.v.135f) went with two other kings, 
<a href="atthaka.htm" title="ay/atthaka.htm">Atthaka</a> 
and <a href="bhiimaratha.htm" title="b/bhiimaratha.htm">Bhīmaratta</a>, to ask Sarabhanga questions referring to the fate of 
<a href="dandakii.htm" title="d/dandakii.htm">Dandakī</a>. 
There they heard the sage preach, and all three kings became ascetics. Another 
king of Kālinga was <a href="naalikira.htm" title="n/naalikira.htm">Nālikīra</a>, who, having ill-treated a holy man, was 
swallowed up in the Sunakha-niraya, while his country was laid waste by the gods 
and turned into a wilderness (Kālingārañña). The Kālinga-arañña is referred to 
in the Upāli Sutta (M.i.378); the story is related in J.v.144 and, in greater 
detail, in MA.ii.602ff. In the <a href="kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm" title="ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408.htm">Kumbhakāra Jātaka</a> (J.iii.376) the Kālinga king’s 
name is Karandu.</p>
<p>From early times there seems to have 
been political intercourse between the peoples of Kālinga and 
<a href="vanga.htm" title="va/vanga.htm">Vanga</a>; <a href="susiimaa.htm" title="s/susiimaa.htm">Susīmā</a>, 
grandmother of <a href="vijaya.htm" title="vy/vijaya.htm">Vijaya</a>, founder of the Sinhalese race, was a Kālinga princess, 
married to the king of Vanga (Mhv.vi.1; Dpv.ix.2ff). Friendly relations between 
Ceylon and Kālinga were evidently of long standing, for we find in the reign of 
Aggabodhi II. (601-11 A.C.) the king of Kālinga, together with his queen and his 
minister, coming over to Ceylon intent on leading the life of a recluse and 
joining the Order under Jotipāla. Aggabodhi and his queen treated them with 
great honour (Cv.xlii.44ff). Later, the queen consort of Mahinda IV. came from 
Kālinga and Vijayabāhu I. married a Kālinga princess, Tilokasundarī (Cv.lix.30). 
We are told that scions of the Kālinga dynasty had many times attained to the 
sovereignty of Ceylon and that there were many ties of relationship between the 
royal families of the two countries (Cv.lxiii.7, 12f). But it was Māgha, an 
offspring of the Kālinga kings, who did incomparable damage to Ceylon and to its 
religion and literature (Cv.lxxx.58ff).</p>
<p>According to the inscriptions, Asoka, in 
the thirteenth year of his reign, conquered Kālinga and this was the 
turning-point in his career, causing him to abhor war (Mookerji: Asoka, pp.16, 
37, 214). Among the retinue sent by him to accompany the branch of the Sacred 
Bodhi Tree on its journey to Ceylon, were eight families of Kālinga (Sp.i.96).</p>
<p>Asoka’s brother Tissa, later known as 
Ekavihāriya, spent his retirement in the Kālinga country with his instructor 
Dhammarakkhita, and there Asoka built for him the Bhojakagiri-vihāra 
(ThagA.i.506).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="vessantara_jat_547.htm" title="vy/vessantara_jat_547.htm">Vessantara Jātaka</a> 
(J.vi.521), the brahmin village Dunnivittha, residence of 
<a href="juujaka.htm" title="j/juujaka.htm">Jūjaka</a>, was in Kālinga.</p>
<p>Kālinga is generally identified with the 
modern Orissa. (CAGI.590ff; Law: Early Geography, 64; see also Bhandarkar: Anct. 
Hist. of Deccan, p.12).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Kālinga.</b>-Various kings of Kālinga are 
mentioned either as Kālingarājā or simply as Kālinga. For these see Kālinga (2). 
We also hear of Culla Kālinga and Mahā Kālinga. Culla Kālinga is sometimes 
called Kālinga-kumāra (J.iv.230).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Kālinga.</b>-Son of Culla-Kālinga. See 
the <a href="kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm" title="ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm">Kālingabodhi Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Kālinga.</b>-A Damila chief, ally of 
Kulasekhara (Cv.lxxvi.174, 214, 217, 222). He was a brother of the wife of 
Tondamāna. Cv.lxxvii.40.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Kālinga.</b>-Another Damila chief, 
conquered by Bhuvenakabāhu I. Cv.xc.32.</p>
