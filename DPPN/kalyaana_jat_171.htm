  <h2>Kalyāna-dhamma Jātaka (No.171)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant 
in Benares. One day, when he had gone to pay his respects to the king, his 
mother-in-law visited his wife. The former was deaf, and on asking her daughter 
if they were happy, and receiving the reply that the husband was a very good 
man, like a hermit, she heard only the word “hermit,” and she raised a great 
uproar thinking that her son-in-law had turned hermit. The news spread like 
wildfire, and as the merchant was on his way home he was told by someone that 
all the members of his household were weeping because he had become a hermit. 
Thinking that auspicious words should not be trifled with, the merchant went to 
the king, took his leave, and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
merchant of Sāvatthi to whom the same thing happened when he went to pay his 
respects to the Buddha (J.ii.63-5). </p>
<p>The story is also given in the 
Jātakamālā, where it is called the Sresthi Jātaka (No.20).</p>
