  <h2>Rāmañña</h2>

</ul>
<p>The Pāli name for Burma, referring particularly to the maritime provinces.
</p>
<p>After the conversion of Rāmañña to Buddhism, there was a constant intercourse 
between that country and Ceylon (So says also Cv.lxxvi.10f). Vijayabāhu I. sent 
an embassy to Anuruddha, king of Rāmañña, and obtained from him learned and 
pious monks to re establish the Sangha in Ceylon (Cv.lxviii.8; lx.5ff.; but see 
Cv. Trs.i.n.4). </p>
<p>The kings of Rāmañña seem to have been in the habit of giving a special 
maintenance to Singhalese envoys sent to their country. The chief trade between 
the two countries was in elephants; the king of Rāmañña made a gift of an 
elephant to every vessel bringing gifts from foreign lands. In the time of 
Parakkamabāhu I., relations were strained between the two countries as a result 
of insults paid by the king of Rāmañña, and Parakkamabāhu sent a punitive 
expedition under the Damilādhikārin, Ādicca. This expedition started from 
Pallavanka, and some of the forces landed at Kusumī in Rāmañña and the others at 
Papphālama. It is said that in a battle fought at Ukkama, the Singhalese forces 
killed the Rāmañña king. Thereafter, through the intervention of the monks, 
peace was restored between the two countries, and the Ramanas, as the people of 
Rāmañña were called, sent a yearly tribute to the king of Ceylon. For details of 
this expedition see Cv.lxxvi.10ff.; also Cv. Trs.ii.69, n.3.</p>
