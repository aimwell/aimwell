<p><b>1. Dhammadinnā</b>.-One of the two chief 
women disciples of <a href="piyadassii.htm" title="pu/piyadassii.htm">Piyadassī</a> Buddha. Bu.xiv.21; J.i.39.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dhammadinnā</b>.-One of the chief 
supporters, among lay women, of <a href="piyadassii.htm" title="pu/piyadassii.htm">Piyadassī</a> Buddha. Bu.xiv.22.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Dhammadinnā.</b>-An eminent Therī, ranked 
foremost among nuns who possessed the gift of preaching (A.i.25). She was the 
wife of <a href="visaakha.htm" title="vy/visaakha.htm">Visākha</a> of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, and when he, having heard the Buddha preach, became 
an anāgāmī, she left the world with the consent of her husband who sent her to 
the nunnery in a golden palanquin (MA.i.515 says this was provided by 
Bimbisāra). Dwelling in solitude, she soon attained arahantship with the four patisambhidā. (See Thig.v.12 for a stanza uttered by her). She later returned to 
Rājagaha to worship the Buddha, and there Visākha asked her questions on the 
Dhamma, which she answered “as easily as one might cut a lows-stalk with a 
knife.” The questions and answers are given in the Cūla Vedalla Sutta 
(M.i.299ff). Visākha reported this interview to the Buddha, who praised her 
great wisdom and commended her eloquence.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she 
was a servant, and one day saw the Buddha’s disciple, Sujāta, begging alms and 
gave him a curry (ThigA. p.15 says Sujāta had just risen from samādhi). Her 
master, seeing this, made her his daughter-in-law. Later, while on a visit to 
the vihāra, she saw a nun declared to be chief of preachers and wished for 
similar eminence.</p>
<p>In the time of Phussa Buddha she 
obtained merit by giving to the Buddha’s half-brother double the gift prescribed 
by her husband. (Details of this are given in PvA., p.21).</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was 
born as Sudhammā, the sixth of the seven daughters of Kiki, king of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>; for 
twenty thousand years she lived in celibacy. (Her story is given in ThigA.15ff; 
Ap.ii.567f; AA.i.196f; MA.i.515ff; DhA.iv.229ff).</p>
<p>Dhammadinnā was the teacher of Sukhā 
(ThigA.58).</p>
