<p>1. Ujjaya, Ujjāya.-A Pacceka Buddha, 
mentioned in the list in the Isigili Sutta. M.iii.70.</p>
<p>2. Ujjaya.-A thera. He was the son of a 
Sotthiya-brahmin of Rājagaha, and became proficient in the three Vedas. 
Dissatisfied with the teaching of the Vedas, he went to the Buddha and heard him 
preach at Veluvana. Later he entered the Order and retired into the forest, 
having learnt a subject for meditation. Soon after he became an arahant. In a 
past life he had offered a kanikāra-flower to the Buddha. Thirty-five kappas ago 
he was a king named Arunabala (Thag.v.67; ThagA.i.118f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Kanikārapupphiya of the Apadāna (Ap.i.203).</p>
<p>3. Ujjaya.-A brahmin. He once went to 
the Buddha and asked him if he thought well of sacrifices. The Buddha replied 
that he was opposed to sacrifices which involved the slaughter of animals, but 
sacrifices not necessitating butchery, such as, for instance, a long-established 
charity, an oblation for the welfare of the family, had his approval (A.ii.42).</p>
<p>The same Nikāya (A.iv.285f) records 
another visit of Ujjaya wherein he tells the Buddha that he wishes to observe a 
period of retreat (upavāsa), and asks for a teaching which will bring welfare 
both in this world and in the next. See below Ujjaya Sutta 2.</p>
