<p>The thirteenth division of the Khuddaka 
Nikāya. It is a Buddhist Vitae Sanctorum and contains 547 biographies of monks 
and forty biographies of nuns, all mentioned as having lived in the time of the 
Buddha. The Cy. gives details of eleven more theras not found in the text: Yasa, 
Nadīkassapa, Gayākassapa, Kimbila, Vajjiputta, Uttara, Apara-Uttara, Bhaddaji, 
Sivika, Upavāna and Ralthapāla. </p>
<p>In addition to these, there are two 
introductory chapters, the Buddhā-padāna and the Paccekabuddhā-padāna, dealing 
with the Buddha and the Pacceka Buddhas respectively. It is worth noting that 
the Buddhā-padāna contains no account of the Buddha’s life, either as Gotama or 
earlier, as Bodhisatta (see, however, Pubbakammapiloti). Nor does the 
Paccekabuddhā-padāna contain any life-histories. The stanzas are what might be 
more appropriately described as udāna, and appear in the Khaggavisāna Sutta of 
the Sutta Nipāta. Cp. the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.1ff), where the word Apadāna is 
used as meaning the legend or life-story of a Buddha or a Great One — in this 
case the seven Buddhas. Or does Mahāpadāna mean the Great Story, i.e. the story 
of the Dhamma and its bearers and promulgation: cp. the title of the Mahāvastu 
(Dial.ii.3).</p>
<p>Most of the stories are found in the 
Paramatthadīpanī, the Commentary to the Thera- and Therīgāthā, extracted from 
the Apadāna with the introductory words, “tena vuttam Apadāne.” But in numerous 
instances the names under which the verses appear in the Paramatthadīpanī differ 
from those subjoined to the verses in the Apadāna. In several cases it is a 
matter of the Commentary giving a name while the Apadāna gives only a title. 
E.g., Usabha Thera (ThagA.i.320), called Kosumbaphaliya (Ap.ii.449); and 
Isidinna (ThagA.i.312), called (Ap.ii.415) Sumanavījaniya. </p>
<p>Sometimes the stories are duplicated in 
the Apadāna itself, the same story occurring in two places with a very slight 
alteration in words, even the name of the person spoken of being the same. Most 
often no reason can be assigned for this, except, perhaps, careless editing. 
E.g., Annasamsāvaka i Ap.i.78 and again i.261; see also the Introduction to the 
P.T.S. Edition.</p>
<p>The Apadāna is regarded as one of the 
very latest books in the Canon, one reason for this view being that while later 
books like the Buddhavamsa mention only twenty-four Buddhas previous to Gotama, 
the Apadāna contains the names of thirty-five. It is very probable that the 
different legends in the collection are of different dates. On these and other 
matters connected with the Apadāna, see Rhys Davids article in ERE. and Muller’s 
Les Apadānas du Sud (Congress of Orientalists, Leyden, 1895).</p>
<p>According to the Sumangala Vilāsinī 
(i.15. See also Przyluski: La Legende de l'Empereur Acoka, pp. viii f., 214), 
the Dīghabhānakas, who included the Khuddaka Nikāya in the Abhidhammapitaka, did 
not recognise the Apadāna. The Majjhimabhānakas included it in the Khuddaka 
Nikāya, which they regarded as belonging to the Suttapitaka. There is a 
Commentary to the Apadāna called the Visuddhajanavilāsinī.</p>
<p>According to Gv. (p. 69) the Commentary 
on the Apadāna was written by Buddhaghosa at the request of five monks.</p>
