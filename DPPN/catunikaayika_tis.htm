<p>A monk of Ceylon. He lived in the Kolita-vihāra, 
while his elder brother, Dattābhaya, lived in the Potaliya-vihāra. Once Tissa 
fell ill and, sending for his brother, asked for a brief formula for meditation. 
Dattābhaya recommended meditation on kabalinkāhāra and Tissa soon became an 
arahant (AA.i.243). His teacher was Mahātipitakatthera. Sp.iii.695.</p>
