<p>A brahmin village in <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, not far from 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. It 
was the township of the <a href="upatissa.htm" title="u/upatissa.htm">Upatissas</a> (hence also called Upatissagāma), and it was 
there that <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and other members of his family were born (*1). </p>
<p>It was also the birthplace of 
<a href="mahagavaccha_th.htm" title="maha/mahagavaccha_th.htm">Mahā Gavaccha</a> (ThagA.i.57). 
Sāriputta seems to have continued to reside there from time to time, even after 
he joined the Order (*2), and when his death drew near, he went back to 
Nālakagāma and, having made his mother a Sotāpanna, died in the room where he 
was born (*3).</p>
