<p>A ford on the Ganges, on the direct route from 
<a href="veranjaa.htm" title="vy/veranjaa.htm">Verañjā</a> to 
Benares, the road passing through <a href="soreyya.htm" title="s/soreyya.htm">Soreyya</a>, 
<a href="sankassa.htm" title="sa/sankassa.htm">Sankassa</a> and <a href="kannakujja.htm" title="ka/kannakujja.htm">Kannakujja</a>, and crossing 
the Ganges at Payāga (Vin.iii.11). </p>
<p>It was one of the river ghats where people 
did ceremonial bathing to wash away their sins (M.i.39; J.vi.198). It was here 
that the palace occupied by <a href="mahapanaada.htm" title="maha/mahapanaada.htm">Mahāpanāda</a> was submerged. The 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> passed 
it when visiting the brahmin <a href="nanduttara.htm" title="n/nanduttara.htm">Nanduttara</a>, and 
<a href="bhaddaji_s.htm" title="b/bhaddaji_s.htm">Bhaddaji</a>, who was with him, raised 
the palace once more above the water. Bhaddaji had once been Mahāpanāda 
(Mhv.xxxi.6ff). </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (MA.i.145; DA.iii.856) the bathing place was on 
the spot where the palace stairs had stood. Reference is made to Payāga even in 
the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha (AA.i.126). </p>
<p>It is identified with the modern Allahabad, at the 
confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā.</p>
