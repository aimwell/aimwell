<p>An arahant. In the time of Vipass카 
Buddha he was a householder in Bandhumat카, where he tended his blind parents. 
Being prevented by his parents' affliction from joining the Order, he repeated 
the Three Refuges under a monk, named Nisabha, and honoured them throughout his 
life of one hundred thousand years. He was eighty times born as king of the 
gods. In this last life he was born in a rich family in S훮vatthi, and, having 
heard the Buddha preach, became an arahant at the age of seventy-seven.
