  <h2>Mangala Jātaka (No. 87). </h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once an Udicca-brahmin who, having 
entered the ascetic life, lived in Himavā. He one day visited Rājagaha, and the 
king invited him to stay in the Royal Park. While he was there, a brahmin who 
believed in omens as shown by clothes (Dussalakkhana brāhmana) found a garment 
in his chest which had been gnawed by mice, and, fearing disaster, wished to 
have it thrown out into the charnel ground. Unwilling to entrust the job to 
anyone else, he gave the clothes to his son to throw away. The Bodhisatta saw 
the garment and picked it up in spite of the grave warnings of the old brahmin, 
saying that no wise man should believe in omens.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a superstitious brahmin 
of Rājagaha who had his clothes thrown away in the manner related above. The 
Buddha was waiting in the charnel field and picked up the garments. When the 
brahmin protested, he related to him the story and preached to him on the folly 
of paying heed to superstitions. At the end of the sermon, father and son became 
sotāpannas. The characters in both stories are the same. J.i.371ff.</p>
