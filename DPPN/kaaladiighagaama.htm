<p>A village in Ceylon, evidently near 
Kalyāni Vihāra, for the monks of the vihāra are spoken of as visiting the 
village for alms. A girl of the village once met a young monk who went there, 
and fell in love so deeply that she died of her longing for him; when the monk 
realised what he had missed by not being aware of her love, he, too, died of a 
broken heart. SnA.i.70; ApA.i.128; the story is slightly different in AA.i.13f</p>
