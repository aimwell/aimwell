<p>If a man were to catch six animals — a 
snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal and a monkey — and tether them with 
ropes, they would struggle to be free and to make off, each to his own range or 
pasture. So do a man’s six senses. If the animals are strongly tethered, they 
will, with time, grow weary and rest. So will the six senses if one practises 
attention to the body. S.iv.197; cp. Vsm.484.</p>
