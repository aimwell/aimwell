  <h2>Alagadd큰pama Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Jetavana to Arittha 
concerning his heresy. Arittha held that according to the Doctrine, as he 
understood it, the states of mind, e.g. pleasures of sense, declared by the 
Buddha to be stumbling-blocks, are not such at all to the man who indulges in 
them. The Buddha questioned Arittha regarding this, and when Arittha 
acknowledged that such was his view, the Buddha rebuked him as having not even a 
spark of illumination regarding the Dhamma and the Vinaya.</p>
<p>Foolish persons, who have learned the 
Doctrine by heart but fail to study its import, quite miss the real meaning of 
their memorising and find no joy in it, using it solely as a means of stricture 
on others or of bandying verbal quotations; they are like a man who, finding a 
serpent, seizes it by its tail or coils and gets bitten, meeting thereby death 
or deadly hurt. But those, who comprehend all that the Doctrine embodies, 
resemble a man who pins a serpent securely down with a forked stick and grasps 
it firmly by its neck.</p>
<p>This sutta also contains the parable of 
the raft. The Doctrine is like a raft to be used in crossing the flood and then 
to be abandoned. Even good things must eventually be discarded, therefore, how 
much more bad things?</p>
<p>The last part of the sutta contains 
questions, chiefly on the mastery of self, asked by various monks, which the 
Buddha proceeds to explain (M.i.130ff.; MA.i.321ff). The sutta is quoted by 
Buddhaghosa (MA.i.136) as an example of a discourse of which the meaning is 
illustrated by a variety of similes (atthena upamam pariv훮retv훮). (v.l. Alagadda 
Sutta.)</p>
