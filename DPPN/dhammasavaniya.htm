<p>A thera who attained arahantship at the 
age of seven, having heard the Buddha preach the stanza beginning with “aniccā 
vata sankhārā.” </p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a Jatila who, while flying through the air, was forced to descend where the 
Buddha sat preaching, it being impossible to fly over him. He was afterwards 
born in Tāvatimsa. Ap.i.273f.</p>
