<p>A village near <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, where the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> spent his last vassa. This was ten months before his death (SA.iii.198). According to the 
Commentaries (e.g., UdA.322; SA.iii.172) the Buddha did not go straight from 
Beluva to Vesāli, but turned back to <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. He fell grievously ill during 
this period, but, by a great effort of will, overcame his sickness. During this 
sickness <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sākka</a> ministered to the Buddha, waiting on him and carrying on his head 
the Buddha’s stools when he suffered from acute dysentery (DhA.iii.269 f.).</p>
<p>It was at this time that the Buddha, in answer to a 
question by <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>, said that he had kept nothing back from his disciples and 
had no special instructions for the Order to follow after his death. Each 
disciple must work out his own salvation. D.ii.98 ff.; S.v.151ff.</p>
<p>Ānanda is also mentioned as having stayed at Beluva after 
the Buddha’s death. The householder <a href="dasama.htm" title="d/dasama.htm">Dasama</a> of 
<a href="a5_az.htm#Atthakanagara" title="aa/a5_az.htm#Atthakanagara">Atthakanagara</a> sought him there, 
amid their conversation is recorded in the <a href="atthaka_naagara_s.htm" title="ay/atthaka_naagara_s.htm">Atthakanagara Sutta</a> (M.i.349ff.; 
A.v.342ff). </p>
<p>Beluva was a small village, and when the Buddha was there 
the monks stayed in Vesāli. Beluva was just outside the gates of Vesāli 
(SA.iii.165) and was to the south of this city (MA.ii.571).</p>
<p>The Theragāthā (vs.919) states that <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> died at Veluvagāma in the Vajjī country. This probably refers to Beluvagāma, in which 
case Veluva is a varia lectio.</p>
