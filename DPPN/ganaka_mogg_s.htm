  <h2>Ganaka-Moggallāna Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The one hundred and seventh sutta of the 
Majjhima Nikāya; preached to Ganaka-Moggallāna. Moggallāna says that the 
brahmanical training is a thoroughly graduated system (anupub-basikkhā 
anupubbakiriyā). Can the Buddha say the same of his teaching? The Buddha says he 
can and proceeds to explain. It is true that not all the Buddha’s disciples 
attain to the goal, but the fault is theirs; the Buddha accepts no 
responsibility, he only indicates the way. M.iii.1ff.</p>
