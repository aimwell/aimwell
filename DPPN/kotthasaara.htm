<p>A village to the east of Pulatthipura. 
It was once the refuge of Vikkamabāhu II (Cv.lxi.43) and, again, of Gajabāhu 
(Cv.lxx.355). After Gajabāhu’s death his ministers took his body to Kotthasāra, 
and the village became the headquarters of Mānābharana (Cv.lxxi.6, 11). There 
was in the village a garrison for mercenary soldiers, specially occupied by the 
Keralas, and this garrison once revolted against Parakkamabāhu I (Cv.lxxiv.44).</p>
<p>Later, the Damilas, Māgha and Jayabāhu, 
set up a fortification there (Cv.lxxxiii.15; see also Cv.Trs.i.229, n.1). It was 
evidently a point of strategic importance.</p>
