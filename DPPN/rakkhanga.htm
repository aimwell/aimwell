<p>A country (modern Arakan) from which Vimaladhammasūriya I. obtained a number 
of monks, headed by Nandicakka, in order to re establish the upasampadā in 
Ceylon (Cv.xciv.15). Vimaladhammasūriya II. did likewise (Cv.xcvii.10; see also 
Cv.Trs.ii.239, n.1); so did Vijayarājasīha (Cv.xcviii.89; see also 
Cv.Trs.ii.253, n.2). The last two were helped in their enterprise by the Dutch. 
Kittisirirājasīha (Cv.xcix.25) is mentioned as having paid special honour to the 
monks from Rakkhanga.</p>
