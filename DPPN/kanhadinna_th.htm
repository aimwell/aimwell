<p>An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin 
family in Rājagaha. Having heard Sāriputta preach, he entered the Order and 
became an arahant. In the past he met the Buddha Sobhita and offered him a 
punnāga-flower (Thag.v.179; ThagA.i.304).</p>
<p>He is evidently the same as Kanhadinna, 
son of Bhāradvāja Thera (ThagA.i.303), and is probably identical with 
Giripunnāgiya of the Apadāna (ii.416).</p>
