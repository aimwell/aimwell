<p>1. Kukkuta Jātaka (No.383).-The story of 
a cat who tried to deceive a cock — with the idea of eating him — by offering to 
become his wife. Her efforts failed. The cock was the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was told to a monk who was 
tempted by the sight of a woman (J.iii.265f).</p>
<p>This Jātaka is illustrated in the 
Bharhut Stūpa. Cunningham: Pl.xlvii.5.</p>
<p>2. Kukkuta Jātaka (No.448).-The 
Bodhisatta was once the chief of a large flock of fowls. A falcon, by means of 
engaging speech, tried to become friendly with him in order to eat him, but his 
attempts failed. There could be no friendship between fowl and falcon, said the 
Bodhisatta. The story was related in reference to Dedavatta’s attempts to kill 
the Buddha. v.l. Kukkuha. J.iv.55ff</p>
