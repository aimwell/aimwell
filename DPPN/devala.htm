<p><b>1. Devala.</b>-An ascetic who once came from 
the region of Himavā in search of vinegar and honey and took refuge for the 
night in a potter’s house. Another ascetic, Nārada (the Bodhisatta), arrived 
later at the hut and, with the permission of Devala, stayed there. During the 
night, Nārada, going out of the hut, trod on the locks of Devala who lay right 
across the doorway. He asked for pardon, and returning, passed by what he took 
to be Devala’s feet, but Devala had turned round and Nārada again trod on his 
hair. Devala thereupon cursed him, saying that, at sunrise, his head would split 
in seven pieces; but Nārada stopped the sun from rising. The king enquired as to 
what had happened, and, on learning the story, forced Devala to ask Nārada’s 
pardon. As he did not do this of his own free will, he was taken, at Nārada’s 
suggestion, to a pond and made to stand up to his neck in water with a lump of 
clay on his head. As soon as the sun rose the lump of clay split in seven pieces 
and Devala swam away. Devala is identified with Thulla-Tissa. DhA.i.32ff.</p>

<p><b>3. Devala</b>.-Cousin of Padumuttara Buddha 
and later his aggasāvaka. Padumuttara’s first sermon was addressed to him and 
his brother Sujāta. Bu.xi.24; BuA.159; Ap.i.106.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Devala.</b>-An ascetic in Himavā. He 
lived before the time of Padumuttara Buddha, who was yet in Tusita, but 
realizing in his mind the qualities of previous Buddhas, Devala built a cetiya 
on the bank of a river and made offerings to it in the name of the Buddha. 
Later, he was born in the Brahma-world. He was a previous birth of Sirimatthera 
(Pulinuppādaka).</p>
<p>ThagA.i.280; Ap.ii.426.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Devala.</b>-A Pacceka Buddha. When Upāli 
was once born as Sunanda, the king’s son, one day, when riding on an elephant, 
he saw Devala and insulted him. It was for this reason that he was born in a low 
caste in his last life. ThagA.i.368.</p>
