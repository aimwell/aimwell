  <h2>Assutavata Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>The untaught might well be repelled by 
the body, seeing its decay, but not by the mind or consciousness, which is like 
a monkey letting go of one thing only to grasp another. </p>
<p>The well-taught disciple is repelled not 
only by the body but by all the khandhas and wishes to be free from them. 
S.iv.94.</p>
