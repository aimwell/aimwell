<p>A Lambakanna, son of Dāthāpabhuti. He fled to Jambudīpa, 
through fear of Kassapa I., and became a monk in the Bodhimanda-vihāra. There, 
because of a mango which he presented to the community, he came to be known as 
Ambasāmanera.  </p>
<p>In the time of Moggallāna I., he brought the Buddha’s Hair Relic 
to Ceylon and was greatly honoured by the king. Silākāla returned to the lay 
life, and Moggallāna appointed him sword bearer to the relic — hence his name, 
Asiggāhaka-Silākāla.  </p>
<p>He married the king’s sister and also the daughter of 
Upatissa III. He then returned to the Malaya district, where he rebelled against 
Upatissa. He defeated the king’s son, Kassapa, who committed suicide, and when 
Upatissa died of grief, Silākāla became king under the name of 
Ambasāmanera-Silākāla, ruling for thirteen years (524-37 A.C.).  </p>
<p>He had three 
sons: Moggallāna, Dāthāpabhuti and Upatissa. Cv.xxxix. 44, 55; xli.10ff.</p>
