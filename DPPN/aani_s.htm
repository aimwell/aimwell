<p>Like the Ānaka drum of the Dasārahas, in 
which the drumhead vanished, leaving only the framework of pegs, even so is it 
with the Suttantas of the Tathāgata which are deep in meaning. They lie 
neglected and forgotten while men will turn their attention to the Suttantas of 
poets and the utterances of disciples, full of words; these they will learn and 
master instead of the Buddha’s own teachings. S.ii.266-7.</p>
