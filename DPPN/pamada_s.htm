<p>1. Two Pacceka Brahmās, Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa, came to see 
the Buddha, but finding him engaged in meditation, decided to visit a certain 
infatuated (pamatta) Brahmā in a certain Brahma world. On their suggesting to 
him that he should visit the Buddha, he reproduced himself one thousand times 
and said he had greater iddhi power than the Buddha. But Subrahmā reproduced 
himself two thousand times, and pointed out that the Buddha’s iddhi power 
exceeded theirs. It is said that the infatuated Brahmā visited the Buddha later.
