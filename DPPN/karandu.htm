<p>King of Dantapura in the Kālinga 
kingdom. One day in his park he ate mangoes from a tree laden with fruit; his 
retinue doing likewise, the tree was soon stripped bare. Returning home, the 
king noticed the state of the tree and compared it with another tree which, 
having no fruit, was spared such ravages. Reflecting on this topic, he became a 
Pacceka Buddha and went to the Nandamūla-pabbhāra with three others — Naggaji, 
Nimi, and Dummukha. The story of these four is given in the Kumbhakāra Jātaka.
