<h2>Mahﾄ」acchagotta Sutta</h2>
<p>The Paribbﾄ）aka Vacchagotta visits the Buddha at Veluvana 
and asks him to expound right and wrong. The Buddha does so, and adds that those 
who follow his teaching are sure of deliverance and of birth in happy worlds and 
are destined for Nibbﾄ］a. Vacchagotta is very pleased and seeks admission to the 
Order, but the Buddha says that he must first pass four months as a probationer. 
At the end of that time he enters the Order and the Buddha further expounds the 
Doctrine to him. Shortly after he becomes an Arahant. M.i.489 97.</p>
