<p>He was once an officer of Pasenadi, but later left the 
world. A conversation between him and Dhanuggahatissa it was which, overheard by 
Pasenadi’s spies, led to Pasenadi changing his tactics and defeating Ajātasattu. 
J.iv.343; but see J.ii.403, where Dhanuggatissa’s companion is called Utta, 
which is probably a wrong reading of Datta. </p>
<p>In the conversation Mantidatta is addressed as Datta, 
which was evidently his personal name, the prefix Manti being given him as the 
king’s minister and to distinguish him from other Dattas.</p>
