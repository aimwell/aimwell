<p>One of the <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavi</a> chieftains of 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> 
during the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> time. He was a nihilist by persuasion.</p>
<p>Once while going through the city he saw 
a beautiful woman. Wishing to possess her, he commandeered her husband’s 
services and one day ordered him to bring mud and lotuses from a pond three 
leagues away, his life to be the penalty if he did not return the same evening. 
Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than 
usual. The woman’s husband returned to the city before nightfall, but finding 
the gates shut, he asked a thief, who was impaled just outside, to bear witness 
to his having arrived before sunset.</p>
<p>The thief’s uncle had been a pious 
merchant in Vesāli, but had been beheaded for alleged implication in his 
nephew’s theft. He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he 
possessed various powers. By reason, however, of having once hidden, in jest, 
the clothes of a friend who was bathing in the river, he was born naked. Every 
night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of 
his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief 
after death.</p>
<p>When the man with the lotuses asked the 
thief’s assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta’s 
arrival that night and to get his counsel. This the man did, and when, the next 
day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his 
defence. Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he 
saw the peta and learnt all that had happened. Greatly marvelling, he offered to 
help the peta in getting rid of his nudity. He was asked to seek the holy Elder 
<a href="kappitaka_th.htm" title="ka/kappitaka_th.htm">Kappitaka</a> who lived in 
<a href="kapinacanaa.htm" title="ka/kapinacanaa.htm">Kapinaccanā</a> in the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajji</a> country and give him robes in 
the peta’s name. This was done, and the peta immediately appeared before them 
clad in heavenly robes. From that time Ambasakkhara was converted to the Faith, 
and after having listened to a sermon by Kappitaka became a Sotāpanna. 
</p>
<p>The impaled thief was set free and was 
cured by the royal physician; he later attained to the state of an arahant.
