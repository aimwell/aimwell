<p>The Bodhisatta. was once an ox named Mahālohita and his 
brother was Cullalohita. They both belonged to a village family, and when the 
girl of the family grew up and was married, a pig, called Sālūka, was fattened 
for the feast. Cullalohita, saw this and coveted the food which was being given 
to the pig, but when he complained to his brother, it was explained to him that 
the pig’s lot was an unhappy one.</p>
<p>The introductory story is given in the Culla Nāradakassapa 
Jātaka. Sālūka is identified with the love sick monk of that story, and 
Cullalohita with Ānanda. J.ii.419f.</p>
