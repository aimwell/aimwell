<p>She belonged to a household in Rājagaha and was a friend 
of Khemā. When Khemā left the world, Vijayā went to her, and, having listened to 
her teaching, joined the Order under her, attaining arahantship soon afterwards 
(ThigA.159f.; her Udāna verses are included in Thig.169 74.). She may be 
identical with the Vijayā, mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.130) a 
Bhikkhunī whom Māra, assuming the form of a young main, tried unsuccessfully to 
tempt.</p>
