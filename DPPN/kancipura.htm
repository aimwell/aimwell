<p>A city in 
Southern India on the Coromandel coast, capital of the Pallavas, and one of the 
seven sacred towns of India; it is the modern Conjevaram. It was once the centre 
of Buddhism in South India and was one of the places of pilgrimage visited by 
Hiouien Thsang. He mentions that during his stay there three hundred monks came 
to Kāñcipura from Ceylon, fleeing from the political disturbances in that 
country (Beal, op. cit., ii.228f; CAGI.627). In Pali Literature the locality is 
noteworthy as the birthplace of the Commentator Dhammapāla and perhaps also of 
Anuruddha, author of the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha (P.L.C.113, 169). Some identify 
Kāñcipura with Satiyaputta of Asoka’s Rock Edict II. E.g., J.R.A.S., 1918, 541f; 
see also Bhandarkar, Anct. Hist. of Deccan pp.47, 52.</p>
