<p>An Ājīvaka. He came of a wagon building stock of bygone 
days. In the Anangana Sutta (M.i.31f), Moggallāna tells Sāriputta that, one day, 
when begging alms in Rājagaha, he came to the house of Samīti, the wagon builder 
who was shaping a felloe. Standing by was Panduputta, watching him and wishing 
that he should shape it without blemish. When Samīti did so, Panduputta 
expressed his joy, saying that Samīti had read his thoughts.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.124) that Panduputta was so called 
because he was the son of Pandu.</p>
