<p>A hunter. The daughter of a rich man in 
Rājagaha looks out of her window on the seventh storey and seeing the hunter 
pass through the street, falls in love with him. Learning from her slave that he 
is leaving the city the next day, she leaves her home secretly, joins 
Kukkutamitta on the road and elopes with him. Seven sons are born to them who, 
in course of time, marry and set up households of their own. One day, perceiving 
that the whole family is ripe for conversion, the Buddha goes to the place where 
Kukkutamitta’s nets are spread, leaves there his footprint and sits down under a 
tree. The hunter, having caught nothing, suspects that someone has set the 
animals free and on seeing the Buddha draws his bow. By the Buddha’s power he is 
rooted to the spot, and likewise his sons who come with their wives to seek him. 
Kukkutamitta’s wife also comes, and seeing what has happened exclaims in 
riddling phrase: “Do not kill my father.” (It transpires that she had become a 
sotāpanna while yet a girl.) The family ask pardon of the Buddha, and all become 
sotāpannas. When the monks hear of this, they complain that Kukkutamitta’s wife, 
though a sotāpanna, had all this while assisted her husband to take life. The 
Buddha assures them that such is not the case. A man may take poison in his 
hand, but if there be no wound there no harm comes to him.</p>
<p>In a previous existence, a county 
treasurer bid against a city treasurer for the principal share in the building 
of a shrine for the relics of Kassapa Buddha. When the city treasurer bid more 
than the county treasurer possessed, the latter offered to devote himself to the 
service of the shrine, together with his wife, his seven sons and their wives. 
Kukkutamitta was the county treasurer. DhA.iii.24-31.</p>
