<p>A warrior. In the time of Kassapa Buddha 
he gave milk-rice to monks for 20,000 years. Later he was born in Kubukandha and 
joined Dutthagāmani, taking a prominent part in the capture of Mahela-nagara. 
Then the king’s mind was poisoned against him and an elephant was let loose on 
him. But he killed it and went to Mahājallika, where he defeated a fisherman of 
immense strength, then swam across to Cola and was ordained by Mahāvaruna Thera.</p>
<p>He lived for a time in Therambalaka 
Vihāra, sixty leagues away;&nbsp; but finding it unsuitable, he moved to 
Lohakūtapabbata-vihāra, fifteen leagues away, and there attained arahantship. 
Ras.ii.104f.</p>
