<p>Sāriputta addresses the monks at Jetavana and tells them 
that, just as the foot of every creature will fit in the elephant’s footprint, 
even so are all right states of mind comprised within the Four Noble Truths. He 
then goes on to explain that dukkha consists of the five upādānakkhandhas&nbsp;&nbsp; 
visible shapes, feelings, perception, sankhāras and consciousness. The 
constituents of these attachments are the four principle elements: earth, water, 
fire, and air. Each element is of two kinds personal (ajjhatta) and external (bahiddhā) 
- and each is transient and subject to decay. The chain of causation entails all 
that makes up the five attachments. Where there is eye intact, on which external 
shapes come to focus, and where there is developed pertinent material to sustain 
it, there is developed a manifestation of the pertinent section of 
consciousness. Thus arises the upādānakkhandha of form; similarly with the 
others. M.i.184 91.</p>
