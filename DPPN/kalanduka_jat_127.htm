  <h2>Kalanduka Jātaka (No.127)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Kalanduka was the servant of the 
Treasurer of Benares. He ran away, and with the help of a forged letter, just as 
did Katāhaka (q.v.), married the daughter of a border merchant.</p>
<p>The Treasurer sent a parrot to seek for 
him. The parrot saw him hawking and spitting out milk at his wife’s head in 
order to assert his power, and, wishing to teach him a lesson, threatened to 
expose him. The Treasurer, hearing from the parrot of Kalanduka’s whereabouts, 
had him brought back and reduced again to slavedom. J.i.458.</p>
