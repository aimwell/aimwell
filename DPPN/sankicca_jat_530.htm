<h2>Sankicca Jātaka (No. 530)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in the family of the chaplain 
of the king of Benares and was educated in <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, with the king’s son. They 
became great friends, and, when the prince became viceroy, they lived together. 
The prince, having conceived the plan of killing his father in order to become 
king, confided this idea to Sankicca. The latter tried to dissuade him, but 
finding his efforts in vain, he fled to the Himālaya, where he became an 
ascetic. The prince killed his father, but was later filled with remorse and 
could find no peace of mind. He longed to see Sankicca, but it was not till 
fifty years later that Sankicca, with five hundred followers, came to the garden 
of Dayāpassa in Benares. The king visited him and questioned him on the results 
of wickedness. Sankicca described the horrors of hell awaiting the wicked, 
illustrating his story with stories  </p>
<ul>
  <li>of <a href="ajjuna.htm" title="am/ajjuna.htm">Ajjuna</a> who annoyed the sage Gotama, 
  </li>
  <li>of <a href="dandakii.htm" title="d/dandakii.htm">Dandaki</a>, who defied Kisavaccha, </li>
  <li>of the king of <a href="mejjha.htm" title="me_mu/mejjha.htm">Mejjha</a>, whose country became a 
desert, </li>
  <li>of the <a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">Andhavenhudāsaputtā</a> who assailed Dīpāyana, and of Cecca, 
swallowed up by the earth. </li>
</ul>
<p>After describing the terrors awaiting the victims of 
various hells, Sankicca showed the king the deva worlds and ended his discourse, 
indicating the possibility of making amends.</p>
<p>The king was much comforted and changed his ways. </p>
<p>He is identified with <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, in 
reference to whose parricide and its consequences the story was related. It was 
not till Ajātasattu sought the Buddha and listened to his preaching that he 
found peace of mind. J.v.261-77.</p>
