<p>A monastery attached to the 
Kalyāni-cetiya. It was from the earliest times the residence of eminent monks, 
such as Dhammagutta (the Earth-shaker) and his five hundred colleagues 
(Mhv.xxxii.51) and of Godattatthera (MA.i.100). Here a thera, called Pindapātiya, 
once recited the Brahmajāla Sutta, and the earth trembled as he finished his 
recital (DA.i.131). Near the vihāra was the village of Kāladīghavāpigāma, where 
monks who lived in the monastery went for alms (SnA.i.70; AA.i.13).</p>
<p>King Kanittha-Tissa built in this 
monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxvi.17). Vijayabāhu III. restored the vihāra, 
which had been damaged by the Damilas, and reconstructed the cetiya, crowning it 
with a golden finial. He also built a gate-tower on the eastern side 
(Cv.lxxxi.59f).</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century Alagakkonāra 
seems to have bestowed great patronage on the monastery, and to have done many 
things for its improvement (See Ceylon Antiquary and Literary Register i.152; 
ii.149, 182).</p>
<p>Even in the fifteenth century the 
monastery was evidently considered one of the chief centres of the Sangha in 
Ceylon, for we find that the monks, sent by Dhammaceti from Rāmañña to Ceylon, 
received their ordination in the sīmā of Kalyāni-vihāra, and that on their 
return they consecrated a sīmā in Pegu known as the Kalyāni-sīmā (Bode, op. 
cit., 38).</p>
