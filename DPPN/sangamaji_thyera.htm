  <h2>Sangāmaji Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was the son of a very rich setthi of Benares. When he 
came of age, his parents married him and he had a son. One day he joined a party 
of people going to Jetavana, and, at the conclusion of the Buddha’s sermon, 
asked the Buddha to ordain him. But the Buddha wished him to have his parent’s 
leave. This he obtained only with the greatest difficulty and with the promise 
to visit them later. After ordination he lived in a forest grove, and soon 
afterwards attained arahantship.</p>
<p>When he returned to Sāvatthi, after having paid homage to 
the Buddha, he spent the noonday under a tree. His parents, hearing of his 
arrival, went to see him. Their efforts to persuade him to return to lay life 
were too insistent, and he would not even speak to them. They returned 
discomfited and sent his wife and son to him. His wife appealed to him with 
various arguments, but he refused even to look at her. She then placed the child 
on his lap and went away. When she discovered that Sangāmaji would not even talk 
to his son, she took him away, saying that her husband was a useless man. 
</p>
<p>The Buddha saw all this with his divine eye and expressed 
his joy in verse. Ud.i.8; UdA.71ff.; the verse is quoted at Netti, p.150.</p>
<p>Posiya Thera was Sangāmaji’s younger brother. ThagA.i.97.</p>
