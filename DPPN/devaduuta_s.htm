  <h2>Devadūta Sutta</h2>

<p>Deals with the three warning messengers 
of death — the sight of old age, the sight of illness and the sight of death. 
The man who fails to pay heed to these messengers and is guilty of 
unrighteousness is condemned by Yama to the tortures of the Mahānirayas, which 
are described in detail (A.i.138f; cp. Makhādeva Jātaka).</p>
<p>The same sutta, with several variations, 
is given at greater length in the Majjhima Nikāya (M.iii.178ff), where five 
messengers are spoken of, the first and fourth being the sight of a new-born 
babe and the sight of a guilty robber being punished for his offences 
respectively. The sutta is referred to for a description of Avīci (DhA.i.107; 
also AA.i.21). It was preached by Mahādeva to the people of 
Mahisamandala (Mhv.xii.29; Mbv.114), and by Mahinda at Anurādhapura, on the 
first day of the latter’s arrival there, when one thousand people became 
sotāpannas (Mhv.xiv.63).</p>
<p>The Majjhima version of the sutta is 
given (E.g., MA.i.135) as an example of a discourse where the Buddha starts the 
sermon with a simile and then preaches the Doctrine.</p>
