<p>An arahant. In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a 
Yakkha, and, learning that the Buddha had died before he could pay him homage, 
he was filled with grief. The Buddha’s disciple, Sāgara, advised him to honour 
the Buddha’s Thūpa, and this he did for five years. </p>
<p>Seven kappas ago he became king four times under the name 
of Bhūiripañña (Ap.i.153). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Ekūdāniya Thera. 
ThagA.i.153f.</p>
