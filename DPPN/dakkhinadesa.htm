<p>A province of Ceylon, the territory west 
of the mountains and reaching up to the sea. It was so called from the relation 
of its position to that of Anurādhapura. At one time it was united with the 
Malayarattha and formed part of the territory governed by the king’s second son 
(E.g., Cv.xli.35; but see Cv.Trs.i.54, n.4). Later, it seems to have become the 
special province of the heir-apparent (E.g., Cv.xliii.8; xliv.84; lxv.23; 
lxviii.33; li.12, etc.).</p>
<p>It is also referred to as Dakkhinapassa 
(E.g., Cv.lviii.41) and Dakkhinabhāga.</p>
<p>Among the strongholds of Dakkhinadesa 
are mentioned Muhunnaru, Badalatthala, Vāpināgara, Buddhagāma, Tilagulla, 
Mahāgalla and Mandagalla (Cv.lviii.42), and among its villages, Punkhagāma 
(Cv.lxi.42) and Bodhisenapabbata (Cv.lxi.33).</p>
