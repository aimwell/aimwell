<p>The Pāli name for the modern town of Kurunegala in Ceylon. 
It is so called because near by is a mountain shaped like a reclining elephant. 
It is first mentioned in the time of Parakkamabāhu II., who made his yuvarāja, 
Bhuvanekabāhu, build a vihāra there (Cv.lxxxv.62). </p>
<p>The king was cremated close to the vihāra, and his son, 
Vijayabāhu, made a pilgrimage to the vihāra, and to the place of cremation 
(Cv.lxxxviii.53f). Bhuvanekabāhu removed the capital from Subhagiri to 
Hatthigiripura, where it remained till the death of Parakkamabāhu IV. 
Cv.xc.59,106.</p>
