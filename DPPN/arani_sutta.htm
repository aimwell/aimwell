<p>There are five indriyas: those of ease, 
discomfort, happiness, unhappiness and indifference. Just as from the rubbing 
together of two sticks warmth and heat are produced, so, from their separation, 
warmth and heat, thus born, are quenched; similarly from contact, experienced as 
agreeable, arises the faculty of ease (sukhindriya), etc. S.v.211-13.</p>
