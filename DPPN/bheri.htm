  <h2>Bherī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A female ascetic who was often invited to the palace of 
King Videha, where she heard of the wisdom of Mahosadha and wished to meet him. 
One day she met him on her way to the palace and questioned him by means of dumb 
signs, to which Mahosadha replied in the same way. Queen Nandās confidantes saw 
this, and reported to the king that Mahosadha and Bherī were conspiring to kill 
him. But the king questioned each of the two separately, and, satisfied with 
their innocence, appointed Mahosadha commander in chief (J.vi.467f). </p>
<p>Bherī is identified with Uppalavannā (J.vi.478).
