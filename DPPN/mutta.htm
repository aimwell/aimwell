<p><b><span lang="en-us">1. Muttā Therī<span lang="en-us">.
</b>She belonged to an eminent brahmin family of 
Sāvatthi and, in her twentieth year, renounced the world under Pajāpatī Gotamī.
</p>
<p>One day, as she meditated after her return from the alms 
round, the Buddha appeared before her in a ray of glory and exhorted her in a 
verse. Not long after she became an arahant. </p>
<p>In the past, she had seen Vipassī Buddha walking along the 
street and, gladdened by the sight, had rushed out and thrown herself at his 
feet (Thig.vs.2; ThigA.8f). </p>
<p>She is evidently identical with Sankamanattā of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.514.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Muttā Therī<span lang="en-us">. </b>
She was the daughter of Oghātaka, a poor brahmin of Kosala, 
and was given in marriage to a hunch backed brahmin. Unwilling to live with him, 
she persuaded him to allow her to join the Order, where she soon became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she showed the Buddha 
great honour when he visited her city. Thig.vs.11; ThigA.14f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Muttā. </b>An eminent upāsikā, mentioned in a list 
of such. A.iv.347; AA.ii.791.</p>
