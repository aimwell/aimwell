<h2>Mahāsīva</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahāsīva.</b> King of Ceylon; he was the son of 
Mutasīva and the younger brother of Uttiya, whom he succeeded. He reigned for 
ten years (197 87 B.C.) and built the Nagarangana vihāra for Bhaddasāla Thera. 
He was succeeded by Sūratissa. Mhv.xxi.1ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahāsīva Thera.</b> Resident of Vāmantapabbhāra. He 
was among the last of the arahants, and had taken part in various assemblies led 
by the Bodhisatta (J.iv.490; vi. 30). It is probably this Thera who is 
referred to as <b>Gāmantapabbhāravāsī</b> Mahāsīva in the Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.i.24, 29). He lived in Tissamahārāma at Mahāgāma, and was the teacher of 
eighteen groups of monks. One of his pupils became an arahant, and, being aware 
that his teacher was yet a puthujjana, went to him and asked his leave to be 
taught a stanza. But Mahāsīva said his pupils were so numerous that he had no 
time to give him a stanza. The pupil waited for a whole day and night, and then 
getting no chance of learning, said, “If you are so busy now how will you find 
time to die?” Mahāsīva heard and understood, and exerted himself strenuously for 
thirty long years, at the end of which time he became an arahant.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahāsīva.</b> A famous Commentator, sometimes called 
Dīghabhānaka Mahāsīva. His interpretations are quoted, with respect, in the 
Commentaries. E.g., DA.ii.430, 511, 543, 554, 805, 881, 883; SA.iii.171, 198; 
Sp.iii.711; DhSA. 405; PSA. 80; AA.ii.490.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mahāsīva Thera.</b> An incumbent of Bhātivanka, 
during the reign of Dutthagāmanī. One day he went to worship at the Mahā Thūpa, 
and there he saw two devatās offering flowers. In their previous lives they were 
two women who had worked for hire on the Mahā Thūpa. Mhv.xxx.46ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Mahāsīva Thera.</b> Incumbent of Nigrodhapitthi and 
expert in the Tipitaka. Once, while preaching the Sīhanāda Sutta in King 
Vasabha’s palace, he described the splendours of the Relic Chamber in the Mahā 
Thūpa and the king expressed some difficulty in believing the report, but the 
Elder was able to convince the king that nothing was impossible where there was 
a combination of rājiddhi, deviddhi and ariyiddhi. The king was pleased, 
conveyed the Elder under the white umbrella to the Mahā Vihāra and made great 
offerings, lasting for seven days, to the Mahā Thūpa. MT. 555.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Mahāsīva Thera.</b> Mentioned as an eminent teacher 
of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3; Sp.i.63). He is probably identical with one of the 
foregoing.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Mahāsīva Thera.</b> It was for him that Aggabodhi I. 
built a parivena and also the Kurunda vihāra with a tank and a grove of coco 
palms. Cv.xlii.11, 16.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Mahāsīva</b>.-A monk of 
Piyangudīpa. See Mahāsena (5).</p>
