<p>The second sutta of the Atthakavagga of 
the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a>; it was preached to
<a href="pindola.htm" title="pu/pindola.htm">Pindolabhāradvāja</a>. He once went to 
<a href="udakavana.htm" title="u/udakavana.htm">Udakavana</a> in <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>, and there the women of King Udena’s palace, who had come 
to the park with the king, left the king while he slept, and, finding the Elder, 
sat down and listened to his preaching. The king, awakening, went in search of 
them, and was angry when he discovered their where-abouts. He questioned Pindola 
as to the solitude which he professed to seek in the park, but Pindola refusing 
to answer, the king threatened to set red ants at him. Thereupon Pindola went 
through the air to the Buddha’s <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a> and related the story. The Buddha was 
reclining on his bed and, in that position, preached this sutta to the Elder.</p>
<p>A man who clings to the body and to the 
pleasures of the senses, lives in constant fear. One should therefore cast off 
greed and cross the flood, unstained by the world (SN.vv.772-9; SNA.ii.514ff).</p>
<p>The sutta probably derives its name from 
the fact that, in the first verse, the body is spoken of as a guhā.</p>
<p>It is commented on in the Mahā Niddesa 
pp.23ff.</p>
