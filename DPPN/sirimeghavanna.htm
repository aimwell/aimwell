He restored the monastic buildings destroyed by Mahāsena and hold a festival in 
the Ambatthala cetiya in honour of Mahinda, of whom he made a life size image of 
gold. He erected the Sotthiyākara-vihāra and built a stone terrace round the 
Tissavasabha bodhi. The Buddha’s Tooth Relic was brought to Ceylon in the ninth 
year of the king’s reign, and the king placed it in the Dhammacakka-pāsāda. He 
held a great festival in honour of the Relic, and decreed that similar festivals 
should be held yearly in the Abhayuttara vihāra. He is said to have built 
eighteen vihāras. He was succeeded by Jetthatissa. Cv.xxxvii.53ff.</p>
