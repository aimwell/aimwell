<p>Arahant. In the past she was a 
slave-girl, a water-carrier in the city of Bandhumatī. Seeing the King Bandhumā 
keeping the fast, she took the precepts herself and kept them well. Sixty-four 
times she became the queen of rulers in heaven, and was sixty-three times queen 
among men. Her complexion was always of a golden hue. In her last life she left 
the world at the age of seven, and attained arahantship within eight months 
(Ap.ii.522f). </p>
<p>She is probably identical with Uttamā 
Therī. See ThigA.46ff.</p>
