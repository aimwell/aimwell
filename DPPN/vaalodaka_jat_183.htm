<p>Once Brahmadatta, king of Benares, went with a large army 
to quell a frontier rebellion, and, on his return, ordered that his horses be 
given some grape juice to drink. The horses drank and stood quietly in their 
stalls. There was a heap of leavings empty of all goodness, and the king ordered 
that these be kneaded with water, strained, and given to the donkeys who carried 
the horses' provender. The donkeys drank it, and galloped about braying loudly. 
The king asked his courtier (the Bodhisatta) the reason for this, and he 
answered that the lowborn lack self control.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to some boys, attendants 
of devotees, at Sāvatthi. The devotees themselves were calm and collected, but 
the boys would eat and then scamper about the banks of the Aciravatī, making 
great uproar. They are identified with the donkeys (J.ii.95f).</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.154f ) the 
story was related after the monks returned to Sāvatthi from Verañjā. Their 
attendants had been quiet in Verañjā, where there was little to eat, but in 
Sāvatthi they ate the remnants of the monks' food and made a great noise.</p>
