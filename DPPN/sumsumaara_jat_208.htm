<p>The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, living on the banks of 
the Ganges. The wife of a crocodile living in the river saw him and wished to 
eat his heart. Her husband, therefore, grew friendly with the monkey, whom he 
suggested taking across the river on his back, so that he might eat of fresh 
fruit on the opposite bank. The monkey trusted him and climbed on to his back, 
but, half way across the river, the crocodile began to sink and then confessed 
his intentions. The monkey thereupon laughed and told him that he never took his 
heart with him when he went climbing trees for food, otherwise it would get torn 
to pieces; but he, like all the other monkeys, hung it on a tree, and he showed 
it to the crocodile hanging there on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>The crocodile believed him and took him across, where he 
hoped to get the heart. But the monkey jumped on the bank and laughed at his 
stupidity.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempts 
to kill the Buddha. The crocodile is identified with Devadatta and his wife with 
Ciñcā. J.ii.159f.; cf. Cyp.iii.7; Mtu.ii.208.</p>
