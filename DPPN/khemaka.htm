<p>1. Khemaka.-A Sākyan of Kapilavatthu, 
father of Abhirūpa-Nandā. See also Kāla-Khemaka. ThigA.25; Ap.ii.608.</p>
<p>2. Khemaka Thera.-An arahant. Once, when 
he lay very ill at the Badarikārāmā, near Kosambī, some monks, staying at the 
Ghositārāma, sent one of their number, Dāsaka, with a message to Khemaka, 
inquiring whether he managed to bear his pains. Dāsaka returned with the reply 
that he did not; he was sent again to ask if Khemaka had seen the self in the 
five khandhas; when Dāsaka returned with the answer that he had not, be was sent 
a third time to ask whether Khemaka was an arahant. “No,” came the answer, and 
Dāsaka had to visit him a fourth time with the inquiry, What did Khemaka mean by 
self? In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositārāma and explained how, 
even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still 
clings to him a subtle remnant of the “I” conceit. It is said that as a result 
of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants (S.iii.126ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.ii.230f) explains 
that the monks wished to hear Khemaka because they knew his ability, and they 
also knew that if they showed keenness to learn he would come to them. They did 
not go to him because his but was small, and they did not actually ask him to 
come to them because he was ill.</p>
<p>3. Khemaka, Khema, Khemanesāda.-The name 
given to the fowler who caught the golden swan from Cittakūta, at the request of 
King Seyya (v.l. Samyama), as narrated in the Mahāhamsa Jātaka (q.v.). Khemaka 
received his name from the lake Khema, of which he was in charge. He is 
identified with Channa (J.v.356ff).</p>
<p>4. Khemaka.-See Khemavatī.</p>
