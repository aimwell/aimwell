<p>The Bodhisatta was a brahmin farmer of Sālindiya. On the 
way to his fields he passed a pond and grew friendly with a golden crab living 
in the pond. A she-crow longed to eat the farmer’s eyes, and persuaded her 
husband to induce a snake to bite the farmer. This he did, and, overcome with 
the poison, the farmer fell near the pool. Attracted by the noise, the crab 
emerged, and, seeing the crow about to peck out the farmer’s eyes, caught the 
crow with his claws. When the snake came to the rescue of the crow, the crab 
fastened on him too. The crab made the snake suck the poison from the farmer’s 
body, and, when he stood up, the crab crushed the necks of both the snake and 
the crow and killed them.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Ānanda’s attempt to 
save the Buddha from the elephant (Dhanapāla) sent by Devadatta to kill him, by 
standing between the elephant and the Buddha.</p>
<p>Māra was the serpent, Devadatta the crow, and Ānanda, the 
crab. Ciñcāmānavikā was the female crow. J.iii.293-8.</p>
