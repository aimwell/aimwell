<p>Khemā, wife of Samyama, king of Benares, had a dream, 
after which she longed to see a golden hamsa preach the law from the royal 
throne. When the king came to know this, he consulted various people, and, 
acting on their advice, had a pond dug to the north of the city in the hope of 
enticing a golden hamsa there, and appointed a fowler, who came to be called 
Khemaka, to look after the pond.</p>
<p>The plan succeeded. Five different kinds of geese came: 
the grass geese, the yellow geese, the scarlet geese, the white geese, and the 
pāka geese.</p>
<p>Dhatarattha, king of the golden geese, who lived in 
Cittakūta, had taken as wife a pakā goose, and at the repeated suggestion of his 
minister, Sumukha, arrived with his flock of ninety thousand, to see the 
wonderful pond at Benares. Khemaka saw them and waited his opportunity. On the 
seventh day he found it, and set a snare in which Dhatarattha was caught. At his 
cry of alarm the flock fled, with the exception of Sumukha, who stayed and asked 
Khemaka for permission to take Dhatarattha’s place. When Sumukha heard why they 
had been caught, he asked that both he and Dhatarattha should be taken before 
Samyama. When Samyama heard of Sumukha’s devotion he was greatly touched, and 
showed the hamsas every possible honour, after asking their forgiveness for the 
way they had been treated. Dhatarattha preached to the queen and the royal 
household, and, having exhorted the king to rule righteously, returned to 
Cittakūta.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Ānanda’s attempt to 
sacrifice his own life for that of the Buddha, when Nālāgiri (q.v.) was sent to 
kill him.</p>
<p>Khemaka was Channa, Khemā the Therī Khemā, the king 
Sāriputta, Sumukha Ānanda, and Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta. J.v.354 82; cp. 
Cullahamsa Jātaka.</p>
