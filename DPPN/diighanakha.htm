</ul>
<p>A Paribbājaka, nephew (sister’s son) of 
Sāriputta. </p>
<p>He visited the Buddha at Sūkarakhatalena 
and the Buddha preached to him the Dīghanakha Sutta, at the end of which he 
became a sotāpanna. </p>
<p>In the sutta he is addressed as 
Aggivessana (M.i.497f; ThagA.ii.95; DhA.i.79).</p>
<p>He was originally an Annihilationist 
(MA.ii.477). Perhaps he is the heretic brahmin, nephew of Sāriputta, who was 
admonished by Moggallāna because he expressed great repugnance at the sight of 
Kassapa. Thag.1108ff; ThagA.ii.180.</p>
