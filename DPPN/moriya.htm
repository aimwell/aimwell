<p>A khattiya clan of India. Among those claiming a share of 
the Buddha’s relics were the Moriyas of Pipphalivana. They came rather late and 
had to be satisfied with a share of the ashes (D.ii.166; Bu.xxviii.4). 
</p>
<p>Candagutta, grandfather of Asoka, was also a Moriyan 
(Mhv.v.16; Dpv.vi.19).</p>
<p>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (MT. 180) contains an account of the 
origin of the name. According to one theory they were so called because they 
rejoiced in the prosperity of their city (attānam nagarasiriyā modāpīti, ettha 
sañjātā ti, dakārassa rakāram katvā Moriyā ti laddhavohārā). They lived in a 
delightful land. Another theory connects the name with mora (peacock). The city 
which they founded had buildings of blue stone, like the neck of the peacock, 
and the place always resounded with the cries of peacocks. It is said that the 
Moriyans were originally Sākyan princes of Kapilavatthu, who escaped to the 
Himālaya regions to save themselves from the attacks of Vidūdabha, and 
established a city there. Thus Asoka was a kinsman of the Buddha, for Candagutta 
was the son of the chief queen of the Moriyan king. The king was killed by a 
neighbouring ruler and the city pillaged. MT.183; but according to the 
Mudrārāksasa (Act iii.) Candragupta, was a Vrsala, a person of low birth, an 
illegitimate son of the last Nanda, king by a Sūdra woman, Murā.</p>
<p>Asoka’s mother, Dhammā, was also a Moriyan princess 
(MT.189). Mention is also made of the Moriyans as a Singhalese clan 
(Cv.xxxviii.13; xli.69; see also Cv.Trs.i.29, n. 2). Whether these had any 
connection with the Moriyans of India is not known.</p>
