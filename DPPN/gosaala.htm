<p>1. Gosāla Thera.-He came from a rich 
family of Magadha and made the acquaintance of Sonakutikanna. When he heard that 
the latter had left the world, he too joined the Order and dwelt on the uplands 
near his native village. One day his mother gave him a meal of rice porridge 
with honey and sugar. After the meal, he made a great effort and won 
arahantship.</p>
<p>Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the rag 
robe of a Pacceka Buddha hanging from a tree trunk and offered flowers in homage 
(Thag.vs.23; ThagA.i.79f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Pamsukūlapūjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.434; but see also Mahākāla.</p>
<p>2. Gosāla.-See Makkhali.</p>
