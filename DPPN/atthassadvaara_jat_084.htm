<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a very 
wealthy setthi in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He had a son who, when only seven years old, showed 
great intelligence and anxiety for his own spiritual welfare. One day the boy 
asked his father which were the paths leading to welfare and on being told them 
he followed their teaching.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
similar child, the son of a wealthy setthi of Sāvatthi. The father, not being 
able to answer the boy’s questions, took him to the Buddha at Jetavana. 
J.i.366-7. </p>
