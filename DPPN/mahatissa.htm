<hr><b>1. Mahātissa.</b> A thera who lived in Bhaggari in 
  Ceylon. He was an arahant, and is mentioned as being among the last of those 
  who took part in various assemblies that followed the departure of the 
  Bodhisatta during different births, such as the Kuddālaka Samāgama, Mūgapakkha, 
  etc. J.vi.30.<hr><b>2. Mahātissa.</b> Called Vanavāsī Mahātissa. He was 
  a colleague of Alindakavāsī&nbsp; Mahāphussadeva of Ceylon, and witnessed 
  Sakka and other deities waiting on the latter in recognition of his holiness. 
  Mahātissa perceived only the radiance of the devas and questioned Phussadeva, 
  who did not, however, give a direct answer. SNA.i.55f.; Vibhā.352.<hr><b>3. Mahātissa Thera.</b> Called Ambakhādaka-Mahātissa. 
  He lived at Ciragumba, and is mentioned as an example of a monk who refused to 
  eat food which came to him as a result of signifying in words that he desired 
  it. Vsm.43.<hr><b>4. Mahātissa Thera. </b>He lived in Cetiyagiri, and 
  one day, while on his way to Anurādhapura, saw a woman who was leaving her 
  husband, having quarrelled with him. She was beautifully dressed, and seeing 
  the Elder, smiled at him, in order to show her perfect teeth. The Elder looked 
  at her, and acquiring the perception of “the foul” through thinking of the 
  bones of her teeth, became an arahant. The husband followed his wife and asked 
  the Elder if he had seen her. The Elder replied, “I know not if it was man or 
  woman, but I saw a lump of bones.” Vsm.20f., 194.<hr><b>5. Mahātissa Thera.</b> Of Punnavallika. One full 
  moon day, at evening, he went to the courtyard of the Mahā Thūpa, saw the 
  moonlight, and turning towards the shrine, entered into rapture, the Buddha 
  being his object of thought. He habitually recalled this experience 
  thenceforth until, one day, he was able to travel through the air to the Mahā 
  Thūpa. Vsm.143; DhSA.116.<hr><b>6. Mahātissa.</b> An Elder of the Mahākarañjiya 
  Vihāra. He became an arahant by developing ānāpānasati, and was thus able to 
  limit his life term. Vsm.292.<hr><b>7. Mahātissa Thera. </b>While begging for alms in 
  Kalyānigāma his mind was defiled by the sight of an “uncommon” form (visabhāgarūpa, 
  naked woman?). SNA.i.6f.<hr><b>8. Mahātissa Thera.</b> An incumbent of the 
  Mandalārāma near Bhokkantagāma. He was a reciter of the Dhammapada. Sumanā, 
  wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, related the story of her past in the assembly of 
  monks in association with this Thera. DhA.iv.51.<hr><b>9. Mahātissa.</b> A man of the Okkāka race, father 
  of Dappula I. His wife was Sanghasivā, and they had two other sons, Aggabodhi 
  and Maniakkhika, and one daughter. Cv.xlv.38.<hr><b>10. Mahātissa Thera.</b> Incumbent of Kotapabbata 
  Viharā and teacher of Asubhakammika Tissa.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was an arahant, and 
  heard, with his divine ear, the description given in the Lohapāsāda by 
  Cittagutta Thera of the marvels of the Mahā Thūpa. Mahātissa told Cittagutta 
  that the description was not full enough. MT. 552f.<hr><b>11. Mahātissa Thera.</b> Incumbent of Kambugallaka 
  Vihāra. He was a colleague of Kupikkala Mahātissa, and interceded on behalf of 
  Vattagāmanī when that king’s ministers wished to leave him. Later, the 
  ministers appointed him to look after all the monasteries built by them. 
  Mhv.xxxiii.76, 89ff.; MT. 619, 622.<hr><b>12. Mahātissa Thera.</b> Incumbent of Kupikkala 
  Vihāra. When Vattagāmanī was in hiding in the forest of Vessagiri, the Elder 
  once provided him with a meal, and the king, out of gratitude, made him a 
  grant of land (Mhv.xxxiii.49). Later, the ministers wanted to revolt against 
  the king on account of his cruelty to Tanasīva, but the Elder and his 
  colleague Mahātissa from Kambugallaka, prevented them from doing so 
  (Mhv.xxxiii.76). When Vattagāmanī built the Abhayagiri Vihāra, he gave it into 
  the charge of Mahātissa. Mhv.xxxiii.83.<hr><b>13. Mahātissa Thera.</b> An incumbent of the 
  Mahāvihāra. He was expelled by reason of his association with families. His 
  pupil Bahalamassutissa thereupon seceded from the Mahāvihāra and established a 
  new sect in Abhayagiri. Mhv.xxxiii.95ff.<hr><b>14. Mahātissa Thera. </b>Incumbent of Anurārāma. 
  Vohārīka Tissa was so pleased with him that he ordered alms to be regularly 
  given to him in the Mucelapattana. Mhv.xxxvi.30.<hr><b>15. Mahātissa Thera. </b>
  Even when sixty years old he did not realize that he was a puthujjana. Then, 
  one day, his pupil Dhammadinna of Talangara came to him, asking for his 
  company in a journey to Tissamahā-vihāra, where he had been asked to preach. 
  Mahātissa greeted him, and in the course of conversation, Dhammadinna 
  discovered that his teacher was under the false impression that he was an 
  arahant. Wishing to show him his error, he persuaded Mahātissa, by his iddhi 
  power, to create a pond, and in the pond a lotus, which a young girl was 
  picking. At the sight of the girl, Mahātissa was possessed by lust, and 
  realized that he was no arahant. Dhammadinna withdrew, and that same day 
  Mahātissa put forth effort and attained arahantship. AA.i.25.<hr><b>16. Mahātissa.</b> An incumbent of Cittalapabbata. 
  He was troubled by lustful thoughts and consulted his teacher. The Thera asked 
  him to prepare a cell for him, which he did with great care. The Thera then 
  asked him to occupy it for one night, since he had taken so much trouble over 
  it. That night Mahātissa put forth effort and became an arahant. AA.i.26.<hr>
