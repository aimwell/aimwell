<hr>
<p><b>1. Sudhammā. </b>An aggasāvikā of Atthadassī Buddha. 
Bu.xv.20; J.i.39.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sudhammā.</b> The queen consort of Renu, king of 
Uttarapañcāla. See the Somanassa Jātaka. She is identified with Mahāmāyā. 
J.i.453.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sudhammā.</b> One of the four wives of Magha. When 
Magha and his companions were building a rest house for travellers, they did not 
wish women to have any share in the work. But Sudhammā bribed the carpenter, who 
made a pinnacle of seasoned wood for the building and laid it aside with the 
words: “Sudhammā nāma ayam sālā.” When the time for the erection of the pinnacle 
came, he told Magha and the others that it was impossible to make a pinnacle 
then, as it must be of well seasoned wood. A search was started for a seasoned 
pinnacle. Sudhammā agreed to give hers if she were allowed a share in the 
building. The men were at first unwilling, but in the end gave their consent.</p>
<p>After death, Sudhammā, was born in Tāvatimsa, and, because 
of her merit in the past, there came into being for her Sudhammā, the Moot Hall 
of the Devas, nine hundred leagues in extent (DhA.i.269f., 274f.; J.i.201f). 
There the Devas hold their meetings on the eighth day of each month, or when the 
Dhamma is preached, and also all their important festivals and gatherings (See, 
e.g., D.ii.268; M.ii.79; S.i.221; J.vi.97, 126; Thag.vs.1198). All Buddhas 
preach the Abhidhamma in the Sudhammā-hall. It is said (ThagA.ii.185) that every 
devaloka has a Sudhammā-sabhā; this title is often used in comparisons to denote 
a fine hall.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sudhammā.</b> The sixth daughter of Kiki, king of 
Benares. She is identified sometimes with Mahāmāyā (E.g., J.vi.481) and 
sometimes with Dhammadinnā. E.g., Ap.ii.546, 548; ThigA.104, 114.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sudhammā Therī.</b> An arahant. She lived in the 
time of Kassapa Buddha. At the Buddha’s wish, she took a branch of the Bodhi 
tree with her and planted it in the Mahāsāgaruyyāna in Ceylon. Dpv.xvii.19f.; 
Mhv.xv.147f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sudhammā.</b> A class of Devas belonging to the 
Tāvatimsa devanikāya. VvA.258.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sudhammā. </b>Mother of Sobhita Buddha. Bu.vii.16; 
J.i.35.</p>
