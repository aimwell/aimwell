<p>Wife of King Vankanāsikatissa. She was the daughter of 
King Subha, and was given to a friend of his, a brick worker, who adopted her as 
his daughter. She used to bring him food at midday. One day, seeing an ascetic 
in a kadamba thicket, she gave him the food. The brick worker was glad, and 
asked her to give food regularly to the monk, who prophesied that she would be 
the queen, and asked her not to forget the kadamba thicket. She had auspicious 
signs on her body, on account of which she was chosen to be the wife of 
Vankanāsika. She later remembered the thera’s words and built a vihāra on the 
site of the kadamba thicket. Mhv.xxxv.101ff.</p>
