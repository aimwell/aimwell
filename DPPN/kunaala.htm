<p><b>1. Kunāla.</b>-One of the seven great lakes 
in the region of the Himālaya. The Buddha once visited it with a large concourse 
of Sākiyan youths who had joined the Order, and on that occasion he preached the 
<a href="kunaala_jat_536.htm" title="ku/kunaala_jat_536.htm">Kunāla Jātaka</a> (J.v.415; MA.ii.692, 1021; AA.ii.759, etc.). 
The sun’s rays never reached the waters of the lake, which were therefore never 
warm (SnA.ii.407). According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.358; 
DA.ii.675), the Kunāla Jātaka was actually preached on the 
banks of the Kunāladaha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Kunāla.</b>-The Bodhisatta, born as the 
king of the Citrakokilas. He lived in a beautiful forest in the Himālaya, 
attended by three thousand five hundred hen birds. He was carried about on a 
stick by two birds while in front, behind, above and below flew his vast 
retinue, guarding him from all harm and providing for all his needs. He 
distrusted and despised all womankind, and his stories of their wiles, as 
related by him to his friend <a href="punnamukha.htm" title="pu/punnamukha.htm">Punnamukha</a>, are given in the 
<a href="kunaala_jat_536.htm" title="ku/kunaala_jat_536.htm">Kunāla Jātaka</a>.</p>
