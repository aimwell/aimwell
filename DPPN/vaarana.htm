<p>A Thera. He was born in a brahmin family of Kosala, and 
having heard a forest dwelling monk preach, entered the Order. One day, when on 
his way to visit the Buddha, he saw a fight between snakes and mongooses, in 
which many of them perished. Distressed by the sight of their hatred for each 
other, he sought the help of the Buddha, who preached to him three stanzas 
(Thag.237-9). At the end of the recitation, Vārana developed insight and became 
an arahant. </p>
<p>Ninety two kappas ago he was born in the family of the 
brahmin Sumedha, and becoming expert in brahmin lore, he entered the ascetic 
life. As he sat teaching hymns to his pupils there was an earthquake, marking 
the conception of Tissa Buddha. People, in terror, sought the sage, who 
explained it to them, thereby himself experiencing great joy in contemplating 
the glory of the Buddha (ThagA.i.353f). </p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Nimittivyākaranīya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.411f.</p>
