<p>King of <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> and father of 
<a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a>. </p>
<p>He was the son of Candagutta and reigned for twenty eight 
years. He had one hundred sons — the eldest being 
Sumana — ninety nine of whom were killed by 
Asoka (Mhv.v.18 f., 38f.; Dpv.v.101; vi.15; some accounts, e.g., MT.324, say he 
had one hundred and one sons). </p>
<p>Bindusāra patronised the brahmins and provided constant 
meals for sixty thousand brahmins of various sects (Sp.i.44). </p>
<p>His mother was Candagutta’s maternal cousin and chief 
queen. One day, while Bindusāra was yet unborn, she was eating with Candagutta 
and he fed her with some food prepared for himself. The food contained poison, 
placed there by the orders of Candagutta’s minister, Cānakka, that the king 
might gradually be made immune from poison. Cānakka entered as she was about to 
swallow the food, and, anxious to save the unborn child, he cut off the queen’s 
head with a sword before the food could travel down into her stomach, opened her 
womb, removed the child, and placed it in the womb of a freshly slaughtered 
goat. For seven days the child lay in the womb of a 
goat, each day a fresh one, until, at the end of these seven days, the child was 
ready for birth. Because of this, Bindusāra’s body was spotted in various places 
from the blood of the goats, and from this he obtained his name (MT.187f).
</p>
<p>Bindusāra’s chief queen was <a href="dhammaa.htm" title="d/dhammaa.htm">Dhammā</a> of the Moriya 
clan. She bore two sons, Asoka and Tissa (MT.189, 324). Bindusāra had to kill 
the Yakkha Devagabbha (q.v.) before he could ascend the throne (MT.188).</p>
