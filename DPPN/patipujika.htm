<p>A woman of Sāvatthi, who once had belonged to the retinue 
of the god Mālābhārī, and passed out of her deva existence while sitting on the 
branch of a tree picking flowers for him. She remembered her former existence, 
and yearned to rejoin Mālābhārī even after she was married, hence her name. With 
this object in view she did many good deeds, and is said to have developed 
simultaneously the fifty six qualities of goodness.  </p>
<p>She gave birth to four sons, 
and dying one day of a sudden illness, was reborn into the retinue of Mālābhāri.
She was greatly agitated on hearing her story and 
realizing how short is the span of human life. DhA.i.363ff.</p>
