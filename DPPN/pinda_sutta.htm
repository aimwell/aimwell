<p>Once the Buddha was at Pañcasālā when the day came for all 
young people to send gifts to each other. The Buddha went to the village for 
alms, but the villagers, influenced by Māra, gave him nothing, and he returned 
with his empty bowl. Māra tried to influence the Buddha to go a second time, but 
this he refused to do (S.i.113; the incident is also found at DhA.iii., p. 
257f). The Commentary says (SA.i.141) that Māra did not want the Buddha to 
accept the gifts of the maidens and to preach to them, because then they would 
pass beyond his evil influence.</p>
