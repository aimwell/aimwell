<p>1. Upavāna.-A thera. He belonged to a 
very rich brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and having seen the Buddha’s majesty at 
the dedication of Jetavana, he entered the Order and became an arahant with 
sixfold aññā. For some time, before Ānanda was appointed upatthāka, Upavāna 
waited on the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was attacked by cramp, Upavāna, with 
the help of his lay-friend Devahita, obtained hot water and suitable medicines, 
with which the ailment was healed; the Buddha, thereupon, expressed his 
gratitude. ThagA.i.308ff; this ailment does not seem to be mentioned in Milinda 
134f. where several others are given. This incident is given at greater length 
in S.i.174f; see also DhA.iv.232f.</p>
<p>When the Buddha lay on his death-bed at 
Kusināra, Upavāna was by his side fanning him; the Buddha, seeing that he 
obstructed the vision of the devas who had come to pay their last homage to the 
Teacher, asked Upavāna to move away (D.ii.138f).</p>
<p>Two occasions are mentioned on which 
Upavāna consulted the Buddha on matters of doctrine, once regarding the arising 
of suffering (S.ii.41-2) and once on the immediate and practical use of the 
Dhamma (sanditthikadhamma) (S.iv.41). There is also recorded a visit of Upavāna 
to Sāriputta when they were both staying in the Ghositārāma at Kosambī. 
Sāriputta asks him about the bojjhangas as being conducive to a happy life and 
Upavāna explains (S.v.76). On another occasion Upavāna is the enquirer, and he 
asks Sāriputta about the “end-maker” (antakara); Sāriputta explains that the 
“end-maker” is the one who knows and sees things as they really are (A.ii.163).</p>
<p>When an unpleasant interview took place 
between Sāriputta and Lāludāyī (q.v.) and no one was found to support Sāriputta, 
the matter is reported to the Buddha, who declares that Ānanda should have taken 
Sāriputta’s side. Soon afterwards Ānanda seeks Upavāna and tells him that he was 
too timid to interfere, and if the Buddha referred to the matter again, would 
Upavāna undertake to answer? In the evening the Buddha engages Upavāna in 
conversation and asks him to explain the five qualities which make a monk 
esteemed and loved by his colleagues. At the end of the discourse the Buddha 
applauds Upavāna (A.iii.195f).</p>
<p>In Padumuttara’s time Upavāna had been a 
poor man. Seeing people making great offerings at the Buddha’s Thūpa, he was 
much touched, and having washed his upper garment, he hung it as a flag over the 
Thūpa. A yakkha named Abhisammataka, who was the guardian of the cetiya, took 
the flag three times round the cetiya, he himself remaining invisible.</p>
<p>A monk whom the man consulted after this 
miracle foretold that for thirty thousand kappas he would be in the deva-worlds 
and that he would be deva-king eighty times. One thousand times he was 
Cakkavatti. In his last life his wealth was eighty crores. When he was 
Cakkavatti, his banner was held aloft, three leagues in height. Ap.i.70ff.</p>
