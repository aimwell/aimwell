  <h2>Takkāriya Jātaka (v.l. Takkārika) (No.481)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Brahmadatta had, as chaplain, a 
tawny-brown brahmin who was toothless, and whose wife had a paramour possessed 
of the same attributes. Wishing for the death of the latter, the chaplain asked 
the king to build anew the southern gate of his city, and declared that on the 
day the gate was set up a tawny-brown brahmin should be killed and sacrificed to 
the guardian spirits. The king agreed, but the chaplain, unable to restrain his 
wife’s conduct, told her about it. The news spread abroad, and all tawny-brown 
brahmins fled from the city, leaving, on the auspicious day, only the chaplain. 
The people demanded that he should be slain to avert ill-luck, and that his 
pupil, Takkāriya (the Bodhisatta), should be appointed in his place. The 
chaplain confessed his plan to Takkāriya, who thereupon related several stories 
showing how “silence is golden.” In the end Takkāriya allowed the chaplain to 
flee from the city, and had the corpse of a goat buried under the city gates in 
the dead of night (J.iv.242ff).</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Kokālika, who came to grief by abusing the Chief Disciples. See Kokālika (2).</p>
<p>The tawny-brown brahmin is identified 
with Kokālika.</p>
<p>The Jātaka seems also to have been 
called the Takka Jātaka (E.g., J.v.446) and the Mahātakkāri Jātaka. J.ii.175.</p>
