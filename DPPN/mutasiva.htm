<p>King of Ceylon, senior contemporary of Asoka. He was the 
son of Pandukābhaya and Suvannapālī, and reigned for sixty years (307<span lang="en-us">-247 
B.C.). Among his works was the laying out of the Mahāmeghavana. He had ten sons 
and two daughters, and was succeeded by his second son, Devānampiyatissa 
(Mhv.xi.1ff.; xiii.2). For their names see Dpv.xi.5 and xvii.25f., also MT. 425: 
Abhaya, Tissa (Devānampiyatissa), Nāga (Mahānāga), Uttiya, Mattābhayā, Mitta, 
Sīva (Mahā-Sīva), Asela, Tissa, (Sūratissa), Kīra, Anulā and Sīvalī.</p>
<p>The Dīpavamsa (v. 82; but see xi.13) says that the sixth 
year of Asoka’s reign corresponded with the forty eighth of Mutasīva’s. Mutasīva, 
was crowned in the fourteenth year of Candagutta’s reign and was still alive 
when the Third Council was held, when Mahinda was entrusted with the conversion 
of Ceylon; but Mahinda waited for the death of Mutasīva before carrying out his 
mission. Mhv.xi.12.</p>
