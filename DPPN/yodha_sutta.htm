<p><b>1. Yodha Sutta.</b> Three qualities which make a 
soldier serviceable to a king: he must be a long distance shot, a rapid (like 
lightning) shot, and a piercer of huge objects; and three similar qualities 
(details of which are given) which make a monk worthy of homage and gifts. 
A.i.284f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Yodha Sutta.</b> Similar to (1), but four qualities 
are given, the fourth being that the soldier must be skilled in the knowledge of 
points of vantage. A.ii.170f.</p>
