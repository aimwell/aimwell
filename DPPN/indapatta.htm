<p>A town in the Kuru country. In the 
<a href="kurudhamma_jat_276.htm" title="ku/kurudhamma_jat_276.htm">Kurudhamma Jātaka</a> (J.ii.365f; also J.iii.400; iv.361; v.457; vi.255; Cyp.i.3, 
v.1), <a href="dhananjaya.htm#Koravya" title="d/dhananjaya.htm#Koravya">Dhanañjaya Koravya</a>, is mentioned as its king and as the owner of Añjanavasabha, the elephant of wondrous power. </p>
<p>The town was seven leagues in extent 
(J.v.57; 484) and there was a road that ran straight from Indapatta to Bārānasī 
(J.v.59). </p>
<p>In times past, Indapatta was considered 
one of the three chief cities of <a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>, the others being
<a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a> and 
Kekaka (J.ii.213, 214). </p>
<p>According to a verse found at the end of 
the <a href="buddhavamsa.htm" title="b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> (Bu.xxviii.11), the Buddha’s razor and needle were enshrined at 
Indapatta.</p>
<p>The modern Delhi stands on the site of 
Indapatta.</p>
