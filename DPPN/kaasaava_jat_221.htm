<p>A poor man of Benares, having entered 
into a contract with ivory workers to supply elephants' tusks, went into the 
forest clad in a Pacceka Buddha’s yellow robe, and standing in the path of the 
elephants, slew the last one of the herd each day. The Bodhisatta, being the 
leader of the elephants, on discovering what was happening, threatened to kill 
the man; but receiving his promise never to visit the forest again, he let him 
go free on account of his robe.</p>
<p>A trader, coming to Rājagaha on 
business, contributed a magnificent yellow robe to an almsgiving organised by 
the townspeople. There was some dispute as to whether Sāriputta or Devadatta 
should receive the robe; but the majority favouring Devadatta, he cut the robe 
into strips and wore it in great style. When the matter was reported to the 
Buddha, he related the above Jātaka story, in which Devadatta is identified with 
the huntsman. J.ii.196ff</p>
