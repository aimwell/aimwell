<p><b>1. Bhaggava. </b>A teacher to whom the Buddha went 
  after leaving <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, and before seeking
<a href="aalara_kaalaama.htm" title="aa/aalara_kaalaama.htm">Alāra</a> and 
<a href="uddaka_raamaputta.htm" title="u/uddaka_raamaputta.htm">Uddaka</a>. ThigA., p. 2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhaggava.</b> Father of 
<a href="angulimaala.htm" title="ay/angulimaala.htm">Angulimāla</a> and chaplain 
  of the king of Kosala. Bhaggava was a brahmin. Thag.A.ii.57.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhaggava. </b>A potter in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> in whose dwelling the Buddha met and 
conversed with <a href="pukkusati.htm" title="pu/pukkusati.htm">Pukkusāti</a> (M.iii.237). </p>
<p>Bhaggava seems to have been a generic name for all 
potters, perhaps a special form of address used towards members of the 
kumbhakāra “caste.” Thus we find in the books several instances of potters being 
addressed as “Bhaggava“. E.g., DhA.i.33; J.ii.80, iii.382. At J.111.382 the 
potter’s wife is addressed as “Bhaggavī.”</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.36, 60) the Buddha addresses 
Ghatīkāra Brahmā as “Bhaggava”; he had been a potter of Vehalinga in his 
previous birth and the name “Ghatīkāra” itself means “jar maker.” The 
Commentaries give no explanation of the word; perhaps the potters claimed their 
descent from Bhrgu. </p>
<p>Bhaggava is sometimes given as an example of a gotta. 
E.g., Sp.i.160 (with Gotama). </p>
