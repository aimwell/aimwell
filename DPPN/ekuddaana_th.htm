<p>An arahant. He was the son of a wealthy 
brahmin of Sāvatthi, and being convinced of the Buddha’s majesty, as seen at the 
presentation of the Jetavana, he entered the Order. He dwelt in the forest 
fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him. The 
Buddha, seeing Sāriputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that 
to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 
259). The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon 
reflected on it. He thus came to be called Ekuddāniya. One day he obtained 
insight and became an arahant. Later, when Ānanda asked him to preach a sermon, 
it was this stanza that he took as his text.</p>
<p>We are told that in the time of 
Atthadassī Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he 
went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities. A disciple 
of the Buddha, named Sāgara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the 
Buddha’s thūpa. In Kassapa’s time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha 
utter the stanza mentioned above. He entered the Order, and for twenty thousand 
years practised meditation, repeating the stanza, but gained no attainment 
(ThagA.i.153f; Thag.v.68).</p>
<p>It is said (DhA.iii.384f) that on 
fast-days Ekuddāna, alone in the forest, sounded the call for the deities of the 
forest to attend the preaching of the Law, and uttered his stanza, whereupon the 
deities made loud applause. One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, 
visited Ekuddāna with a retinue of five hundred each. Seeing them, Ekuddāna’s 
heart was glad and he said: “Today we will listen to the Law.” On being asked 
for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest 
grove was filled with the applause of devas. Thereupon one of the Elders recited 
the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound. In order to 
dispel their doubts, Ekuddāna took his seat and pronounced his one stanza. The 
sound of the plaudits of the devas filled the forest. The Elders were greatly 
offended at the conduct of the devas and complained to the Buddha. The Buddha 
explained to them that the important thing was not the amount of knowledge but 
the quality of the understanding.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the verse, 
attributed above to Ekuddāniya, occurs in the Vinaya (Vin.iv.54) as having been 
constantly used by Cūlapanthaka. Whenever it was his turn to preach to the nuns 
at Sāvatthi they expected no effective lesson, since he always repeated the same 
stanza, namely, that which is above attributed to Ekuddāniya. The thera, bearing 
of their remarks, forthwith gives an exhibition of his iddhi-power and of his 
knowledge of the Dhamma, thereby winning their tribute of admiration.</p>
