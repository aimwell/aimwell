<hr>
<p><b>1. Cakkhu Sutta</b>.-Preached to Rāhula at 
Jetavana. The Buddha shows him how the eye and all the other senses are fleeting 
and lead to unhappiness. The well-taught disciple should, therefore, be repelled 
by the senses. S.ii.244, also 249.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Cakkhu Sutta</b>.-The eye and all the 
other senses are impermanent. He who has faith in these doctrines, or has seen 
them moderately with his insight, is assured of perfection; he who has realised 
them is a stream-winner, bound for enlightenment. S.ii.225.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Cakkhu Sutta</b>.-In the arising and the 
rebirth of the eye lies the origin of suffering, disease, decay and death; so 
also with the other senses. The cessation of these states is brought about by 
the cessation in the birth of the senses. S.iii.228.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Cakkhu Sutta</b>.-The desire and lust 
arising in the eye and in the other senses mean corruption of the heart. By 
putting away such corruption can the truth be realised. S.iii.232.</p>
