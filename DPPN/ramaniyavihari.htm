<p>An arahant. He was the son of a banker of Rājagaha and lived a dissolute 
life, till one day, on witnessing the arrest of an adulterer, he was very 
agitated and joined the Order. As a monk, too, he lived in luxury, in a well 
furnished room hence his name. Later, seized with remorse, he wandered out of 
his cell. On the way he saw a carter refresh a weary bull and then re-yoke him. 
Determined to take up his duties as a monk, he sought Upāli, and, with his help, 
attained arahantship. In the past he had offered koranda flowers to Vipassī 
Buddlha (Thag.vs.45; ThagA.i.115f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Korandapupphiya Thera of the Apadāna. Fifty 
seven kappas ago he was a king named Vītamala. Ap.i.206.</p>
