<p><b>1. Vutthi Sutta.</b> A conversation between two devas 
and the Buddha’s comments thereon. Of things making for progress, knowledge is 
the best; ignorance is the greatest worsener; among beings that walk, the Sangha 
is the best; among declarants, the Buddha is the best. S.i.42.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vutthi Sutta.</b> At the end of the rains, Sāriputta 
takes leave of the Buddha to go into the country. As he is about to start, a 
monk reports to the Buddha that Sāriputta has offended him and has not asked his 
pardon. (The Commentary (AA.ii.797) explains that the skirt of Sāriputta’s robe 
brushed the Elder; some say the wind blew it without his knowledge.) Sāriputta 
is sent for and asked to explain; he declares with a wealth of simile that he is 
free from hatred and ill will; he has nothing but loathing for his body; how 
then would he offend a brother monk and not ask his pardon? The accuser is 
convinced of his folly and begs forgiveness. (A.iv.373ff.; cf. DhA.ii.178ff., 
where the story recurs.)</p>
