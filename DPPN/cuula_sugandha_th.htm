<p>An arahant. In the time of Kassapa 
Buddha he belonged to a very rich family in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, and having heard the Buddha 
preach covered the Buddha’s Gandhakuti eight times with the four kinds of 
fragrant stuff (catujātiyagandha). In this age he was born in Sāvatthi. While he 
was yet in his mother’s womb the perfume of sandalwood spread from her body and 
on the day of his birth it filled the whole city; so it was also on the day of 
his ordination and on that of his death. He entered the Order on seeing the 
Buddha convert Sela and his followers (Ap.ii.508ff). He is probably identical 
with Subhūti Thera (ThagA.i.405). His legend seems to have become confused with 
that of Sugandha. See Ap.ii.459 and ThagA.i.80f.</p>
