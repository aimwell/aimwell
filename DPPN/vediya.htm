<p>A mountain to the north of <a href="ambasandaa.htm" title="am/ambasandaa.htm">Ambasandā</a>, in which was the 
<a href="indasaalaguhaa.htm" title="i_/indasaalaguhaa.htm">Indasālaguhā</a>, where the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> stayed. The mountain was bathed in radiance when 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> visited the Buddha on the occasion of the preaching of the 
<a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a> (D.ii.263, 264).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (DA.iii.697) that the mountain was so 
called because its base was covered with a forest belt, which looked like a 
jewel railing (manivedikā).</p>
<p>On the mountain lived an owl, who would accompany 
the Buddha half way to the village when he went for alms, and return with him. 
One day the owl stood with lowered wings, its claws clasped together. The Buddha 
smiled when he saw it, and, in reply to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda’s</a> question, said that the owl, 
after spending one hundred thousand kappas among gods and men, would become a 
Pacceka Buddha named <a href="somanassa.htm" title="s/somanassa.htm">Somanassa</a>.  </p>
<p>MA.i.255 f; cp. KhpA.151, where the mountain is 
called Vedisaka.</p>
