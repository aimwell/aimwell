<p>King of Kumbhavatī in Kalinga (M.i.378; 
MA.ii.599ff; J.iii.463; v.133ff; 267; Mtu.iii.363ff).  </p>
<p><a href="kisa_vaccha.htm" title="ku/kisa_vaccha.htm">Kisavaccha</a>, pupil 
of <a href="sarabhanga.htm" title="sa/sarabhanga.htm">Sarabhanga</a>, desiring solitude, lived in the royal park near the city, and was 
ill-treated by Dandakī and his army while on their way to quell a rebellion, 
they being under the impression that insult inflicted on Kisavaccha would bring 
them luck.  </p>
<p>As a result the gods were greatly incensed and destroyed the king and 
his country, only three people escaping death: Kisavaccha, the 
commander-in-chief, who was a pious follower of Kisavaccha, and a man named Rāma, 
who had come from <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> to Kumbhavati. The last named was saved from 
destruction owing to his care for his parents. The forest which grew on the 
desolate land came to be called <a href="dandakaaranna.htm" title="d/dandakaaranna.htm">Dandakārañña</a>.</p>
