  <h2>Dhammasangani</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first book, in the accepted order of 
precedence, of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It deals with more or less the same topics 
as the Nikāyas, differing only in methods of treatment; the chief subject is 
that of ethics, the enquiry thereinto being conducted from a psychological 
standpoint. The book enumerates and defines a number of categories of terms 
occurring in the Nikāyas. </p>
<p>There is in existence a commentary on 
the book, written by Buddhaghosa and called the Atthasālinī. King Vijayabāhu I, 
of Ceylon translated the Dhammasangani into Sinhalese (Cv.lx.17), but this 
translation is now lost. The work has been translated into English. The text is 
published by the P.T.S. (1885), and the translation (by Mrs. Rhys Davids) is 
published by the R.A.S., under the title of A Buddhist Manual of Psychological 
Ethics.</p>
<p>The Dhammasangani appears to have been 
also called Dhammasangaha (DA.i.17).</p>
