<p>A brahmin of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> who — incensed 
that his eldest brother, a member of the <a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja</a> clan and, probably its head, 
(KS.i.201, n. 4; see also Dhānañjānī) had been converted by the Buddha — visits 
the Buddha and insults him. </p>
<p>Later he is himself converted and 
becomes an arahant (S.i.161f.; MA.i.808). </p>
<p>The soubriquet of Akkosaka was given him 
by the Sangītikārā to distinguish him as the author of a lampoon of 500 verses 
against the Buddha (SA.i.177). </p>
<p><a href="asurindaka_bh.htm" title="ay/asurindaka_bh.htm">Asurindaka-Bhāradvāja</a> was his younger 
brother (SA.i.178); he had two others, <a href="sundarika_bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="s/sundarika_bhaaradvaaja.htm">Sundarī Bhāradvāja</a> and 
<a href="bilangika.htm" title="b/bilangika.htm">Bilangika-Bhāradvāja</a>, who also became converts and, later, arahants. DhA.iv.163.</p>
