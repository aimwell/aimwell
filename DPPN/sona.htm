<hr>
<p><b>1. Sona Thera. </b>Aggasāvaka of Vessabhū Buddha. He 
was the Buddha’s younger brother, and the Buddha’s first sermon was preached to 
him. J.i.42; Bu.xxii.23; BuA.205; D.ii.4.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sona Thera. </b>The enemy and rival of Piyadassī 
Buddha, corresponding to Devadatta. He conspired with Mahāpaduma to kill the 
Buddha, but was unsuccessful. BuA.174f.; for details see Piyadassī.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sona.</b> A fierce horse belonging to the king of 
Benares; he was also called Mahāsona. See the Suhanu Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sona-<a name="Kutikanna">Kutikanna</a>, Sona-Kotikanna.</b> A Thera, 
declared chief&nbsp;- of those possessing clear utterance (A.i.24). He was 
the son of <a href="kaalii.htm" title="ka/kaalii.htm">Kālī Kuraragharikā</a>, and was conceived before the Buddha appeared in 
the world. (According to ThagA.i.429, his father was a rich setthi; no mention 
is made there of his mother).  </p>
<p>A little while before the birth of the child Kālī 
went to her parents' house in Rājagaha, and one day, as she was cooling herself, 
she heard a conversation between two Yakkhas, <a href="satagira.htm" title="sa/satagira.htm">Sātāgira</a> and 
<a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a>. As she 
listened to their talk, her mind was filled with thoughts of the virtues of the 
Buddha, and she became a sotāpanna. That same night the child was born and was 
called Sona. His mother later returned to <a href="kuraraghara.htm" title="ku/kuraraghara.htm">Kuraraghara</a>. At that time 
<a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> 
lived near by and often visited her home. Sona was very attached to him, and was 
later ordained by him. Three years later he received the upasampadā, and, with 
Mahā Kaccāna’s leave, visited the, Buddha. Kālī gave him a large carpet to 
spread in the Buddha’s <a href="gandhakuti.htm" title="g/gandhakuti.htm">Gandhakuti</a>.</p>
<p>When Sona arrived at the Gandhakuti, he worshipped the 
Buddha, who asked <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> to find him a lodging. Ānanda, reading the Buddha’s 
thoughts, spread a rug in the Buddha’s chamber. Late at night Sona went to bed, 
and, very early the next morning, the Buddha woke him and asked him to recite 
the Dhamma. Sona recited the whole of the <a href="atthaka_s_v.htm" title="ay/atthaka_s_v.htm">Atthakavagga</a>, which he had learnt from 
Mahā Kaccāna. At the end of the recital the Buddha applauded him and gave him a 
boon. Sona asked for the “Vinaya-dharapañcamaganena upasampadā, which Kaccāna 
had asked him to choose. (This means permission to admit a monk into the Order 
with a chapter of only five monks, one of whom was versed in the Vinaya. For 
details of Sona’s visit to the Buddha, see Vin.i.194ff.; cf. Ud.v.6). Later he 
returned to Kuraraghara and visited his mother’s house. She had heard of the 
Buddha’s applause from the devas, and wished Sona to recite the Dhamma just as 
he had done before the Buddha, and this he did.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sona had resolved to win 
this eminence. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a member of the Order and 
sewed a robe for a monk. Later he was a tailor of Benares and mended a Pacceka 
Buddha’s robe (Thag.vss.365-9; AA.i.133f.; ThagA.i.429).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary says (DhA.iv.103f) that, on the 
day when Sona recited the Dhamma in Kuraraghara, Kālī went to listen to him, 
leaving only one female slave in the house. Her house had seven walls and 
fortified gates and savage dogs on leash. Molten lead flowed round the walls at 
night, and in the night it proved a slippery surface, difficult to walk on. Nine 
hundred thieves had been awaiting a chance of breaking into the house, and this 
day they saw their opportunity. They stationed one of their number to watch Kālī 
going to the monastery, and to kill her if she started homewards after the 
thieves entered her house. When they came her female servant ran to the 
monastery to tell her about it. But she would not be disturbed and sent her 
back. Again the servant went, and again she was sent back. When the thief, 
stationed near Kālī, saw her extraordinary piety, he was filled with remorse, 
and, at the end of the sermon, begged her forgiveness. All the nine hundred 
thieves joined the Order under Sona Kutikanna, and on the day they became 
arahants the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of light to encourage them.</p>
<p>According to the Udāna Commentary (UdA.307), Sona was 
called Kutikanna because he wore ear ornaments worth one crore (koti). It is 
said that he once went with a caravan to <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjeni</a>, and when the caravan stopped 
for the night he slept away from the rest of its members. The caravan started 
very early and nobody waked Sona. When he finally awoke, he ran along the road 
till he came to a large tree. There he saw an ugly man tearing off his own flesh 
and eating it. On enquiry, Sona learnt that he had been a wicked merchant of 
Bhārukaccha, who had been born as a peta because he had deceived his patrons. 
This revelation filled Sona with great misgivings, which were increased by the 
sight of two peta boys with blood pouring out of their lips. They had been 
youths, also of Bhārukaccha, who had found fault with their mother for feeding 
an arahant monk. When Sona returned from Ujjeni he consulted Mahā Kaccāna about 
these things, and resolved to enter the Order.</p>
<p>The Vinaya says (Vin.i.195f) that when Kaccāna wished to 
confer the higher ordination on Sona, it was three years before he could get 
together the necessary chapter of ten monks. This was because there were but few 
monks in <a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a> and in the Southern Country; hence Sona’s request to the Buddha 
that he should allow five monks to officiate in Avanti. Other boons asked for by 
Sona and allowed by the Buddha were:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) Permission to use, in Avanti, shoes 
with thick linings, because the soil of Avanti was black and always muddy; 
  </li>
  <li>(2) permission to bath constantly; </li>
  <li>(3) to use skins for coverlets; </li>
  <li>(4) to accept robes set apart for absent monks even 
  after the lapse of ten days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sona is evidently identical with Pātihīrasaññaka of the 
Apadāna (Ap.ii.392). Gosāla Thera was a friend of Sona Kutikanna. ThagA.i.79.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="5">5</a>. Sona-Kolivisa Thera</b>, 
also called <b>Sukhumāla Sona</b> (AA.ii.679).&nbsp; He was born in 
<a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, his 
father being Usabhasetthi. From the time of his conception his father’s wealth 
continued to increase, and, on the day of his birth, the whole town kept 
festival. Because in a previous birth he had given a ring, worth one hundred 
thousand, to a Pacceka Buddha, his body was like burnished gold — hence his 
name. (He was evidently called Kolivisa because he was a Koliyan, Ap.i.95, 21). 
His hands and feet were soft like bandhujīvaka-flowers, and a fine down grew on 
them (four inches long on his feet, Ap.i.298) curved “like ear ornaments.” He 
lived in great luxury in three palaces, each having its own season.</p>
<p>King <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>, hearing of him, sent for him and Sona went 
with eighty thousand fellow townsmen. </p>
<p>In Rājagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning 
faith, entered the Order with his parents' consent. The Buddha gave him a 
subject for meditation, and he went to Sītavana, but many people visited him and 
he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in 
meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and 
was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and visited him, and by preaching 
to him the Vīnūpamovāda Sutta (see Sona Sutta), taught him how to temper energy 
with calm. Thus corrected, he put forth fresh effort and attained arahantship 
(Thag.vss.632).</p>
<p>The Vinaya (i.179ff) gives details of Sona’s visit to 
Bimbisāra. The king, being curious to see Sona’s feet, sent for him. He and his 
eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly 
impressed by the iddhi-power of Sāgata. Sona then sought the Buddha alone and 
joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, 
and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” 
After Sona attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes 
with one lining. Sona said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a 
retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries 
which his colleagues did not share, The Buddha then gave permission to all monks 
to wear shoes with one lining.</p>
<p>In the time of Anomadassī Buddha he was a very rich 
setthi, and, having gone with others to the vihāra and heard the Buddha preach, 
he decorated a cankamana for the Buddha and a long hall (dīghasālā) for the 
monks. On the cankamana he scattered various flowers, and, above it, he hung 
canopies. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a setthi of Hamsavatī named 
Sirivaddha. It was then that he resolved to win eminence as foremost of those 
who strove energetically (aggam āraddhaviriyānan), and in this he was successful 
(A.i.24). After the death of Kassapa Buddha Sona was a householder in Benares, 
and built a hut by the river for a Pacceka Buddha, whom he looked after during 
the rainy season. He was king of the gods for twenty five kappas, and 
seventy-seven times king among men under the name of Yasodhara. ThagA.i.544f.; 
cf. Ap.i.93f., where he is called Koliyavessa. The ApA. confused his story with 
that of Kutikanna; see also AA.i.130f., where the details are different, 
especially regarding the honour paid by Sona to the Pacceka Buddha. Once, on 
visiting the Pacceka Buddha’s cell, he noticed that the ground outside it was 
muddy; so he spread on the ground a rug worth one hundred thousand, so that the 
Pacceka Buddha’s feet might not be soiled.</p>
<p>The Apadāna mentions (Ap.i.298) a Thera, called Sona 
Kotivīsa, evidently identical with the above, the reason given for the name 
being that he gave away wealth equal in value to twenty crores (vīsa koti). His 
eminence is ascribed to the fact that, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he made a 
lena (cave) for the Buddha and his monks and spread it with rugs. Buddhaghosa 
(AA.i.130) gives a variant of his name, calling him Kotivessa, and explains this 
by saying that he belonged to a vessa (merchant) family worth a crore.</p>
<p>The Sona Sutta (Cf. AA.ii.680, where he is described as 
gandhabbasippe cheko) mentions that Sona was a clever player of the vīnā before 
he joined the Order. It was the example of Sona Kolivisa which urged Nandaka and 
his brother, Bharata, to leave the world. ThagA.i.299.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sona. </b>An arahant monk who was sent with Uttara 
to convert Suvannabhūmi. Dpv.viii.12; Sp.i.68, 69; Mhv.xii.6, 44ff.; for details 
see Suvannabhūmi.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sona. </b>A minister of Mahāsena and a follower of 
the heretic monk, Sanghamitta. He helped Sanghamitta in the despoliation of the 
Lohapāsāda and other buildings. He was killed in an attempt to destroy the 
Thūpārāma (Mhv.xxxvii.10, 13, 28). In the Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xxii.70, 71) he is 
called Pāpasona.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Sona.</b> See Mahāsona.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Sona-Potirīyaputta</b> (or Setthiputta) Thera. He 
was born in Kapilavatthu as the son of the zemindar Potirīya (Selissariya), and 
became chief of the forces of the Sākyan Bhaddiya. When Bhaddiya left the world, 
Sona followed his example and entered the Order. But he was lazy and not given 
to meditation. The Buddha saw this from the Ambavana at Anupiyā and, sending 
forth a ray of glory, spurred him on. Sona became agitated, and putting forth 
effort became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a forester and gave the 
Buddha a kuruñjiya-fruit (Thag.vss.193, 194; ThagA.i.316f). He is probably 
identical with Kuruñjiyaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.448f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Sona. </b>A gahapatiputta of Rājagaha. He is 
mentioned as having had two conversations with the. Buddha at Veluvana: one on 
the impermanence of the body, feelings, etc., their origin and their cessation 
(S.iii.48f); and, on another occasion, as to why some beings achieve complete 
cessation in this life and others do not. S.iv.113.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Sona.</b> A gifted preacher, who lived in the 
Pipphali vihāra at the foot of Sonnagiri. His father was a hunter, and all 
Sona’s efforts to lead him away from sin failed, until he was very old, when 
Sona ordained him just before his death. The old man saw the Niraya and dogs 
coming to devour him. He shouted in his fright, and Sona took him on his bed to 
the vihāra and made him worship the cetiya, the bodhi-tree, etc., and offered 
various things in his father’s name. He then saw the Devaloka 
before him. VibhA.439; cf. AA.i.255, where the vihāra is called Pañcala-vihāra, 
and MA.ii.887, where it is called Paceli-vihāra.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Sona. </b>A Thera of the Mahāvihāra, at whose 
request the Kankhāvitaranī was written. Knv., p.1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Sona. </b>See Sona and its compounds.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Sona Suttā. </b>Two suttas, recording conversations 
between the Buddha and Sona-gahapati of Rājagaha. S.iii.48f.; iv.113.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sona Sutta. </b>Sona Kolivisa, living in Sītavana, 
despairs of ever attaining arahantship. The Buddha, on Gijjhakūta, becomes aware 
of this and visits him. The Buddha reminds him that when he was a vīnā player 
his vīnā sounded neither tuneful nor playable when the strings were either 
over-strung or over-lax. Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when 
over-lax, in idleness. Sona profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant. He 
then visits the Buddha and declares to him his new found vision. A.iii.374f.</p>
