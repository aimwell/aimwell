<p>Ānanda, with great difficulty, persuades 
Mahā Kassapa to accompany him to a settlement of nuns. Mahā Kassapa goes and 
preaches to them, but Thulla-Tissā, not being pleased with the sermon, upbraids 
Mahā Kassapa for what she calls his impertinence in preaching when Ānanda is 
present. “How does the needle-pedlar deem he could sell a needle to the 
needle-maker?” Kassapa is upset, and Ānanda asks for forgiveness in the nun’s 
name, for women, he says, are foolish, and one must be indulgent to them. 
Kassapa reminds the audience that it was he himself and not Ānanda who was 
declared by the Buddha to be the Buddha’s equal in the attainment of the jhānas.
