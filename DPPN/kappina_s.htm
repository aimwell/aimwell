<p>1. Kappina Sutta.-Mahā-Kappina visits 
the Buddha who, seeing him from afar, tells the monks that Mahā-Kappina is 
highly gifted and of wondrous power, a gifted preacher and radiant; one of those 
who bad gained the object of renunciation. The Buddha proceeds to say how one, 
clothed in wisdom and virtue, is best among beings, and how the Noble One is 
best of shining objects in that he shines always (S.ii.284). The verses of this 
sutta are also quoted elsewhere. E.g., D.iii.98; Dh.vs.387.</p>
<p>2. Kappina Sutta.-The Buddha sees Mahā-Kappina 
sitting cross-legged, with body erect, and mindful. He points him out to the 
monks, telling them that he can sit thus without shaking or wavering of his body 
because he has developed concentration on breathing. S.v.315f.</p>
