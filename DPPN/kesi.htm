<p>1. Kesi.-A horse-trainer. He came to see 
the Buddha and became his follower as a result of the interview (A.ii.112f). For 
details see Kesi Sutta.</p>
<p>2. Kesi.-Buddhaghosa’s father. He lived 
in Ghosagāma. v.l. Kesa. Gv.66; Buddhaghosuppatti, p.38; Sās.29.</p>
<p>3. Kesi.-A noble steed belonging to 
Ekarāja (J.vi.135).</p>
<p>4. Kesi.-See Kesava.</p>
<p>Kesi Vagga.-The twelfth chapter of the 
Catukka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.112-21). The first sutta is that of 
Kesi, the horse-trainer, and most of the suttas deal with the idea of 
“training.” The Commentary calls it Kosiya Vagga.</p>
<p>Kesi Sutta.-The horse-trainer. Kesi 
visits the Buddlia, and in answer to a question says that he trains some horses 
by mildness, some by harshness, and others by both; those which do not submit to 
his training he destroys. The Buddha says that just so does he deal with men. 
Some he tames by mildness — telling them what is good and showing them the way 
to heaven; others by harshness — condemning the evils in them; yet others by 
both. Those who do not submit to this discipline he destroys, by refusing to 
admonish them (A.ii.112f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.120) that the 
Kesi Sutta should be one of those used to explain the term purisadamma-sārathī 
in reference to the Buddha.</p>
