<p><b>1. Ujjenī.</b>-The capital of
<a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a>. 
In the Buddha’s time, <a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Canda-Pajjota</a> (Vin.i.276; DhA.i.192) was king of Ujjenī 
and there was friendly intercourse between that city and 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, whose king was Seniya
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>. After Bimbisāra’s death, however, Pajjota seems to have 
contemplated a war against <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasathu</a>. See M.iii.7.</p>
<p>There was an old trade-route from Ujjenī 
to Benares and the merchants of the two cities showed healthy rivalry not only 
in trade, but also in matters of culture. See, e.g., J.ii.248ff., where the 
merchants of Benares compare their musician <a href="guttila.htm" title="g/guttila.htm">Guttila</a> with 
<a href="musila.htm" title="me_mu/musila.htm">Mūsila</a>, the chief 
fiddler of Ujjenī.</p>
<p>It was while going with a caravan to 
Ujjenī, that <a href="sona.htm" title="s/sona.htm">Sona Kutikanna</a> (4) met the Peta, whose 
words made him decide to renounce household life (UdA.307f).</p>
<p>The road taken by 
<a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī’s</a> disciples ran 
through <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjenī</a> (Sn.v.1011).</p>
<p>Ujjenī was also the birthplace of 
<a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā 
Kaccāna</a> (ThagA.i.483), of <a href="isidaasii_thi.htm" title="i_/isidaasii_thi.htm">Isidāsī</a> (Thig.v.405), of 
<a href="abhaya.htm" title="am/abhaya.htm">Abhaya</a> (ThagA.41) and of the 
courtesan <a href="padumavati.htm" title="pa/padumavati.htm">Padumavatī</a>, mother of 
<a href="abhayaa.htm" title="am/abhayaa.htm">Abhayā</a> (ThigA.39).</p>
<p>Before succeeding to his father’s throne 
at <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaliputta</a>, <a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a> reigned for several years as Viceroy at Ujjenī, and it was 
during this period that <a href="mahinda.htm" title="ma/mahinda.htm">Mahinda</a> and
<a href="sanghamitta_theri.htm" title="sa/sanghamitta_theri.htm">Sanghamittā</a> were born (Mhv.xiii.10ff; 
Mbv.99; Sp.i.70).</p>
<p>Mahinda spent six months in Dakkhinagiri 
Vihāra in Ujjenī, prior to his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.5).</p>
<p>From the same vihāra forty thousand 
monks were present, under the leadership of Mahā Sangharakkhita, at the 
foundation of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxix.35).</p>
<p>The Jātakas speak of Ujjenī as having 
been the capital of Avanti from very ancient times. E.g., in J.iv.390, where 
Avanti Mahārāja rules in Ujjenī as capital of Avanti. But in the Mahāgovinda 
Sutta (D.ii.235), Māhissatī is mentioned as the capital of Avanti. Perhaps 
Māhissatī lost its importance later and gave place to Ujjenī, for we find 
Māhissatī mentioned just before Ujjenī among the places passed by Bāvarī’s 
pupils on their way to Sāvatthi (Sn.v.1011).</p>
<p>Ujjenī is identical with the Greek Ozene, 
about 77° E. and 23° N. (Bud. India, p.40; see also CAGI, 560, and Beal ii.270 
for <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang’s</a> description of it).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ujjenī.</b>-A city in Ceylon, founded by Vijaya’s minister Accutagāmī (Dpv.ix.36; Mhv.vii.45).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ujjenī.</b>-A township (nigama), the 
residence of the banker’s daughter Rucinandā, who gave a meal of milk-rice to 
Padumuttara Buddha just before his Enlightenment (BuA.158).</p>
