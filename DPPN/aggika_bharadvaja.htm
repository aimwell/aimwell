<p><b>1. Aggika-Bhārādvāja.</b>-A brahmin of 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, of the 
<a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja</a> clan. The Buddha, while on his rounds, sees him 
tending the fire and preparing oblations, and stands for alms in front of his 
house. The brahmin abuses him, calling him mundaka and vasala. Thereupon the 
Buddha preaches to him the  <a href="vasala_sutta.htm" title="va/vasala_sutta.htm">Vasala Sutta</a> (or, as it is sometimes called. the Aggika Bhāradvāja Sutta), and wins him over to the faith (Sn.21-5). The 
sobriquet Aggika was given to him because he was a tender of the sacred fire. 
SnA.i.174f.</p>

<p><b>2. Aggika-Bhāradvāja.</b>-A brahmin of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, evidently different from the above, also a fire-tender. He prepares a 
meal for sacrifice, and when the Buddha, out of compassion for him, appears 
before his house for alms, he says the meal is meant only for one who has the 
“threefold lore” (the three Vedas). The Buddha gives the brahmin another 
interpretation of the “threefold lore”; (see 
<a href="aggika_sutta.htm" title="am/aggika_sutta.htm">Aggika Sutta</a>). The brahmin, 
thereupon, becomes a convert, enters the Order, and, in due course, attains 
arahantship. S.i.166f.; SA.i.179.</p>
