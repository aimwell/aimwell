  <h2>Bālapandita Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The 129th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, preached at 
Jetavana. </p>
<p>It deals with the disabilities of folly and the pain and 
anguish resulting there from, also with the advantages of wisdom and the bliss 
to which it leads. </p>
<p>It contains, besides, descriptions of the horrors of the 
hells, expressed by means of various similes (M.iii.163ff.; cp. S.ii.23f).
</p>
<p>The Sutta forms a kind of prose background to the Bāla 
Vagga and the Pandita Vagga of the Dhammapada. </p>
<p>Mahinda preached this Sutta at the Nandapavana in 
Anurādhapura, and one thousand women, who listened to him, became sotāpannas. 
Mhv.xv.4.</p>
