<p>1. Uggata.-See Ugga (4).</p>
<p>2. Uggata.-A khattiya of the city of 
Sumangala, father of Sujāta Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xiii.20.</p>
<p>3. Uggata.-The Kālinga king who, with 
Bhīmaratha, king of Sañjayantī, and Atthaka, king of Hastināpura, sought the 
Bodhisatta Sarabhanga to learn from him where the kings Kalābu, Nālikira, Ajjuna 
and Dandakī had been born after the destruction of themselves and their kingdoms 
as a result of their ill-treatment of holy men. J.v.135ff.</p>
<p>Their story is given in the Sarabhanga 
Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
<p>The scholiast of the Jātaka (J.v.137) 
takes Uggata to be not the name of the Kālinga king but a descriptive epithet, 
and explains it by saying cando viya suriyo viya ca pākato paññāto.</p>
<p>The Mahāvastu (iii.364f), however, 
definitely mentions Ugga as the name of the king, in the same way as Bhīmaratha 
and Asthamaka (Atthaka), and gives the capitals of the two latter as Sañjayantī 
and Hastināpura respectively.</p>
<p>4. Uggata.-King during the time of 
Sobhita Buddha. He built a vihāra named Surinda at Sunandavatī and another named 
Dhammaganārāma at Mekhalā and dedicated them to the Buddha and the Order. At the 
festival of dedication of the former one hundred crores became arahants and at 
that of the latter, ninety crores (Bu.vii.9f; BuA.139).</p>
<p>5. Uggata.-Twenty-nine kappas ago there 
were sixteen kings of the name of Uggata, all previous incarnations of the Thera 
Citakapūjaka. Ap.i.151.</p>
<p>6. Uggata.-King of one thousand and 
fifty-one kappas ago; a previous life of Dhajadāyaka Thera. Ap.i.109.</p>
<p>7. Uggata.-Fourteen kappas ago there 
were four kings named Uggata, previous births of Parappasādaka (Ap.i.114) or 
Bhūta (ThagA.i.494) Thera.</p>
