<p><b>2. Buddharakkhita. </b>A monk of Ceylon. He was once, 
with thirty thousand others, ministering to the Elder Mahārohanagutta of 
Therambatthala, when he saw the king of the Supannas dashing across the sky to 
seize the Nāga king who was offering rice gruel to the Elder. Buddharakkhita 
immediately created a mountain into which he made the Elder enter, thus saving 
the Nāga king. Vsm.154 f., 376.</p>
