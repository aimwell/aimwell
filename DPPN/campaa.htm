<p><b>1. Campā</b>.-A city in India on the 
river of the same name; it was the capital of Anga and was celebrated for its 
beautiful lake, the Gaggarā-pokkharanī (q.v.), which was excavated by Queen 
Gaggarā. On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance 
of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha’s time, wandering 
teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions 
(Vin.i.312; S.i.195; A.iv.59, 168; v.151, 189). Sāriputta (A.iv.59) and Vangīsa 
(S.i.195) are also said to have stayed there. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta 
(D.ii.147) mentions Campā as one of the six important cities of India, its 
foundation being ascribed to Mahāgovinda (D.ii.235). It lay at a distance of 
sixty yojanas from Mithilā (J.iv.32). In the Buddha’s time the people of Campā 
owed allegiance to Bimbisāra, as king of Magadha, and Bimbisāra had given a 
royal fief in Campā to the brahmin Sonadanda (D.i.111). Campā was evidently an 
important centre of trade, and we are told that merchants travelled from there 
to Suvannabhūmi for purposes of trade (E.g., J.vi.539). Most probably it was the 
Indian colonists from Campā who named one of their most important settlements in 
Indo-China after this famous old town. The ancient name of Campā was probably 
Mālini or Mālina.( Campasya tu puri Campā, yā Mālinyabhavat purā; Mbh.xii.5, 6, 
7; Matsyapurāna 48, 97, etc.; Law, A.G.I.6, n.2).</p>
<p>The ninth chapter of the Mahā Vagga of 
the Vinaya Pitaka (Vin.i.312ff; see also Vin.iī.307) contains several important 
regulations laid down by the Buddha at Campā regarding the validity and 
otherwise of formal acts of the Sangha.</p>
<p>Campā is mentioned as the birthplace of 
Sona-Kolivisa, Jambugāmika, Nandaka and Bharata, and among those who resided 
there were Bāhuna, Vajjiyamāhita and Thullanandā and her companions.</p>
<p>The Sonadanda, the Dasuttara, the 
Kandaraka and the Kārandava Suttas were preached there.</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.565), 
Campā was so called because the whole place abounded in large Campaka-trees.</p>
<p>Campā is generally identified with a 
site about twenty-four miles to the east of the modern Bhagalpur, near the 
villages of Campānagara and Campāpura (C.A.G.I.5). It was visited by Hiouen 
Thsang (Beal, Records ii.187f), and Fa Hien calls it a great kingdom with many 
places of worship (p.65).</p>
<p>The Buddha’s bathing-robe was enshrined 
in Campā (Bu.xxviii.9). See also Kāla Campā, probably another name for Campā.</p>
