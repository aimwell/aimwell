<p>A brahmin maiden of Bārānasī. Having 
seen a young monk begging alms, she asked her mother why men in the prime of 
life should renounce the world. Her mother told her of the appearance of the 
Buddha in the world. An upāsaka who heard the conversation told her more of the 
Buddha and taught her the saranas and the sīlas. Later he told her of the nature 
of the body, and she, reflecting thereon, became a sotāpanna. </p>
<p>After death she became one of Sakka’s 
women-attendants, and her story was related to Moggallāna by Sakka. Vv.i.17; 
VvA.86f.</p>
