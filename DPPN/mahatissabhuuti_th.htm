<p>An incumbent of the Mandalārāma. While begging for alms in 
the village, his mind was defiled by an unusual sight. He therefore returned to 
the vihāra, but, even in his sleep, he was haunted by what he had seen, and, 
greatly agitated, he went to Mahāsangharakkhita and obtained from him a formula 
of meditation with which to counteract the lustful feelings. With this formula 
he went into a thicket and lay on his pamsukūla robe and became an anāgāmī.
