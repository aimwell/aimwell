<p>A park situated between Kapilavatthu and Devadaha. It was 
there that the Buddha was born. (J.i.52, 54; Kvu.97, 559; AA.i.10; MA.ii.924; 
BuA.227; Cv.li.10, etc.). A pillar now marks the spot of Asoka’s visit to 
Lumbinī. According to an inscription on the pillar, it was placed there by the 
people then in charge of the park to commemorate Asoka’s visit and gifts (See 
Mukerji: Asoka, p.27; see p.201f for details). The park is now known as 
Rummindei, inside the Nepal frontier and two miles north of Bhagavanpura.</p>
<p>In the Sutta Nipāta (vs. 683) it is stated that the Buddha 
was born in a village of the Sākyans, in the Lumbineyya Janapada. The Buddha 
stayed in Lumbinīvana during his visit to Devadaha and there preached the 
Devadaha Sutta. MA.ii.810.</p>
