<p>Son of Ilanāga and king of Ceylon 
(103-112 A.C.) for eight years and seven months. His wife was Damilādevī. He was 
killed by his younger brother Yasalālaka-Tissa. Siva built a tank near 
Manikāragāma which he gave to the Issarasamanārāma (Dpv.xxi.44; Mhv.xxxv.46). 
When Ilanāga was taken captive by the Lambakannas, his queen sent the little 
Canda-mukhasiva to the state elephant to be killed by him, but the elephant 
picked him up and brought about Ilanāga’s release. Ibid., vs.20ff</p>
