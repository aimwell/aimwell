  <h2>Verañjā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at 
the invitation of the brahmin Verañja. (In the twelfth year, according to 
Buddhaghosa &nbsp;&nbsp;e.g., AA.ii.758; cf. BuA.3). Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot 
of the Nalerupicumanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, 
the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to 
aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole 
world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour 
anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the 
Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of 
his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the 
conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season 
there. Here he spoke of the Vijjāttaya, says UdA.(p. 183), because all the monks 
with the Buddha were chalabhiññā, and therefore no special mention was needed of 
abhiññā.</p>
<p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred 
householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. 
Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going 
with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this 
stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious 
systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three 
preceding them — Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū
-&nbsp; did not.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take 
leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they 
received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, 
he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in 
the house. The Commentators add that Verañja forgot his invitation because Māra, 
being in a spiteful mood, had taken possession of him and of all the inhabitants 
of Verañja (Sp.i.178 L; DhA.ii.153; cf. J.iii.494).</p>
<p>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next 
day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha 
and a pair to each of the monks.</p>
<p>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing 
through Soreyya, Sankassa and Kannakujja, and crossing the Ganges at 
Payāgapatitthāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the 
Buddha’s visit to Verañja, forms the introduction to the Vinaya and is found at 
Vin.iii.1 11. The interview with Verañja is given at A.iv.172ff. The road taken 
by the Buddha from Verañjā to Benares was, according to Buddhaghosa (Sp.i.201), 
the shortest, and the Buddha knew the monks were tired after their experiences 
in Verañjā. Soon after, he appears to have visited Kapilavatthu. There he was 
visited by Mahānāma, the Sākyan, who asked permission to entertain him and the 
monks for four months that they might recover their strength. At the end of the 
four months he renewed his request, and thus looked after the monks for a whole 
year. It was this act that won for him the title of aggo panītadāyakānam 
(A.A.i.213).</p>
<p>It is said (SNA.i.154; Mil. 232) that the devas put 
flavour (ojā) into every mouthful of food taken by the Buddha at Verañjā. 
According to the Apadāna (Ap.i.301; ApA.i.103f.; cf. UdA.265), the Bodhisatta 
was born of a noble house in the time of Phussa Buddha, and, once, seeing the 
monks eating good food, he had reviled them and asked them to eat oats (yava). 
It was for this reason the Buddha was condemned to eat yava during three months 
at Verañjā.</p>
<p>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Anguttara 
Nikāya (A.ii.57f) contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of 
people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse 
between Sāvatthi and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta (q.v.) was preached to 
some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi, whither they had gone on 
business. The books also record (A.iv.198f ) a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda 
to the Buddha at Verañjā. The Vālodaka Jātaka (q.v.) and the Cullasuka Jātaka 
(q.v.) were preached soon after the Buddha’s return from Verañjā.</p>
