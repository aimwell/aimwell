  <h2>Moliyasīvaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Paribbājaka. He once visited the Buddha at Veluvana and 
questioned him regarding predestination. The Buddha explains to him that 
suffering arises from various causes — 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bile, </li>
  <li>phlegm, </li>
  <li>wind, </li>
  <li>bodily humour, </li>
  <li>change of season, </li>
  <li>stress of untoward happenings, </li>
  <li>sudden attacks from without and also from one’s kamma&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>and to say that these are all predestined is to go too 
far. Sīvaka expresses his approval and declares himself the Buddha’s follower 
(S.iv.230f.; this Sutta is quoted at Mil. 137). Another conversation he had with 
the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.356). There he asks the 
Buddha if the claims made with regard to the Dhamma are justified. The Buddha 
proves to him, by illustration, that they are.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (SA.iii.87) that the Paribbājaka’s 
name was Sīvaka, his sobriquet being due to his having worn his hair in a 
topknot.</p>
