<p>Once the Bodhisatta was king of Takkasilā. Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares, marched on his city with a large army, hoping to capture it; 
but on seeing the towers on the city gates, he took fright and fled.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a mendicant who loved 
arguing. He could find no one to contradict him until he came to Sāvatthi, where 
was the Buddha. Forthwith he set off for Jetavana; but on seeing the gate 
towers, he fled (J.ii.216ff). See also Dutiya Palāyi Jātaka.</p>
