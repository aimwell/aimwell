<p>A vihāra in Ceylon. In it once lived 
fifty monks who agreed on the full-moon day of Āsālha not to talk to each other 
until they became arahants. Their goal was reached within a month (DA.i.190; 
SA.iii.155; SnA.i.57; VibhA.353; MA.i.209f). </p>
<p>This vihāra is very probably identical 
with Galambatittha (q.v.).</p>
