<p><a href="angati.htm" title="ay/angati.htm">Angati</a>, king of 
<a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a> in Videha, is a good ruler. One 
full moon night he consults his ministers as to how they shall amuse themselves. 
Alāta suggests new conquests; Sunāma suggests that they shall seek pleasure in 
dance, song and music; but Vijaya recommends that they shall visit some samana 
or brahmin. Angati falls in with the views of Vijaya, and in great state goes to 
Guna of the Kassapagotta, an ascetic who lives in the park near the city. Guna 
preaches to him that there is no fruit, good or evil, in the moral life; there 
is no other world than this, no strength, no courage; all beings are predestined 
and follow their course like the ship her stern. Alāta approves of the views of 
Guna; he remembers how, in his past life, he was a wicked councillor called 
Pingala; from there he was born in the family of a general, and now he is a 
minister. A slave, Bījaka, who is present, can remember his past life and says 
he was once Bhavasetthi in Sāketa, virtuous and generous, but he is now the son 
of a prostitute. Even now he gives away half his food to any in need, but see 
how destitute he is!</p>
<p>Angati is convinced that Ginda’s doctrine is correct, and 
resolves to find delight only in pleasure. He gives orders that he shall not be 
disturbed in his palace; Candaka, his minister, is deputed to look after the 
kingdom. Fourteen days pass in this manner. Then the king’s only child, his 
beloved daughter Rujā, comes to him arrayed in splendour, attended by her 
maidens, and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants. 
Angati protests; he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury, but has learnt 
too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in 
keeping the fasts.</p>
<p>Rujā is at first amazed, then tells her father that his 
councillors are fools, they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past, 
but remember only one birth or two; they cannot therefore judge. She herself 
remembers several births; in one she was a smith in Rājagaha and committed 
adultery, but that sin remained hidden, like fire covered with ashes, and she 
was born as a rich merchant’s only son in Kosambī. There she engaged in good 
works, but, because of previous deeds, she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya 
and then as a castrated goat in Bhennākata. In her next birth she was a monkey, 
and then an ox among the Dasannas; then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians, and 
later a nymph in Tāvatimsa. Once more her good deeds have come round, and 
hereafter she will be born only among gods and men. Seven births hence she will 
be a male god in Tāvatimsa, and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for 
her.</p>
<p>All night she preaches in this way to her father, but he 
remains unconvinced. The Bodhisatta is a Brahmā, named Nārada Kassapa, and, 
surveying the world, sees Rujā and Angati engaged in conversation. He therefore 
appears in the guise of an ascetic, and Angati goes out to greet and consult 
him. The ascetic praises goodness, charity, and generosity, and speaks of other 
worlds. Angati laughs, and asks for a loan which, he says, he will repay twice 
over in the next world, as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one. 
Nārada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn 
unless he mends his ways, and mentions to him the names of former kings who 
attained to happiness through good lives. The king at last sees his error and 
determines to choose new friends. Nārada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves 
in all majesty.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the conversion of 
<a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Uruvela Kassapa</a>. He came, after his conversion, with the Buddha to Latthivana, 
and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha. He 
dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had 
earlier practised, and, laying his head on the Buddha’s feet did obeisance. Then 
he rose seven times into the air, and, after having worshipped the Buddha, sat 
on one side. The people marvelled at the Buddha’s powers of conversion, which, 
the Buddha said, were not surprising since he possessed them already as a 
Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>Angati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa, Alāta with 
Devadatta, Sunāma with Bhaddiya, Vijaya with Sāriputta, Bījaka with Moggallāna, 
Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta, and Rujā with Ānanda. J.vi.219 55; see also 
J.i.83.</p>
