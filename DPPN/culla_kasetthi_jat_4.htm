<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as 
Cullakasetthi in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. One day, while on his way to the palace, he saw a dead 
mouse lying on the road, and, noticing the position of the stars, he said, “Any 
decent young fellow with his wits about him has only to pick up the mouse and he 
will be a made man.” A young man of good family, called Cullantevāsika, hearing 
this, picked up the mouse and sold it for a farthing to a tavern for their cat 
to eat. With the farthing he bought molasses and drinking water for 
flower-gatherers. Later, he gathered branches and leaves blown down by the wind 
in the king’s garden and sold them to a potter for a large sum of money. He 
entered into friendship with a land-trader and a sea-trader and, by using the 
information he obtained from them, he was able to make two hundred thousand 
pieces by means of skilful and far-sighted business dealings. He then visited 
Cullasetthi to express to him his gratitude, and the setthi, on hearing of his 
skill, was so impressed that he gave him his daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>The young man is identified with 
Cullapanthaka (q.v.), in reference to whom the story was related. J.i.114-23. 
Cf. the story of Visākhila in Kathāsaritsāgara (i.33).</p>
