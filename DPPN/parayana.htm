<h4>Pārāyana Vagga</h4>
<p>The fifth and last division of the <a href="sutta_nipata.htm" title="s/sutta_nipata.htm">Sutta Nipāta</a> 
(SN.vs.976ff). It consists of sixteen suttas preceded by an introduction of 
fifty six Vatthugāthā. The Vatthugāthā describe how <a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a> first heard of 
the coming of the Buddha from a devotee and sent sixteen of his pupils to visit 
the Buddha and find out if his claims to Enlightenment were true. A description 
of the route taken by them is also given. The sixteen suttas give the questions 
asked by Bāvarī’s disciples and the answers given by the Buddha. The 
<a href="niddesa.htm" title="n/niddesa.htm">Culla 
Nidesa</a> comments on the sixteen suttas, but makes no mention of the Vatthugāthā. 
Perhaps, at one time, the <a href="khaggavisaana.htm" title="ku/khaggavisaana.htm">Khaggavisāna Sutta</a> was attached to the Pārāyana 
Vagga.  </p>
<p>The Pārāyana Vagga is mentioned in the <a href="anguttara_nikaya.htm" title="ay/anguttara_nikaya.htm">Anguttara Nikāya</a> (A.i.133, 134; 
ii.45; iv.63) and in the <a href="samyutta_nikaya.htm" title="sa/samyutta_nikaya.htm">Samyutta Nikāya</a> (S.ii.49), which is evidence of its 
having been one of the oldest collections. The Pārāyanaka Samiti is among the 
incidents represented in the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.84). It is said (E.g., AA.i.57) 
that at the end of the discourses contained in the Pārāyana Vagga, fourteen 
crores of beings realized nibbāna.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.717) that the Pārāyana was so 
called because it leads to nibbāna (nibbānasahkhātam pāram ayanato Pārāyanā ti 
laddhavohāram dhammam).</p>

<h4>Pārāyana Sutta</h4>
<p>The Buddha teaches the goal (pārāyana) and the path 
leading thereto. S.iv.373.</p>
