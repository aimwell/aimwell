<p><b>1. Yugandhara.</b> One of the mountains of the Himālaya 
(J.i.119, 232; iv.213; vi.125; DhA.i.249; Vsm.206). It forms the first of the 
seven ranges round Sineru (SNA, ii.443; but according to J.vi.125 it is the 
fourth range).</p>
<p>A Yugandharasāgara (e.g., J.i.64; vi.43) is also sometimes 
mentioned, and was probably a sea between Yugandhara and the next mountain 
range. When the Buddha reached Tāvatimsa in three strides, his first stride was 
from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216). It was on the summit of Yugandhara 
that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan 
of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6). The sun is mentioned as first rising over 
Yugandhara (E.g., SA.ii.165), hence the expression “Like the morning sun over 
Yugandhara.” E.g. PvA.137.</p>

invoked by the Buddha’s followers in time of need. D.iii.205</p>
