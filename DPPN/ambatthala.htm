<p>A little tableland immediately below the 
Silakūta of the Missaka Mountain in Ceylon. It was near here that Mahinda and 
his companions alighted after their aerial journey from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xiii.20). 
There King Mahādāthika-Mahānāga built the Ambatthala Thūpa, risking his own life 
in order to make the building secure. He made a cover for the whole thūpa and, 
at its dedication, held the great Giribhandapūjā (Mhv.xxiv.68-81). 
Kanitthatissaka built a monastery attached to the thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.9), which 
Gothābhaya renovated (Mhv.xxxvi.106).</p>
<p>The vihāra was rebuilt or enlarged by 
Dhātusena. He intended to give it into the charge of the Theravādins, but 
ultimately gave it to the Dhammarucikas at the latters' request (Cv.xxxviii.76). 
Sirimeghavanna had a life-size golden image of Mahinda placed in the Ambatthala 
Cetiya (Cv.xxxvii.69).</p>
<p>It is said that the place was so called 
after the riddle of the mango tree (Mhv.xiv.17ff.) with which Mahinda put 
Devānampiyatissa’s discernment to the test. Even now mango trees are planted 
near the ceitya in memory of the event (Cv.trans. i.4. n.5).</p>
<p>Other names for the place are 
Cetiyambatthala (Cv.xxxvii.69) and Therambatthalaka (Mhv.xxxvi.106).</p>
