So they stayed there, and, as time went on, they grew fat and began to drink 
toddy made from sugar cane.</p>

with their excrement, decided to send a wave up to drown them. A friendly deity, 
wishing to save them, gave them warning; but another cruel deity asked them to 
pay no heed to her words. Five hundred of the families, led by a wise man, built 
a ship in which they placed all their belongings in case the warning should 
prove true. No harm would be done should it prove false. The others, led by a 
fool, laughed at them. At the end of the dark fortnight the sea rose; the five 
hundred wise families escaped, the others were drowned.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to five hundred families
