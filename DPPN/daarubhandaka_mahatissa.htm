<p>A poor man of Valliya Street in Mahāgāma, 
so called because he earned his living by selling wood. He was very poor, and 
once, after consulting with his wife, offered a part of their meal to a young 
monk. He accepted it, but, on seeing how poor it was, threw it away. They were 
greatly grieved, and having obtained twelve kahāpanas by placing their daughter 
in service, bought a cow and gave milk twice daily to the monks. Then, wishing 
to reclaim his daughter, the man worked for six months in a sugar mill, and, 
having obtained the necessary money, was on his way home, when he met 
Pindapātiyatissa Thera of Ambariya-vihāra. As it was meal-time, the man looked 
for food, but could obtain it only by giving away all his money. The food so 
obtained he offered to the thera, who, on learning the man’s story, was so 
greatly moved that he went to Tissamahārāma, put forth great exertion and became 
an arahant. Soon afterwards he died, but before his death he told his colleagues 
the story of his benefactor. King Kākavannatissa made arrangements for the 
thera’s funeral, but it was found that the litter containing the body could not 
be moved until the king sent for the poor man, who lifted it. The body, 
thereupon, travelled through the air on to the funeral pyre, and 
Dārubhandaka-Mahātissa received great honour at the king’s hands.
