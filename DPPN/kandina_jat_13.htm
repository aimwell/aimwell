</ul>
<p>A mountain stag fell in love with a doe 
who had gone into the forest from the village during the time of the ripening of 
the corn. When the time came for the doe to return to the village, the stag, in 
his love, accompanied her. The people of the village, knowing of the deer’s 
return, lay in ambush for them. The doe, seeing a huntsman, sent the stag on 
ahead, and he was killed and eaten. The doe escaped. The Bodhisatta, who was a 
forest-deva, seeing the incident, preached to the other forest-dwellers on the 
three infamies: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>it is infamy to cause another’s death;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>infamous is the land ruled by a woman:
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>infamous are the men who yield 
  themselves to women’s dominance (J.i.153-6).</li>
</ul>
<p>The circumstances in which the story was 
related are given in the Indriya Jātaka.</p>
