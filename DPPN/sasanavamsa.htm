<p>An ecclesiastical chronicle by Paññasāmi of Burma, written 
in 1861 A.C. The first part of the work begins with the birth of the Buddha and 
brings the history up to the Third Council and the sending of missionaries to 
nine different countries: Sīhala, Suvannabhūmi, Yonakarattha, Vanavāsī, Kasmīra 
Gandhāra, Mahimsakamandala, Cīnarattha, Mahārattha (Siam) and Aparanta. Then 
follow accounts of the religions of these countries, a separate chapter being 
devoted to each. But the accounts of Sīhala (Ceylon) and Suvannabhūmi (Burma) 
show more completeness than the others. The second part is entirely devoted to 
Aparanta of Burma proper. Published by the P.T.S.1897.</p>
