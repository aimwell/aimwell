<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in the Udiccabrāmanakula, and 
became a hermit with five hundred pupils. One day his pupils went, with his 
leave, to Benares, to the haunts of men, for salt and vinegar. The king welcomed 
them, and invited them to stay in the royal park for four months. During this 
time a drinking festival was held in the city, and the people, thinking to give 
the hermits a rare gift, entertained them to the best they had. The hermits 
became drunk and behaved with undue hilarity. When they emerged from their 
stupor and realized what they had done, they left the city and hastened back to 
their teacher.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the occasion on 
which Sāgata Thera (q.v.) got drunk. J.i.360f.</p>
