<p>The grove presented by <a href="ambapaalii.htm">Ambapālī</a> to the 
Buddha and the Order. It was in <a href="vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> and was given to the Buddha during his last tour in that town, at the conclusion of the meal to which Ambapālī had 
invited him (Vin.i.231-3). But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed 
there previously during their visits to Vesāli (thus according to D.ii.94 the 
Buddha was already in the grove before Ambapālī visited him; see also S.v.301, 
which must refer to an incident before the Buddha’s last tour, because Sāriputta 
was still alive). </p>
<p>The Buddha is stated to have preached 
three suttas in the grove, two of them being on the value of the satipatthānā (S.v.141ff). In the third sutta (A.iv.100-6) he dwells on the impermanence of 
all sankhāras and proceeds to describe the process by which the whole world will 
ultimately be destroyed by seven suns arising in the world and drying everything 
up. In this sutta appears also the story of the teacher 
<a href="sunetta.htm" title="s/sunetta.htm">Sunetta</a>, who, even after 
becoming the Great Brahma, is yet subject to old age and death.</p>
<p>The Samyutta also records a conversation 
that took place between <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> and 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> during a stay in Ambapālivana 
(S.v.301).</p>
<p>The grove was planted with mangoes and 
was so called because it belonged to Ambapālī. DA.ii.545.</p>
