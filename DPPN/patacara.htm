<h4>1. Patācārā Therī</h4>
<p>An arahant. She was the daughter of a banker of 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, 
and, when grown up, formed an intimacy with a servant. When her parents wished 
to marry her to a youth of her own rank, she ran away with her lover and lived 
in a hamlet. As the time for her confinement drew near, she wished to return to 
her parents, but the husband, on various pretexts, put off the visit. One day 
when he was out she left a message with the neighbours and started for Sāvatthi. 
Her husband followed her, but on the way she gave birth to a son, and they 
returned home. The same happened when her second child was born, but soon after 
its birth a great storm broke, and her husband went to cut some sticks and grass 
in the jungle with which to make a shelter. He was bitten by a snake and died.
</p>
<p>The wife spent the night in misery, lying on the ground 
hugging her children. In the morning she discovered her husband’s body, and 
started off to go to her parents. On the way she had to cross a river, and, 
because it was in flood, she could not carry both her children across at the 
same time. She therefore left the younger on some leaves on the bank and started 
wading across with the other. In midstream she looked back and saw a hawk swoop 
down and carry away the babe. In her excitement she dropped the child she was 
carrying and it was swept away by the flood. Distracted, she went on towards 
Sāvatthi, but on the way she learnt that the house in which her parents and 
brother lived had fallen on them in the night and that they had been burnt on 
one pyre. </p>
<p>Mad with grief, she wandered about in circles, and 
because, as she circled round, her skirt cloth fell from her, she was called 
Patācārā (“cloak walker”). People drove her from their doors, till one day she 
arrived in <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, where the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was preaching. The people round him tried 
to stop her from approaching, but the Buddha called her to him and talked to 
her. By the potency of his gentleness, she regained presence of mind and 
crouched on the earth. A man threw her his outer robe, and she, wearing it, drew 
close to the Buddha, and worshipping at his feet, told him her story and begged 
for his help. </p>
<p>The Buddha spoke to her words of consolation, making her 
realize the inevitability of death; he then taught her the Truth. When he 
finished speaking, she became a Sotāpanna and asked for ordination. Her request 
was granted, and one day, while washing her feet, she noticed how the water 
trickled, sometimes only to a short distance, sometimes further, and she 
pondered, “even so do mortals die, either in childhood, in middle age, or in old 
age.” The Buddha sent her a ray of glory and appeared before her, speaking and 
confirming her thoughts. When he had finished speaking, Patācārā won 
arahantship. She later became a great teacher, and many women, stricken with 
grief, sought her guidance and her consolation (ThigA.47,117,122). She was 
declared by the Buddha to be the best among Therī’s who knew the Vinaya 
(A.i.25).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she was born in a 
clansman’s family, and having heard the Buddha speak of a nun as first among 
those who knew the rules of the Order, she aspired to a similar rank for 
herself.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, she became a Bhikkhunī, and 
was third of the seven daughters of <a href="kikii.htm" title="ku/kikii.htm">Kikī</a>, king of Benares. She built a cell for 
the Order and lived a celibate life for twenty thousand years. </p>
<p>Thig.112 16; ThigA.108ff.. Ap.ii.557f.; AA.ii.194ff.; 
DhA.ii.260ff.; iii.434f.;J.vi.481.</p>
<p>Patācārā is given as an example of one whose grief was 
assuaged by listening to the Dhamma. DA.iii.746; MA.i.188; UdA.127.</p>

<h4><a name="2">2</a>. Patācārā</h4>
<p>One of the five children of two 
<a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Jain</a> disputants, a man and 
a woman, of <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>; they married at the suggestion of the 
<a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavis</a> in order 
that their children might inherit the skill of both. Patācārā and her three 
sisters and one brother were later converted by <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and became arahants.
</p>
<p>Patācārā is identified with one of the daughters of the 
Kalinga king in the <a href="culla_kaalinga_jat_301.htm" title="c/culla_kaalinga_jat_301.htm">Cullakālinga Jātaka</a> (J.iii.1ff). Her brother was the 
Nigantha <a href="saccaka.htm" title="sa/saccaka.htm">Saccaka</a> (MA.i.450).</p>
