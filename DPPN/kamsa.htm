<p><b>1. Kamsa.</b>-Another name, according to the 
scholiast, for Brahmadatta, king of Benares and father of Samuddajā. J.vi.198 
(25).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Kamsa.</b>-King of Benares, and called Bārānasiggaha because he was ruler of Benares. According to the 
<a href="seyya_jat_282.htm" title="s/seyya_jat_282.htm">Seyya Jātaka</a> 
(J.ii.403), he was the king who was seized by the monarch of Kosala, owing to 
the treachery of a disloyal courtier, and who was later set free on account of 
his great piety. In the Ekarāja Jātaka, which purports to relate the same story, 
and again in the <a href="mahasilava_jat_051.htm" title="maha/mahasilava_jat_051.htm">Mahāsīlava Jātaka</a>, the king is referred to by other names. We 
probably have here a confusion of legends due to an effort to make three similar 
stories into one and the same.</p>
<p>It is probably this same Kamsa 
Bārānasiggaha who is referred to in the <a href="tesakuna_jat_521.htm" title="t/tesakuna_jat_521.htm">Tesakuna Jātaka</a>, by the owl Vessantara 
(J.v.112). There the scholiast explains Bārānasiggaha as catūhi sangahavatthūhi 
Bārānasim gahetvā vattanto.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Kamsa.</b>-Son of Mahākamsa and brother 
of Upakamsa and <a href="devagabbhaa.htm" title="d/devagabbhaa.htm">Devagabbhā</a>.  </p>
<p>Later he became king of <a href="asitanjana.htm" title="ay/asitanjana.htm">Asitañjana</a> in Kamsabhoga in 
the <a href="uttaraapatha.htm" title="u/uttaraapatha.htm">Uttarāpatha</a>.  </p>
<p>He was killed by <a href="vaasudeva.htm" title="va/vaasudeva.htm">Vasudeva</a>, one of the 
<a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">Andhakavenhudā-saputtā</a> 
(J.iv.79f).</p>
