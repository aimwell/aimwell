<p>A devaputta who visited the Buddha and 
told him that the path of the Ariyan disciples was hard to follow and their goal 
hard to win. The Buddha pointed out to him that the difficult thing had been and 
was being accomplished (S.i.48).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.83) 
explains that Kﾄ［ada had been a yogﾄ」acara on earth, but had died before he 
could attain to any Fruits of the Path and that here he laments his 
disappointment.</p>
