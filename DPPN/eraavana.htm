<p><b>1. Erāvana.</b>-<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka’s</a> elephant. He was 
once the elephant of the king of <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, who gave him to
<a href="maagha.htm" title="ma/maagha.htm">Māgha</a> and his 
companions to help them in their good works on earth. As a result, when Magha 
and the others were reborn in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>, Erāvana was born there himself and 
became their companion. Ordinarily he was a deva like the others, because there 
are no animals in the deva-world, but when they went to the park to play, 
Erāvana assumed the form of an elephant, one hundred and fifty leagues in size. 
For the thirty-three devas Erāvana erected thirty-three heads (kumbha), each two 
or three quarters of a league in girth. Each head had seven tusks, each fifty 
leagues long, each tusk bore seven lotus plants, each plant seven flowers, each 
flower seven leaves, and on each leaf danced seven nymphs (Padumaceharā). For 
Sakka himself there was a special head, Sudassana, thirty leagues around, above 
it a canopy of twelve leagues all of precious stones. In the centre was a 
jewelled couch one league long, on which Sakka reclined in state. DhA.i.273f; 
also SnA.i.368f. (where there are a few slight variations).</p>
<p>In the <a href="dhammika_v_s.htm" title="d/dhammika_v_s.htm">Dhammika Sutta</a> (Sn.v.379) Erāvana 
is mentioned among the devas who visited the Buddha to pay him homage. He is 
also mentioned among the Nāgas present at the preaching of the 
<a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya Sutta</a> 
(D.ii.258; perhaps here a king of snakes is meant, because he is mentioned with 
others who are avowedly snakes). It is emphasised in several places (E.g., 
MA.i.472; DA.ii.688; also VvA.15 and Kvu.ii.599) that Erāvana is a devaputta and 
a Nāga only by birth (jātiyā). The Jātakas (J.v.137) mention Sakka as riding 
Erāvana, particularly when making comparisons between kings parading on the 
backs of elephants (E.g., V.iii.392). Erāvana is one of the chief features of 
Tāvatimsa (V.vi.278).</p>
