  <h2>Pārupanā</h2>

<p>The name given to one of the two parties of disputants in 
a controversy which arose in Burma in the eighteenth century, regarding the 
manner in which the robe should be draped by Buddhist monks. The Pārupanas held 
that both shoulders should be covered, while their opponents, the Ekamsikas, 
maintained that it was sufficient to drape one shoulder.</p>
<p>For a fairly full account of the controversy, see Sās. pp. 
117 ff.</p>
