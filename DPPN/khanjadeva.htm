<p>One of the ten chief warriors of 
Dutthagāmanī. He was the youngest son of Abhaya, a householder of Mahisadonika 
in the Nakulanaga district. His name was Deva, but because of a slight limp he 
came to be known as Khañjadeva. When out hunting with the villagers, he would 
chase and catch buffaloes, grasp their leg with his hand, whirl them round his 
head and dash them on the ground, breaking their bones. Kākavannatissa, hearing 
of this, caused him to be brought to the court. Later, Khañjadeva took part in 
Dutthagāmanī’s campaigns. Mhv.xxiii.3, 78ff. See also Ras.ii.99f.</p>
