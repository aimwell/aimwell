<p>A rich setthi of Bheruva. He gave 
generously to holy men and to the needy. After death he was born in 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">TƒÅvatimsa</a>.
</p>
<p>A former servant of Ankura, who had 
settled down as a tailor in Bheruva, used to show the way to those who sought 
the house of Asayha, and was, therefore, reborn as a powerful Yakkha (PvA.112).
</p>
<p>In the Peta-Vatthu stanzas Asayha is 
once spoken of as Angirasa (p.25, v.23).</p>
