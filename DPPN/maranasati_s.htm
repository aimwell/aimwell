<p><b>1. Maranasati Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells the monks 
  at Nādika that mindfulness of death, if properly cultivated, leads to great 
  advantages. Various monks thereupon claim that they practise such mindfulness, 
  but the Buddha tells them their practice is not sufficiently diligent and 
  instructs them how to improve it. A.iv.317f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Maranasati Sutta.</b> Preached at Nādika. A monk 
  must ever remember that death may overtake him at any instant. He must, 
  therefore, examine himself day and night and put away any evil states that may 
  remain in him. A.iv.320f.</p>
