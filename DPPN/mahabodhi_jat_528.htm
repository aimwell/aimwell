  <h2>Mahābodhi Jātaka (No. 528)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was born in an Udiccabrahmin family, and, 
on growing up, renounced the world. His name was Bodhi. </p>
<p>Once, during the rains, he came to Benares, and, at the 
invitation of the king, stayed in the royal park. The king had five councillors, 
unjust men, who sat in the judgment hall giving unjust judgments. One day a man, 
who had been very badly treated by them, asked Bodhi to intervene. Bodhi reheard 
the case and decided in his favour. The people applauded, and the king begged 
Bodhi to dispense justice in his court. Bodhi reluctantly agreed and twelve 
years passed. The former councillors, deprived of their gains, plotted against 
Bodhi and constantly poisoned the king’s mind against him; they first decreased 
all the honours paid to Bodhi, and when this failed to drive him away, obtained 
the king’s permission to kill him. </p>
<p>A tawny dog, to whom Bodhi used to give food from his 
bowl, overheard the plot, and, when Bodhi approached the palace the next day, 
bared his teeth and barked as a warning of the conspiracy. Bodhi understood, 
returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king’s expression of remorse, left the 
city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village. The 
councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and 
the queen were conspiring to slay him. Believing their words, he had the queen 
put to death. The queen’s four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was 
in great danger and fear. </p>
<p>When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, 
went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park. The king came to do him 
honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin. The king asked him why 
he did so. He answered, “This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I 
travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and 
performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate 
its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin.”  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(He had used the skin for his 
garment, hence “I sat on the monkey’s back”; he had the skin on his shoulder, 
whence his water pot was suspended, hence “it carried the water pot”; he had 
swept the cell with the skin, hence “swept my dwelling place”; he had eaten the 
flesh of the monkey, hence “I ate its flesh”).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The councillors who were present 
made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor. But Bodhi knew that of 
these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything 
to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, 
one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should 
secure one’s interests, even to the extent of killing one’s parents. He, 
therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with 
their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey. 
Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in 
slanderers, and asked the king’s sons to obtain their father’s pardon. The king 
wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were 
disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.</p>
