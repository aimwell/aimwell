  <h2>Kāranapālī</h2>

</ul>
<p>A brahmin employed as superintendent of 
works by the Licchavis of Vesālī. One morning early he saw Pingiyānī evidently 
returning from somewhere, and on inquiry learnt that he had been to see the 
Buddha. Kāranapālī asked him what he thought of the Buddha, and Pingiyānī sang 
his praises, illustrating his meaning with various figures of speech. Convinced 
by Pingiyānī’s earnestness, Kāranapālī knelt on the ground and expressed his 
homage to the Buddha (A.iii.236ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary (AA.ii.636) says that the 
man’s name was Pāla (or Pālī), and he was called Kāranapālī because he 
supervised the business of various chieftains' families.</p>
