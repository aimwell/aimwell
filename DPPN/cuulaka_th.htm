<p>A brahmin of Rājagaha who, having seen 
the Buddha tame the elephant Dhanapāla, entered the Order and dwelt in the 
Indasāla cave. One day, as he sat looking down over the Magadhakhetta, a great 
storm arose and the rain came down in torrents. The peacocks danced and sang and 
the coolness helped Cūlaka to concentrate his mind and attain arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
householder and gave to the Buddha a chattapāni-fruit. Thag.211f.; ThagA.i.333f.</p>
