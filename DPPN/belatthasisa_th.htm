  <h2>Belatthasīsa Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An arahant, preceptor of <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>. He was once afflicted 
with scurvy and his robes clung to him. The monks thereupon applied water to the 
robes, but when the Buddha heard of it he made a rule allowing necessary 
therapeutic measures (Vin.i.202, 295f). </p>
<p>At one time this Thera would lie in the forest where he 
kept a store of dried boiled rice. When he needed food, after samāpatti he would 
sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms. When this was 
reported to the Buddha, he blamed Belatthasīsa for storing up food and 
promulgated a rule forbidding this (Vin.iv.86). </p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.171), however, states 
that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down, and, because the 
food was stored, not because of greed but through lack of covetousness, the 
Buddha declared Balatthasīsa free from guilt.</p>
<p>Belatthasīsa was a brahmin of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> who had left the 
world under <a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Uruvela Kassapa</a> before the Buddha’s Enlightenment and was converted 
when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha. </p>
<p>He had been a monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, but 
could achieve no attainment. He once gave a mātulunga fruit to Vessabhū Buddha 
(ThagA.i.67 ff.; Thag.vs.16).  </p>
<p>He is probably identical with <a href="m4_may.htm#Matulungaphaladayaka" title="ma/m4_may.htm#Matulungaphaladayaka">Mātulungaphaladāyaka</a> of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.446.</p>
