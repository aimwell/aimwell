</ul>
<p>A Cola monk, follower of the Vetullavāda. At the Thūpārāma 
he defeated in argument the Thera Gothābhaya, and became a favourite of King 
Gothābhaya, being appointed tutor to his sons, Jetthatissa and Mahāsena. When 
Jenhatissa came to the throne, Sanghamitta returned to Cola, as he was not 
greatly liked by the king; but on the accession of Mahāsena he returned to 
Ceylon.  </p>
<p>Acting on Sanghamitta’s advice, Mahāsena decreed that no alms should be 
given to the monks of Mahāvihāra and all the treasures belonging to Mahāvihāra 
were taken to Abhayagiri with the help of the minister Sona. Sanghamitta had the 
Lohapāsāda destroyed. It was not till his favourite minister, Meghavannābhaya, 
rose in revolt against him, that Mahāsena saw the error of his ways and cast off 
Sanghamitta. While the king was away, Sanghamitta attempted to destroy the 
Thūpārāma, and one of the king’s wives persuaded a labourer to kill both 
Sanghamitta and Sona. Mhv.xxxvi.113f; xxxvii.2ff.; Cv.xxxviii.55, 58.</p>
