<ul>
  <li>
  <h2>Ājīvakā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of naked ascetics (see, e.g., 
Vin.i.291), followers of <a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali Gosāla</a>, regarded, from the Buddhist point of 
view, as the worst of sophists. Numerous references to the Ājīvakas are to be 
found in the Pitakas, only a few of them being at all complimentary. Thus in the 
<a href="mahasaccaka_s.htm" title="maha/mahasaccaka_s.htm">Mahā Saccaka Sutta</a> (*) they are spoken of as going about naked, flouting life’s 
decencies and licking their hands after meals. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*) M.i.238; see also S.i.66, where a 
  deva praises Gosāla as a man who had attained to perfect self-control by 
  fasting and austere practices. He had abandoned speech and wordy strife with 
  any person, was equable, a speaker of truth, a doer of no evil. That the life 
  of the Ājīvakas was austere may be gleaned from their condemnation of monks 
  carrying parasols (Viii.ii.130).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they never incurred the guilt </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>of obeying another man’s command, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>of accepting food specially prepared for 
them, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>of accepting food from people while 
eating, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>from a pregnant woman, or nursing 
mother, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>or from gleanings in time of famine; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>they would never eat where a dog was 
already at hand, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>or where hungry flies were congregated. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>They never touched flesh, fish or 
intoxicants, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>and they had a rigid scale of food 
rationing. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is mentioned that they did not always 
find it possible to adhere to this rigid code of conduct.</p>
<p>It is stated in the 
<a href="tevijja_vaccha_s.htm" title="t/tevijja_vaccha_s.htm">Tevijja Vacchagotta 
Sutta</a> (M.i.483) that far from any Ājīvaka having put an end to sorrow, the 
Buddha could recall only one Ājīvaka during ninety-nine kappas who had even gone 
to heaven, and that one too had preached a doctrine of kamma and the 
after-consequences of actions. Elsewhere (M.i.524) they are spoken of as 
children of a childless mother. They extol themselves and disparage others and 
yet they have produced only three shining lights:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p><a href="nanda_vaccha.htm" title="n/nanda_vaccha.htm">Nanda Vaccha, 
</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="kisasankicca.htm" title="ku/kisasankicca.htm">Kisa Sankicca</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali Gosāla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A fourth leader,
<a href="panduputta.htm" title="pa/panduputta.htm">Panduputta</a>, of wagon-building stock, is 
mentioned in the Anangana Sutta (M.i.31); there is also the well-known 
<a href="upaka.htm" title="u/upaka.htm">Upaka</a>.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Ājīvaka were 
highly esteemed and had large followings of disciples (See, e.g., Pasenadi’s 
evidence in S.i.68, apart from Ajātasattu’s visit mentioned in the Sāmaññaphala 
Sutta; also S.iv.398). They had eminent followers such as high court officials 
(Vin.ii.166; iv.71) and that, for centuries at least, they retained an important 
position, is shown by their being thrice mentioned in the Asoka Edicts as 
receiving royal gifts (Hultsch: Asoka Inscriptions, see Index).</p>
<p>The doctrines held by the Ājīvaka are 
mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the 
<a href="samannaphala_s.htm" title="sa/samannaphala_s.htm">Sāmaññaphala 
Sutta</a> where they are attributed to Makkhali Gosāla by name (D.i.53-4. See also 
M.i.516f). He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity 
or purity among beings. There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy 
or human might or endeavour. All creatures, all beings, everything that has 
life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion 
of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by 
virtue of their birth in the six environments (chalabhijātiyo) that they 
experience their pleasure or pain. The universe is divided into various classes 
of beings, of occupations and methods of production. There are eighty-four 
hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in 
transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. The pleasures and pain, 
measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of 
transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither 
excess nor deficiency.</p>
<p>The fundamental point in their teaching 
seems, therefore, to have been “samsāra-suddhi,” purification through 
transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent 
things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of 
time.</p>
<p>According to 
<a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (DA.i.161), in 
the classification of the Ājīvaka:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>“all beings” (sattā) meant all kinds of 
animals, camels, cows, asses, etc.;  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>“all lives” (pānā) comprised all sensitive 
things and sentient creatures divided into those with one sense (ekendriya), 
those with two senses and so forth;  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>“all existent things” (bhūtā) 
denoted all living beings divided into generic types — viz., those produced from 
an egg, or born from the womb, or sprung from moisture, or propagated from seed;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>“all 
living substances” (jivā) denoted rice, barley, wheat, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The division of men into six classes (chalabhijātiyo) 
is noteworthy. Buddhaghosa describes these as being kanha, nīla, lohita, halidda, 
sukka and paramasukka. This closely resembles the curious Jaina doctrine of the 
six Lesyas. Given, e.g., in the Uttarādhyāyana Sutra (Jacobi’s Jaina Sūtras 
ii.213). This seems to involve a conception of mind which is originally 
colourless by nature. The different colours (nīla, etc.) are due to different 
habits or actions. The supreme spiritual effort consists in restoring mind to 
its original purity. Cp. with this the Buddha’s teaching in A.iii.384ff. and 
M.i.36. </p>
<p>In the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.383-4) a 
similar doctrine is attributed to <a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Pūrana Kassapa</a>.</p>
<p>Gosāla’s theory (D.i.54; see also 
S.iii.211) of the divisions of the universe into fourteen hundred thousand 
principle states of birth — (pamukhayoniyo) and into various methods of 
regeneration — viz.,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>seven kinds of animate (saññigabbhā) production, i.e. by 
means of separate sexes;  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>seven of inanimate (asaññigabbhā), such as rice, 
barley, etc.;  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>seven of production by grafting (niganthigabbhā), propagating by 
joints, such as sugar cane, etc. —  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>seems to show that the Ājīvaka believed in 
infinite gradations of existence, in the infinity of time, and also in the 
recurrent cycles of existence. Each individual has external existence, if not 
individually, at least in type. In the world as a whole everything comes about 
by necessity. Fate (nigati) regulates everything, all things being unalterably 
fixed. Just as a ball of string when cast forth spreads out just as far as, and 
no farther than it can unwind, so every being lives, acts, enjoys and ultimately 
ends, in the manner in which it is destined (sandhavitvā, samsaritvā 
dukkhassantam karissanti). The peculiar nature (bhāva) (DA.i.161) of each being 
depends on the class or species or type to which it belongs.</p>
<p>Among the views of the Puthusamanas 
(other teachers), the Buddha regarded the doctrine of the Ājīvaka as the least 
desirable. It denied  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>action (kiriya),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>endeavour (viriya),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>result of action (kamma), 
 
</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>and was therefore despicable (patikhitto) (A.i.286).  </p>
<p>The Buddha knew of no other 
single person fraught with such danger and sorrow to all devas and men as was Makkhali; like a fish-trap set at a river mouth, Makkhali was born into the 
world to be a man-trap for the distress and destruction of men (A.i.33).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166), 
 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p><a href="purana_kassapa.htm" title="pu/purana_kassapa.htm">Pūrana Kassapa</a>, by propounding a theory of the passivity of soul, denied action; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="ajitakesakambala.htm" title="am/ajitakesakambala.htm">Ajita Kesakambala</a>, 
by his theory of annihilation, denied retribution, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="makkhali_gosala.htm" title="ma/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali Gosāla</a>, 
by his doctrine of fate, denied both action and its result.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It has been suggested (E.g. Barua: Pre-Buddhistic 
Indian Philosophy, p.314) that Makkhali Gosāla’s doctrine of the eight 
developmental stages of man (attha purisabhūmi) was a physical antecedent of the 
Buddha’s doctrine of the eight higher spiritual ranks (attha purisapuggalā). 
 
</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa gives the eight stages as follows: manda, khiddā, vīmamsana, ujugata, 
sekha, samana, jina and panna. DA.i.162 ; see also Hoernle’s Uvāsaga-Dasāo, ii. 
p.24, where pannaka is given for panna. op. J.iv.496-7, 
mandadasaka,khiddā-dasaka,anna-dasaka,etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>The first stage extends from the first 
day of birth to the seventh.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>In the second stage those who have come from evil 
states cry constantly, those from happy conditions smile, remembering their past 
lives.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The third stage is marked by the infant beginning to walk with the help 
of others. The time of his being able to walk alone is the ujugata-bhūmi.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The 
period of study is sekha-bhūmi,  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>of leaving household life, samana-bhūmi;  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the 
period of knowledge (vijānana),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>of constant association with teachers, is the jina-bhūmi and  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the last stage when the jina remains silent (pannaka), is called 
the pannaka-bhūmi. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to indicate a development of 
the mental and spiritual faculties, side by side with physical growth, an 
interaction of body and mind.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a great deal of 
confusion, even at the time of the compilation of the Nikāyas, as to what were 
the specific beliefs of the Ājīvakas.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Thus in the Mahāli Sutta of the Samyutta 
Nikāya (iii.69) some of Gosāla’s views (natthi hetu, natthi paccayo sattānam 
sankilesāya) are attributed to Pūrana Kassapa.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The Anguttara Nikāya in one place 
(i.286) apparently confounds Makkhali Gosāla with Ajita Kesakambala,  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>while 
elsewhere (iii.383-4) Pūrana Kassapa’s views regarding the chalabhijāti are 
represented as being those of Makkhali.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There was a group of Ājīvakas behind 
Jetavana. The monks saw the Ājīvakas perform various austerities, such as 
squatting on their heels, swinging in the air like bats, scorching themselves 
with five fires, and they asked the Buddha whether these austerities were of any 
use. “None whatever,” answered the Buddha, and then proceeded to relate the 
<a href="nanguttha_jat_144.htm" title="n/nanguttha_jat_144.htm">Nanguttha Jātaka</a> (J.i.493f).</p>
<p>The Ājīvakas used to be consulted 
regarding auspicious days, dreams, omens, etc. (See, e.g., J.i.287 and MT.190).
</p>
<p>There was a settlement of Ājīvakas in 
<a href="anuraadhapura.htm" title="ay/anuraadhapura.htm">Anurādhapura</a>, and Pandukābhaya built a residence for them. Mhv.x.102.</p>
<p>Thomas, following Hoernle, thinks that 
the term (Ājīvaka) was probably a name given by opponents, meaning one who 
followed the ascetic life for the sake of a livelihood. Op. cit., p.130. But see 
DhA.i.309, where the different kinds of religieux are distinguished as acelaka, 
ājīvaka, nigantha and tāpasa.  </p>
<p>For a detailed account of the Ājīvakas see 
Hoernle’s Article in ERA. and Barua’s paper in the Calcutta University Journal 
of the Dept. of Letters, vol.ii. Hence we cannot infer that the name 
which was found as late as the thirteenth century always refers to the followers 
of Makkhali Gosāla. This point is certainly worth investigating.</p>
