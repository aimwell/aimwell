  <h2>Kāludāyī Thera</h2>

<p>Son of one of Suddhodana’s ministers at 
Kapilavatthu; he was born on the same day as the Buddha and grew up as his 
playfellow. After Gotama left the world, Suddhodana made Kāludāyī one of his 
most trusted counsellors. When the king heard of his son’s Enlightenment he sent 
several of his ministers with large retinues to bring the Buddha to 
Kapilavatthu, but they all became arahants as soon as they heard the Buddha’s 
preaching and then forgot their mission. In the end the king sent Kāludāyī, on 
the understanding that he should first be allowed to join the Order. (According 
to Mtu.iii.233, he was accompanied by Channa in this mission). He went to the 
Buddha and, having listened to him, himself became an arahant. When the rains 
fell, covering the earth with the glory of leaves and flowers, Kāludāyī felt 
that it was time for the Buddha to visit his kinsmen, and gave him their 
invitation, singing the season’s beauties in a series of verses. The Buddha took 
sixty days in covering the sixty leagues from Rājagaha to Kapilavatthu, and each 
day Kāludāyī went by air to the king’s palace to tell him of the progress made 
in the journey and to bring back to the Buddha from the palace a bowl full of 
excellent food. By the time the Buddha reached his home his kinsmen were already 
full of faith in him. Because Kāludāyī accomplished this feat, he was declared 
pre-eminent among those who gladdened the clans (kulappasādakānam aggo) (A.i.25; 
Thag.527-36; J.i.54, 86f; AA.i.107, 117; ThagA.i.497ff; UdA.168; 
DA.ii.425).</p>
<p>It is said that he was called Udāyī 
because he was born on a day on which the citizens were full of joy (udaggacittadivase 
jātattā); and called Kāla because of his slightly dark colour. AA.i.167; 
ThagA.i.498.</p>
<p>According to the Apadāna (ii.500f; see 
also Ap.i.86f, where another set of verses is attributed to Kāludāyī), Kāludāyī 
had been the son of a minister of Hamsavatī during the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha, and having heard the Buddha utter the praises of a monk skilled in 
converting families, had wished for the same eminence.</p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iv.449f) records 
a conversation between Udāyī (who, according to Buddhaghosa (AA.ii.815), is to 
be identified with Kāludāyī) and Ānanda. Udāyī asks Ānanda to explain in detail 
a question which is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.48) as having been 
asked of the Buddha by Pañcālacanda-devaputta (see Pañcāla Sutta).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.143) 
refers to an assembly at which Kāludāyī was present, his body of golden hue, 
sitting near Pasenadi, at sunset, with the moon rising in the eastern sky. 
Ānanda looks at them and declares how the Buddha suffuses them all with his 
glory.</p>
<p>Kāludāyī is identified with Sakka in the 
Bhisa Jātaka (J.iv.314).</p>
