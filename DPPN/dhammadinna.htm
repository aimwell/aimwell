<p>1. Dhammadinna Thera.-Also called 
Mahādhammadinna. An arahant. He resided at Talanga-(Talangatissa-pabbata) 
(q.v.). He was one of the monks who partook of the meal of sour gruel given by 
Dutthagāmanī when in dire distress for want of food. Dhammadinna distributed his 
share among ten thousand monks in Piyangudīpa (Mhv.xxxii.52). He is also 
mentioned (MT.606) as having accepted a meal given by Sāliya and his wife when 
they were blacksmiths in a previous birth. Dhammadinna had a nephew who became 
an arahant in the tonsure-hall. Dhammadinna read to him the three Pitakas, and 
he learnt them all on that occasion (VibhA.389). Dhammadinna’s teacher was 
Mahānāga of Uccatalanka (v.l. Uccavālika). Dhammadinna visited him in his old 
age, knowing that, though he himself thought he had attained arahantship, this 
was not the case. By a display of iddhi-power, Dhammadinna convinced Mahānāga of 
his error and gave him a subject of meditation. Almost immediately after, the 
Elder became an arahant (VibhA.489; Vsm.634f). Once, while preaching the 
Apannaka Sutta, at Tissamahārāma, Dhammadinna pointed his fan downwards, 
whereupon the earth opened to the depth of Avīci, revealing all that was there. 
Similarly, he showed all things to the height of the Brahma-world. During his 
sermon he frightened the audience with the fear of hell and lured them with the 
bliss of heaven (Vsm.392).</p>
<p>The Majjhima Commentary records that 
soon after the ordination of Dhammadinna many monks, on his advice, became 
arahants. (MA.i.149ff. A variation of what is evidently the same story is found 
in AA.i.25). Hearing of this, the monks of Tissamahārāma sent a number of their 
colleagues to fetch him. He preached to them, and they attained arahantship and 
remained with him. Three times this happened. On the fourth occasion an aged 
monk was sent. He gave the message of the monks and Dhammadinna started at once 
to go to them. On the way, at Hankana (v.l. Tangana) and at Cittalapabbata, he 
persuaded two monks, who thought they were arahants, to display their 
iddhi-power, and, thereby convinced them of their error; thereupon he gave them 
topics of meditation. On his arrival at Tissamahārāma, the monks failed to pay 
him their respects. He thereupon made the earth tremble and returned to his own 
vihāra. The Saddhammasangaha (p.88f) relates the story of a blind rat-snake who 
heard Dhammadinna recite the satipatthānas and was later born as Tissāmacca, 
minister of Dutthagāmani.</p>

<p>2. Dhammadinna.-An eminent lay-follower 
of the Buddha. He once came with five hundred upāsakas to the Buddha at 
Isipatana and asked him to give them a lesson which might profit them, for, said 
he, it is difficult for a householder encumbered with a family and the luxuries 
of household life to comprehend the Buddha’s teachings in their fullness. The 
Buddha answers that they should practise the four limbs of sotāpatti: loyalty to 
the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of Āriyan virtues. 
Dhammadinna answers that they already possess these limbs. The Buddha then 
expresses his great satisfaction (S.v.406ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.iii.223) says that 
Dhammadinna was one of seven laymen with followings of five hundred — the others 
being Visākha, Ugga, Citta, Hatthaka Ālavaka and Cūla- and Mahā-Anāthapindika.</p>

<p>3. Dhammadinna. A monk of Tissamahā-vihāra 
near Talañgarapabbata. Once, while on pilgrimage to Nāgadīpa with 500 others, he 
stopped at Sāgiri Vihāra, and they were looked after by Bahulamassutissa Thera. 
The next day they went for alms to Punnsālakotthaka, where a resident 
entertained them to a meal with hare’s flesh. Dhammadinna later asked why Tissa 
Thera did not admonish his follower on the evils of killing, seeing that there 
was a heap of bones outside the house. Tissa asked Dhammadinna to do so the next 
day. This was done; the devotee confessed that he had never killed a hare, but 
in his house there was never any want of hare’s flesh, and he did not know why. 
Dhammadinna, with his divine eye, revealed to him that in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha he had given alms with hare’s flesh. Ras.ii.128f.</p>
