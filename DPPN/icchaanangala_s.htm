<p>Preached to the monks at Icchﾄ］angala at 
the end of the three months' solitude referred to above. </p>
<p>Should anyone ask the monks how the 
Buddha spent his time during the rainy season, they should reply that he spent 
it in intense concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing. A life spent by 
anyone in such concentration would be a life spent according to the Ariyan way 
and would lead to the destruction of the ﾄ《avas (S.v.325f).</p>
