<p>The name of King <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena’s</a> park at 
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a> on the river. It was a favourite spot of 
<a href="pindola.htm" title="pu/pindola.htm">Pindola-Bhāradvāja</a>, who often spent the 
day there. On one occasion when he was there, Udena came with the women of the 
palace to the pleasaunce to enjoy himself. When the king fell asleep the women 
wandered about the park and, seeing Pindola, they went up to him and he preached 
to them. The king, on waking, was enraged to find the women absent and, on 
learning the cause, went to Pindola and questioned him. Pindola, knowing that 
the king had no wish to learn, sat silent. The king, in great anger, threatened 
to cast a net of red ants on the Elder, but before he could carry out his 
threat, Pindola vanished through the air (SnA.ii.514f; SA.iii.27f).</p>
