  <h2>Brahmajāla Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya. It was preached to 
the paribbājaka Suppiya and his disciple Brahmadatta. It first explains the sīlā, 
or moral precepts, in three successive sections&nbsp;&nbsp; cūla (concise), 
majjhima (medium), and mahā (elaborate)&nbsp;&nbsp; and then proceeds to set out 
in sixty two divisions various speculations and theories regarding the “soul” 
(D.i.46). Other names for it are Atthajāla, Dhammajāla, Ditthijāla, and 
Sangāmavijaya. At the end of the discourse the ten world systems trembled 
(D.i.46). It is said that once when Pinndapātiya Thera recited this sutta at the 
Kalyāniya vihāra, his mind concentrated on the Buddha, the earth trembled; the 
same phenomenon occurred when the Dīghabhānaka Theras recited it at the 
Ambahtthikā, to the east of the Lohapāsāda (DA.i.131).</p>
<p>The Brahmaj'āla was the first sutta preached in 
Suvannabhūmi, when Sona and Uttara visited it as missionaries (Mhv.xii.51).</p>
<p>The Sutta is often quoted, sometimes even in the Canon. 
E.g., S.iv. 286, 287.</p>
