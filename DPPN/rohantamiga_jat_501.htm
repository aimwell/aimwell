  <h2>Rohantāmiga Jātaka (No. 501)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Rohanta, a golden deer, king over eighty 
thousand deer, near Lake Rohanta. He had a brother, Cittamiga, and a sister 
Sutanā. One day Khemā, wife of the king of Benares, dreamed that a golden deer 
preached to her and begged the king to make the dream come true. The king 
offered great rewards, and a hunter, who was aware of Rohanta’s existence, 
undertook to bring him to the court. He set a trap in the ford where the deer 
drank and Rohanta was caught in it. When Rohanta gave the alarm, all the deer 
fled except Cittamiga and Sutanā. They told the hunter that they would die with 
their brother rather than leave him, and the hunter, touched by their devotion, 
set Rohanta free. When Rohanta discovered why he had been caught, he offered to 
go to Benares, but was dissuaded by the hunter owing to the risks he would run. 
Rohanta then taught the Law to the hunter and sent him back with a golden hair 
from his body. The hunter related the story to the king and queen and preached 
to them the Law. Then rejecting the rewards they offered him, he became an 
ascetic in the Himālaya.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Ānanda’s attempt to throw himself 
before the elephant Dhanapāla, who was sent to kill the Buddha. Ānanda is 
identified with Cittamiga, Channa with the hunter, Sāriputta with the king and 
Uppalavannā with Sutanā. J.iv.413ff.; some of the verses of this Jātaka are 
found also in the Tesakuda Jātaka (J.v.123f.).</p>
