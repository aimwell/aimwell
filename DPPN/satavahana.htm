<p>A king. It is said that, (DA.i.303; is this Sātavāhana the 
king of the Kathāsaritsāgara i.32?) when Anāthapindika’s family fell into 
poverty, owing to the alms given by him, a girl of the family, wishing to give 
alms, went to Sātavāhana’s kingdom, swept a threshing floor and gave alms with 
the money so obtained. A monk told this to the king, who sent for the girl and 
made her his chief queen. v.l. Setavāhana.</p>
