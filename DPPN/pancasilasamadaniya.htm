<p>An arahant. He belonged to a family of Māhāsāla brahmins 
in Vesāli and became an arahant at the age of five. It is said that he heard his 
parents take the five precepts, and remembered his own actions of a past life 
when, in the time of Anomadassī Buddha, he was a ferryman on the Candavatī and 
took the five precepts from the Buddha’s disciple Nisabha, keeping them for one 
hundred thousand years. Thirty times he was king of the devas and five hundred 
times king of men. Ap.i.76f.</p>
