<p><b>1. Māgandiya.</b> A brahmin of the Kuru country. He had 
a very beautiful daughter, called <a href="maagandiyaa.htm" title="ma/maagandiyaa.htm">Māgandiyā</a>. Many men of high station sought her 
hand, but the brahmin did not consider them worthy. The Buddha, one day, became 
aware that both Māgandiya and his wife were ready for conversion, so he visited 
their village. Māgandiya saw him, and, noting the auspicious marks on his body, 
told him of his daughter and begged him to wait till she could be brought. The 
Buddha said nothing, and Māgandiya went home and returned with his wife and 
daughter arrayed in all splendours. On arriving, they found the Buddha had gone, 
but his footprint was visible, and Māgandiya’s wife, skilled in such matters, 
said that the owner of such a footprint was free from all passion. But Māgandiya 
paid no attention, and, going a little way, saw the Buddha and offered him his 
daughter. The Buddha thereupon told them of his past life, his renunciation of 
the world, his conquest of Māra, and the unsuccessful attempts of Māra’s very 
beautiful daughters to tempt him. Compared with them, Māgandiya was, he said, a 
corpse, filled with thirty two impurities, an impure vessel painted without; he 
would not touch her with his foot. At the end of the discourse, Māgandiya and 
his wife became anāgāmins. DhA.iii.193ff.; SNA.ii.542f.; cp. Dvy.515ff., where 
the name is given as Mākandika and he is called a parivrājaka. The daughter’s 
name is given as Anūpamā and the wife’s Sākalī.</p>
<p>It is said that they gave their daughter into the charge 
of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya, retired<span lang="en-us"> 
from the world, and became arahants. DhA.i.202</p>
<p>According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.235f), 
Māgandiya’s village was Kammāsadamma, and the Buddha went there on his journey 
to Kosambī at the invitation of Ghosita, Kukkuta and Pāvārika. He turned off the 
main road to visit Māgandiya.  </p>

<p><b>2. Māgandiya.</b> A Paribbājaka. The Buddha was once 
staying in the fire hut of the brahmin Bhāradvājaggotta at Kammāsadamma and 
Māgandiya came to the hut. Seeing the grass mat on which the Buddha slept at 
night, he inquired whose it was, and, on being told, he was very annoyed, 
calling the Buddha a rigid repressionist (bhunahu). Bhāradvāja protested, 
whereupon Māgandiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha’s face. The 
Buddha, aware of this conversation, entered the hut in the evening and had a 
discussion with Māgandiya, who ended by joining the Order, later becoming an 
arahant. M.i.502ff.; Mil.313.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.681) that this Māgandiya was 
the nephew of Māgandiya (1).</p>
