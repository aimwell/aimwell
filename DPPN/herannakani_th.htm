<p>He was the son of an official of the king of Kosala who 
turned bandit. On his father’s death he succeeded to his place. He was present 
when the Buddha accepted Jetavana, and, filled with wonder, he entered the 
Order, where he soon attained arahantship. Later he persuaded his brother too, 
with some difficulty, to become a monk.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a labourer (bhataka), 
and seeing the Buddha’s disciple, Sujāta, looking for rags for his robe, gave 
him half a garment (Thag.vs.145-6; ThagA.i.266f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Upaddhadussadāyaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.435f.</p>
