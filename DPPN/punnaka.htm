<p><b>1. Punnaka. </b>One Of the stallions of 
<a href="ekaraaja.htm" title="e/ekaraaja.htm">Ekarāja</a>. 
J.vi.135.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Punnaka. </b>One of the sixteen disciples of 
<a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvarī</a>, 
who visited the Buddha (SN. vs. 1006). His conversation with the Buddha is given 
in the Punnakamānavapucchā (Ibid., 1043 48). At the end of the interview Punnaka 
and his one thousand followers became arahants. SNA.ii.590.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Punnaka. </b>A Yakkha chief, nephew of 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> 
(J.vi.255). The story of how he won the Nāga maiden
<a href="irandatii.htm" title="i_/irandatii.htm">Irandatī</a> is related in the 
<a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm" title="vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm">Vidhurapandita Jātaka</a>. In his previous birth he had been a young man 
named Kaccāyana in the Anga country. J.vi.273f.; he is also called Kātiyāna 
(Kaccāna). He is also referred to as Punnakaraja (J.iv.182). He is evidently 
identical with the Yakkha chieftain mentioned in the 
<a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Ātānitiya Sutta</a> (D.iii.204) 
among those to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in times of tribulation. 
The gem used by Punnaka as a stake in his gambling with Koravya was such that 
all things in the world could be seen in it (MT. 552). The shout of victory 
uttered by Punnaka when he defeated Koravya was one of the four shouts heard 
throughout <a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>. SNA.i.223.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Punnaka. </b>A king of twenty five kappas ago, a 
former birth of Asanabodhiya Thera. Ap.i.111.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Punnaka. </b>Punnaka was evidently not a name of 
high station. E.g., J.vi.273.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Punnaka.</b> See also s.v. <a href="punna.htm" title="pu/punna.htm">Punna</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Punnaka Jātaka.</b> Another name for the 
<a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm" title="vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm">Vidhurapandita 
Jātaka</a>.</p>
