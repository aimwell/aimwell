<p>Daughter of the king of Devaputta.
</p>
<p>Once she was a bitch in 
Kakubandhakandara and a sāmanera, Tissa, had given her a little food. Later, 
when Tissa was on his way to the Bodhi-tree (in Gayā) she saw him, and, 
remembering her past existence, invited him to the palace and entertained him. 
Later she built a vihāra for him, where he attained arahantship. Ras.i.103f.</p>
