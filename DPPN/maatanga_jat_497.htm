  <h2>Mātanga Jātaka (No. 497)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in a Candāla village outside 
Benares and was named Mātanga. One day, when Ditthamangalikā, the daughter of a 
rich merchant, was on her way to the park with a group of friends, she saw 
Mātanga coming towards the city, and thinking the sight inauspicious, washed her 
eyes with perfumed water and turned back home. Her companions, annoyed at being 
deprived of their fun, beat Mātanga and left him senseless. On recovering 
consciousness, he determined to get Ditthamangalikā as wife and lay down outside 
her father’s house refusing to move. Seven days he lay thus until her relations, 
fearing the ignominy of having a candāla die at their door, gave Ditthamangalikā 
to him as wife.</p>
<p>Knowing her pride to be quelled by this act, Mātanga 
decided to bring her great honour. He, therefore, retired into the forest and in 
seven days, won supernatural power. On his return he told her to proclaim abroad 
that her husband was not a candāla but Mahābrahmā, and that seven days later, on 
the night of the full moon, he would come to her, breaking through the moon’s 
disk. She did as he said and so it happened. The people thenceforth honoured her 
as a goddess; the water in which she washed her feet was used for the coronation 
of kings, and in one single day she received eighteen crores from those who were 
allowed the privilege of saluting her. Mātanga touched her navel with his thumb, 
and, knowing that she had conceived a son, admonished her to be vigilant and 
returned to the moon.</p>
<p>The son was born in the pavilion, which the people had 
constructed for the use of Ditthamangalikā, and was therefore called Mandavya,. 
At the age of sixteen he knew all the Vedas and fed sixteen thousand brahmins 
daily. On a feast day Mātanga came to him, thinking to turn him from his wrong 
doctrines, but Mandavya failed to recognize him and had him cast out by his 
servants, Bhandakucchi, Upajjhāya, and Upajotiya. The gods of the city thereupon 
grew angry and twisted the necks of Mandavya and all the brahmins so that their 
eyes looked over their shoulders. When Ditthamangalikā heard of this she sought 
Mātanga, who had left his footsteps so that she might know where he was. He 
asked her to sprinkle on the brahmins water in which were dissolved the leavings 
of his food; to Mandavya himself was given some of the food. On recovering and 
seeing the plight of the brahmins, he realized his error. The brahmins 
recovered, but were shunned by their colleagues; they left the country and went 
to live in the kingdom of Mejjha.</p>
<p>On the bank of the Vettavatī lived a brahmin called 
Jātimanta, very proud of his birth. Mātanga went thither to humble the pride of 
Jātimanta and lived higher up stream. One day he nibbled a tooth stick and threw 
it into the river, where, lower down, it got entangled in Jātimanta’s hair. He 
was greatly annoyed and went up stream, where he found Mātanga and told him 
that, if he stayed there any longer, at the end of seven days his head would 
split into seven pieces. On the seventh day Mātanga stopped the sun from rising. 
On discovering the cause, the people dragged Jātimanta to Mātanga and made him 
ask forgiveness, falling at Mātanga’s feet. Jātimanta’s head was covered with a 
lump of clay, which was immersed in the water as the sun rose.</p>
<p>Mātanga then went to the kingdom of Mejjha, where the 
exiled brahmins reported against him to the king, saying that he was a juggler 
and a mountebank. The king’s messengers surprised Mātanga as he was eating his 
food beside a well, and cut off his head. He was born in the Brahma world. The 
gods were angry and wiped out the whole kingdom of Mejjha by pouring on it 
torrents of hot ashes. Before his meeting with Ditthamangalikā the Bodhisatta 
was a mongoose tamer (kondadamaka). But in SNA.i.186, he is called a 
sopākajīvika.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the attempt of King 
Udena (q.i) to torture Pindolabhāradvāja. Udena is identified with Mandavya. 
J.iv.375 90; the story is found also at SNA.i.184 93, with alterations in 
certain details&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., for Vettavatī we have Bandhumatī; see also 
Mil.123ff.</p>
