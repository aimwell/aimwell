  <h2>Bilārikosiya Jātaka (No.450)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant of Benares who 
built an almonry and distributed much alms. On his deathbed, he asked his son to 
continue with the alms, and, after death, he was reborn as Sakka. His son 
followed him and became the god Canda. His son Suriya, Suriya’s son Mātalī, and 
Mātalī’s son Pañcasikha, all followed in the same path. But the sixth of the 
line, Bilārikosiya, became a miser and burnt the almonry. Sakka and the others 
then came separately, in the guise of brahmins, to visit him and to ask for 
alms. Kosiya refused their request until each one uttered a little verse, when 
he was asked to enter and receive a small gift. Kosiya asked the servant to give 
each a little unhusked rice. This was refused, and in the end he was obliged to 
give the brahmins cooked rice, meant for cows. Each swallowed a mouthful, but 
then let it stick in his throat and lay down as if dead. Kosiya, very 
frightened, had a meal prepared, which he put into their bowls, and then, 
calling in the passers by, asked them to note how the brahmins, in their greed, 
had eaten too much and died. But the brahmins arose, spat out the rice, and 
publicly shamed Kosiya by showing up his miserliness and the manner in which he 
had disgraced his ancestors. Then each revealed his identity and departed. 
Bilārikosiya mended his ways and became most generous.</p>
<p>The story was related to a monk reputed for his great 
generosity; he would not even drink a cup of water without sharing it. The monk 
is identified with Bilārikosiya, and the Buddha related the story in order to 
show how he had changed his ways. Sāriputta was Canda, Moggallāna Suriya, 
Kassapa Mātalī and Ānanda Pañcasikha. J.iv.62 9.</p>
