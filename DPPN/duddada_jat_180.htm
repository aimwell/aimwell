<p>v.l. Dudda, Dudada. </p>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a brahmin of 
Kāsi and, after being educated in Takkasilā, became an ascetic in the Himālaya. 
When he and his fellow ascetics visited <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> for salt and seasoning, the 
people gathered together and gave them food. The story was told in reference to 
two young men who made a collection in Sāvatthi to feed the Buddha and his monks 
(J.ii.85f).</p>
