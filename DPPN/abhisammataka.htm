<p>A yakkha chieftain. Upavāna Thera, who 
at the time of Padumuttara Buddha had been a very poor man, set up his 
uttarāsanga as a banner on the shrine erected over the relics of the Buddha.
</p>
<p>Abhisammataka had been appointed by the 
devas as guardian of the offerings at the shrine, and he went round the shrine 
three times carrying the banner, while he himself remained invisible.
