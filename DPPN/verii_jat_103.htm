<p>The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant, and one day, 
while on his way home from a village where he had collected his dues, he noticed 
that there were robbers about. He, therefore, urged his oxen on to the top of 
their speed and reached home safely.</p>
<p>The story was told to Anāthapindika, who had a similar 
experience. J.i.412f.</p>
