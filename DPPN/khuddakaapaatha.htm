  <h2>Khuddakapātha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the fifteen books of the Khuddaka 
Nikāya, generally mentioned first in this list (E.g., DA.i.17).
</p>
<p>Its rightful claim to be included as 
part of the Tipitaka was disputed both by the Dīghabhānakas and the 
Majjhimabhānakas (DA.i.15). It is generally 
acknowledged (for a discussion see Law, Pāli Lit., i.7f; 34f) that the work is 
of later composition and that it contains extracts from earlier works. It may 
have been composed in Ceylon, and it is significant that its first mention as a 
canonical book should occur only in the commentaries. It is not mentioned even 
in the Milindapañha.</p>
<p>The book consists of nine sections on 
texts: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Saranattaya, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Dasasikkhā-pada, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Dvattimsākāra, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Kumārapañha, </li>
</ul>
<p>and five suttas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Mangala, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Ratana, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Tirokudda, </li>
  <li>
  <p>Nidhikanda, and </li>
  <li>
  <p>Metta</li>
</ul>
<p>- all found 
elsewhere in the canon.</p>
<p>According to the Commentary the book 
derives its name from the first four texts, which are shorter than the remaining 
five. KhpA.13. </p>
<p>The Commentary was written by 
Buddhaghosa. See also Gv.59, 68.</p>
