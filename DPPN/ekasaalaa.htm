<p>A Brahmin village in the Kosala kingdom. 
The Buddha once stayed there, and when a large congregation of the laity were 
listening to him, Māra, thinking to darken their intelligence, suggested to him 
that he should not teach others. The Buddha refuted the suggestion of Māra, who 
retired discomfited. S.i.111.</p>
