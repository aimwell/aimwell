<p>A mountain in Rohana; near it was the 
village of Kitti (Mhv.xxiii.55). There was a monastery on Kotapabbatta called 
the Kotapabbata-vihāra. This was the residence of the Sāmanera who was 
afterwards born as Dutthagāmanī (Mhv.xxii.25); also of Mahā-Summa Thera 
(Mhv.xxiii.61), of Asubhakammika-Tissa and of his teacher Mahā-Tissa (MT.553). 
The Vihāra was near Mahāgāma (MT.553).</p>
<p>The Visuddhi Magga (p.292) mentions an 
Elder, Tissa, of Kota (Koti) pabbata, who, having attained arahantship through 
meditation on breathing, was able to limit the term of his life. According to 
the Dhammapada Commentary (iv.50), an Elder named Anula lived in the monastery 
during the time of Dutthagāmanī, and the village Bhokkanta, residence of Sumanā, 
wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in its vicinity. It was probably the same as 
Gotapabbata (q.v.) (See Mhv.xxxv.124; MT.667). The Nāgalena was in the 
Kotapabbata-vihāra (DA.ii.695).</p>
