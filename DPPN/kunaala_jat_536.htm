  <h2>Kunāla Jātaka (No.536)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Kunāla, king of the Citrakokilas, though 
well served by his hen birds, always despised them and found fault with them. 
The king of the Phussakokilas, Punnamukha, on the other hand, always sang the 
praises of his escort. One day the two kings met, and Punnamukha asked Kunāla 
why he was not more gracious to his ladies. “Because I know too much about 
women,” was the answer; but Punnamakha was not in a mood to discuss the matter 
any more. </p>
<p>Later, Punnamukha fell ill, and his hen 
birds deserted him and came to Kunāla. He drove them away, ministered to 
Punnamukha, and cheered him. Some time after, Kunāla, seated on the Manosilātala 
in Himavā (according to Buddhaghosa, D.ii.675, this was on the banks of the 
Kunāladaha), started to tell his friend of the wickedness of women. Hearing of 
this, many inhabitants of numerous worlds came to listen to him, among them 
Ānanda, king of the vultures, and the ascetic Nārada. Many were the instances 
given by Kunāla to illustrate the deceitfulness, ingratitude and immorality of 
women — among them the stories of </p>

  <p>Saccatapāvī</li>

  <p><a href="pingiyani.htm" title="pu/pingiyani.htm">Pingiyānī</a>, Brahmadatta’s mother who sinned with 
  Pañcālacanda</li>
  <li>
  <p>the queen Kinnarā</li>
  <li>
  <p><a href="pancapapa.htm" title="pa/pancapapa.htm">Pañcapāpā</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Kunāla’s diatribe was followed by 
Ānanda’s, and his by Nārada’s, each claiming to speak from facts within their 
knowledge. </p>
<p>In the stories related by Kunāla, the 
bird-king is identified with one of the characters concerned in each story, so 
that he was able to speak with authority. Thus he was </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Ajjuna, one of Kanha’s husbands;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>the goldsmith in the story of 
  Saccatapāvī; </li>
  <li>
  <p>the Garuda in Kākātī’s tale; 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Chalangakumāra, who misconducted 
  himself with Kurangavī; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Pañcālacanda, lover of Brahmadatta’s 
  mother; </li>
  <li>
  <p>the chaplain, also called Pañcālacanda, 
  who saved Kinnarā from her husband’s wrath; </li>
  <li>
  <p>Baka, one time husband of Pañcapāpā;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>and Brahmadatta, husband of Pingiyānī.</li>
</ul>
<p>Punnamukha is identified with Udāyī, the 
vulture-king with Ānanda and Nārada with Sāriputta.</p>
<p>The preaching of the Kunāla Jātaka was 
followed by that of the Mahāsamaya Sutta.</p>
<p>This Jātaka was related in order to 
destroy the discontent that rose in the hearts of the Sākiyan youths, kinsmen of 
the Buddha, who, having entered the Order, were troubled by the thought of the 
wives they had left behind. The Buddha therefore took them to the Himalaya, 
showed them the magnificent beauty of the region, particularly the miraculous 
splendours of the Kunāladaha, and there preached to them. At the end of the 
Jātaka they all became arahants. We are told that that very day they became 
arahants (J.v.412-56; also DA.ii.674ff; AA.i.173).
