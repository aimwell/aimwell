  <h4>1. Mangala</h4>

</ul>
<p>The third of the twenty four Buddhas.</p>
<p>He was born sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas ago in the Uttaramadhura Park, in 
the city of Uttara, his father being a khattiya named Uttara and his mother 
Uttarā. It is said that from the day of her conception, an aura shed its rays 
night and day from her body, to a distance of eighty hands — 
hence his name. He surpassed other Buddhas in glory of body. In his last birth 
as a human being (corresponding to that of Vessantara in the case of Gotama) he 
lived with his family as an ascetic. A man eating yakkha, named Kharadāthika, 
took from him his two children and ate them in his presence, “crunching them as 
though they were yams,” while the blood dripped from his mouth. (It is probably 
this incident, which is referred to at J.iv.13). The Bodhisatta stood firm in 
his resolve and repented not of his gift to the yakkha, but registered a desire 
that in future births his body should emit light as bright as the blood which 
flowed down the yakkha’s face. In a previous birth, Mangala paid honour to the 
cetiya of a Buddha by wrapping his body in cloth drenched with oil, setting fire 
to it and walking round the cetiya throughout the night, carrying on his head a 
golden bowl filled with scented oil and lighted with one thousand wicks. Not a 
hair on his body suffered damage.</p>
<p>For nine thousand years Mangala lived in the household in 
three palaces, Yasavā, Sucimā and Sirimā, with his wife Yasavatī, by whom he had 
one son, Sīvala. He left the world on a horse and practised austerities for 
eight months. Just before his Enlightenment he ate a meal of milk rice given by 
a maiden, Uttarā, daughter of Uttarasetthi in Uttaragāma; an Ājīvaka, named 
Uttara, gave him grass for his seat. His Bodhi was a Nāga tree. After his 
Enlightenment he lived for ninety thousand years, and for all that time the aura 
from his body spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, shutting out 
sun, moon and stars. People knew the times and the seasons by the cries of the 
birds and the blooming of the flowers.</p>
<p>Mangala’s first sermon was preached in the Sirivaruttama 
Grove, near Sirivaddha. His chief disciples among men were Sudeva and Dhammasena, 
and his chief nuns Sīvalā and Asokā. Pālita was his 
constant attendant (BuA.124 calls him Uttara). Nanda and Visākha were his chief 
patrons among lay men and Anulā and Sutanā among lay women. In Mangala’s time 
the Bodhisatta was the brahmin Suruci (q.v.). Mangala’s body was eighty cubits 
high; he held three assemblies: the first at the preaching of the Dhammacakka, 
the second at Cittanagara, when he preached to Sunanda, king of Surabhinagara, 
and his son Anurāja, and the third at Mekhala to Sudeva and Dhammasena who later 
became his chief disciples.</p>
<p>He died in the park of Vessara, and a cetiya, thirty 
leagues high, was erected over his ashes (Bu.iv.1ff.; BuA.115ff.; J.i.30 ff.; 
the particulars found in Mtu.i.248 50, are slightly different). It is said 
(Bu.iv.29) that all Mangala Buddha’s personal disciples attained arahantship 
before their death.</p>

occasion, by his iddhi power, he obtained fruit which grew on the jambu tree
