  <h2>Mahā-atthakathā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The oldest and most important of the Commentaries on the 
Tipitaka, brought, according to tradition, to Ceylon by Mahinda, who translated 
it into Singhalese (Cv.xxxvii.228f). It thus came to be called the 
Sīhalatthakathā. Besides exegetical material on the Pāli Canon, it contained 
also historical materials on which were later based the Pāli Chronicles, the 
Mahāvamsa and the Dīpavamsa. For a description see Geiger’s Dipavamsa and 
Mahavamsa, pp. 44, 63, etc. </p>
<p>The Mahā-atthakathā was the chief source from which 
Buddhaghosa drew his materials for his Commentaries and is often referred to in 
his works, particularly in the Samantapāsādikā. E.g., Sp.i.2; ii.494; 265; 
iii.537, 616, 617, 627, 701, 716, 718, 726; iv. 744, 776, 783, 817, 863, 914, 
923; DhSA.157; DA.i.180, etc. </p>
<p>The Mahā-atthakathā was in charge of the monks of the 
Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura. It was superseded by the Commentaries of 
Buddhaghosa, Dhammapāla and others, and is not now extant. It is often referred 
to merely as Atthakathā. E.g., VibhA.56, 155, 200, etc.</p>
