<p>One of the countries to which Asoka sent 
missionaries after the Third Council. The leader of the mission was Yonaka 
Dhammarakkhitta (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.7). He preached to the people the 
Aggikkhandopamā Sutta and 37,000 people embraced the new faith, a thousand men 
and even more women entering the Order (Mhv.xii.34-6; Sp.i.67). </p>
<p>The country comprises the territory of 
Northern Gujarat, Kāthiāwar, Kachch and Sindh. Fleet J.R.A.S. 1910, p.427; 
Bhandarkar in his Early History of Dekkan puts it in North Konkan (p.23); see 
also Burgess: Arch. Reports ii.131. </p>
<p>According to Hsouien Thsang, the country 
seems to comprise Sindh, Western Rājaputāna, Cutch, Gujarat and a portion of the 
adjoining coast on the lower bank of the Narmadā. Cunningham Anct. Geog. of 
India, notes, p.690; and Law: Early Geography 56ff. </p>
<p>Probably Buddhism was known in Aparanta 
during the time of the Buddha himself. Dutt: Early Hist. of Bsm. p.190; Dvy., 
pp.45ff; but the reference is to Sunāparanta.</p>
<p>It is said that when Mandhātā brought 
all the four continents under his sway people from the three other continents 
came over to Jambudīpa and lived there. When the king died they found themselves 
unable to get back, and begged his minister to allow them to start settlements 
in Jambudīpa itself. He agreed, and the settlement of those who had come from 
Aparagoyāna was for that reason called Aparanta (DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) (Aparantaka).</p>
