<p>A village in Ceylon. A young novice 
named Tissa of Pa침caggalalena, travelling through the air, saw the daughter of 
the smith of Girig캐ma bathing in a lotus pond with five of her friends, and 
heard them singing aloud. He was so fascinated by her that he lost his power of 
flight. SNA.i.70; ApA.i.128.</p>
