<p>The family of the brahmin of Sāketa mentioned in the 
Commentary to the Jarā Sutta. </p>
<p>He and his wife had been the parents of the Buddha in five 
hundred births, and when they saw him at Sāketa they greeted him like a long 
lost son. Thenceforth they were known as Buddhapitā and Buddhamātā and their 
family as Buddhakula. SNA.ii.531ff.; see also the Sāketa Jātaka and Avadāna 
Sataka ii. 41.</p>
