  <h2>Kālaka Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached by the Buddha at Kālakārāma in 
Sāketa when he visited the city at the request of Cūla-Subhaddā (AA.ii.482f).</p>
<p>The Tathāgata knows and comprehends 
whatsoever is seen, heard, comprised, attained, searched into, etc., in the 
whole world, but he is not subject to it (A.ii.24f).</p>
<p>This sutta is sometimes referred to as 
the Kālakārāma Sutta (E.g., ThagA.i.284). It is said that at the conclusion of 
the Kālakārāma Sutta the earth trembled, as though bearing witness to the 
Buddha’s statement (DA.i.130-1).</p>
<p>It was this sutta which helped 
Mahārakkhita to convert the country of the Yonakas (Sp.i.67; Mhv.xii.39; 
Mbv.114; Dpv.viii.9).  </p>
<p>The sutta was also preached by Kāla Buddharakkhita at the 
Cetiyapabbata to a concourse of people, among whom King Tissa (probably Saddhā-Tissa) 
was also present. MA.i.470.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kālaka(-bhikkhu) Sutta.-A discourse 
delivered by the Buddha (Kālakam bhikkhum ārabbha — see Kālaka 4). </p>
<p>It deals with ten dispositions which if 
present in a monk prevent his being loved or respected, and from being apt to 
meditate or to lead an ascetic and lonely life, and with the ten opposite 
dispositions. A.v.164ff. On the name see A.v.176, n.7; also GS.v.110, n.1.</p>
