<p>The mother of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (D.ii.52; see Thomas: op. cit., 
25).  </p>
<p>Her father was the Sākiyan <a href="anjana.htm" title="ay/anjana.htm">Añjana</a> of 
<a href="devadaha.htm" title="d/devadaha.htm">Devadaha</a>, son of Devadahasakka, and her 
mother <a href="yasodharaa.htm" title="y/yasodharaa.htm">Yasodharā</a>, daughter of 
<a href="jayasena.htm" title="j/jayasena.htm">Jayasena</a>. (Mhv.ii.17ff.; elsewhere her father is 
called <a href="suppabuddha.htm" title="s/suppabuddha.htm">Mahā Suppabuddha </a>(ThigA.141), while the Apadāna (ii.538) gives the name 
of her mother as Sulakkhanā).</p>
<p><a href="dandapaanii.htm" title="d/dandapaanii.htm">Dandapāni</a> and <a href="suppabuddha.htm" title="s/suppabuddha.htm">
Suppabuddha</a> were her brothers, and <a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā 
Pajāpatī</a> her sister. Both the sisters were married to 
<a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a> in their youth, 
but it was not till Māyā was between forty and fifty that the Buddha was born 
(Vibhā.278). She had all the qualities necessary for one who was to bear the 
exalted rank of being the mother of the Buddha: she was not too passionate, she 
did not take intoxicants, she had practiced the pāramī for one hundred thousand 
kappas, and had not, since her birth, violated the five sīlā. On the day of her 
conception she kept her fast, and in her sleep that night she had the following 
dream: the four Mahārāja gods took her in her bed to Himavā and placed her under 
a sāla tree on Manosilātala. Then their wives came and bathed her in the 
<a href="anotatta.htm" title="ay/anotatta.htm">Anotatta Lake</a> and clad her in divine robes. They then led her into a golden 
palace and laid her on a divine couch; there the Bodhisatta, in the form of a 
white elephant, holding a white lotus in his gleaming trunk, entered into her 
right side. This was on the day of the Uttarāsālhanakkhatta, after a festival 
lasting seven days, in which she had already taken part.</p>
<p>From the day of her conception she was guarded by the Four 
Regent Gods; she felt no desire for men, and the child in her womb could be seen 
from outside. At the end of the tenth month she wished to return to her people 
in Devadaha, but, on her way thither, she stopped at the sāla grove in 
<a href="lumbini.htm" title="l/lumbini.htm">Lumbinī</a> 
and there her child was born as she stood holding on to the branch of a sāla 
tree (J.i.49ff). Seven days later Māyā died and was reborn as a male in the 
<a href="tusita.htm" title="t/tusita.htm">Tusita</a> world, under the name of Māyādevaputta (Thag.vss.533f.; ThagA.i.502).  </p>
<p>The 
Buddha visited <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> immediately after the performance of the Twin Miracle 
at the foot of the Gandamba tree, on the full moon day of Āsālha, and there, 
during the three months of the rainy season, the Buddha stayed, preaching the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother (who came there to listen to him), seated on 
Sakka’s Pandukambalasilāsana, at the foot of the Pāricchattaka tree. (It is said 
that, during this time, at certain intervals, the Buddha would return to earth, 
leaving a seated image of himself in Tāvatimsa to continue the preaching while 
he attended to his bodily needs, begging alms in <a href="uttarakuru.htm" title="u/uttarakuru.htm">Uttarakuru</a> and eating his food 
on the banks of Anotatta, where <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> waited on him and learnt of what he 
had been preaching to the devas.) (DhSA.i.15; DhA.iii.216f)</p>
<p>The Commentaries (UdA.276f ) state the view, held by some, 
that had Māyā been alive the Buddha would not have shown such reluctance to 
bestow ordination on women. This view, says <a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> is erroneous. It would 
have made no difference, for it is the dhammatā of all Buddhas that women shall 
be ordained, but subject to certain important restrictions. The mothers of all 
Buddhas die very soon after the birth of their son, because no other child is 
fit to be conceived in the same womb as a Buddha.</p>
<p>Māyā is mentioned in several Jātakas as the mother of the 
Bodhisatta&nbsp;-&nbsp; e.g., in  </p>

<p>According to some contexts, after her birth as Phusatī in the Vessantara Jātaka, 
Māyā became one of the daughters of <a href="kikii.htm" title="ku/kikii.htm">King Kikī</a>.</p>
<p>Māyā’s resolve to be the mother of a Buddha was formed 
ninety one kappas ago in the time of Vipassī Buddha (J.vi.480f). She was then 
the elder daughter of King Bandhumā. One of the king’s vassals sent him a piece 
of priceless sandalwood and a golden wreath, worth one hundred thousand. The 
sandalwood the king gave to his elder daughter and the wreath to the younger. 
The elder powdered the sandalwood and took it in a golden casket to the Buddha. 
Some of the powder she offered to the Buddha to be rubbed on his body, and the 
rest she scattered in his cell. It was the sight of the Buddha’s golden body 
that inspired her with the desire to be the mother of such a being. Her sister 
later became <a href="uracchadaa.htm" title="u/uracchadaa.htm">Uracchadā</a>.</p>
