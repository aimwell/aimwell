<p>A Yakkha who worried Ceylon in the time of Sirisanghabodhi. All those who saw 
him or heard of him developed a fever (jararoga) accompanied by redness of the 
eyes and died of the disease, the Yakkha devouring their bodies. </p>
<p>The king heard of this, and, by the power of his goodness, compelled the 
Yakkha to come to him, and persuaded him to abandon his evil influence. In 
return, the king promised to have offerings (bali) placed for the Yakkha at the 
entrance to every village. Mhv.xxxvi.82ff.; Attanagaluvamsa, p.16.</p>
