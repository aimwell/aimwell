  <h2>Vajjī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name of a country and of its people. It was one of the 
sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a>. The inhabitants appear to have consisted of 
several confederate clans of whom the <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavī</a> and the
<a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videhā</a> were 
the chief. </p>
<p>A passage in the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.519) — 
which states that among those responsible for the administration of justice in 
the Vajji country (see Licchavī) were the Atthakulakā — 
has given rise to the conjecture that Atthakulakā meant heads of eight clans 
composing the Vajjian confederacy. There is no other evidence regarding the 
number of the clans. The Atthakulakā were probably a judicial committee.</p>
<p>As time went on the Licchavī became the most powerful of 
these clans (Licchavī Vajjiratthavāsīhi pasatthā) (E.g., MA.i.394), and the 
names Vajjī and Licchavī were often synonymous. See Licchavī; in the 
Trikandasesa, quoted by Cunningham (AGI. 509), Licchavi, Vaideha and Tirabhukti 
were synonymous. In one passage (A.iii.76) the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a 
band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, 
is represented as saying, “These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians” (bhavissanti 
Yajjī). This probably only means that there was great hope of these young men 
becoming true Vaijians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the 
Buddha, conditions which ensured their prosperity. But see G. S.iii.62, n.1 and 
3.</p>
<p><a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> was the capital of the Licchavis and
<a href="mithilaa.htm" title="me_mu/mithilaa.htm">Mithilā</a> of the 
Videhas. In the time of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, 
though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.</p>
<p>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the 
Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this 
to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them 
by himself in the <a href="sarandada.htm" title="sa/sarandada.htm">Sārandada Cetiya</a>. The details of this teaching, and various 
other matters connected with the Vajji, are given under 
<a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavī</a>. But 
soon after the Buddha’s death, (three years after the 
Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli, according to <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a>, 
DA.ii.522) <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, 
with the help of his minister <a href="vassakaara.htm" title="va/vassakaara.htm">Vassakāra</a>, sowed dissension among the Vajjians and conquered their territory.</p>
<p>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian 
country, the usual route being through <a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>,
<a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Malla</a>, Vajji, <a href="kaasi.htm" title="ka/kaasi.htm">Kāsi</a>, 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, and 
thus back (See, e.g., S.v.348), and he preached to the people, mostly in the
<a href="kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm" title="ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm">Kūtāgārasālā</a> in 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, 
are mentioned <a href="ukkaacelaa.htm" title="u/ukkaacelaa.htm">Ukkācelā</a>, 
<a href="kotigaama.htm" title="ku/kotigaama.htm">Kotigāma</a> (see, e.g., J.ii.232, where it is called a 
village of the Vajjians, on the Ganges), Nādikā (in which were Giñjakāvasatha 
and <a href="gosingasaala.htm" title="g/gosingasaala.htm">Gosingasālavana</a>), Beluvagāma (or Veluvagāma), Bhandagāma, Bhogagāma 
and Hatthigāma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of <a href="channa.htm" title="c/channa.htm">Channa</a>, is also mentioned as a 
village of the Vajjians (S.iv.59). The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian 
territory (Ud.iii.3).</p>
<p>In one context (UdA., p. 382) Dhammapāla describes Udena 
as Vajjirājā. This is probably a mistake, for nowhere is Udena, who was king of 
the Vatsas (or Vamsas), called the king of the Vajjis. The Vajjī are mentioned 
in the <a href="mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm" title="maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm">Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka</a>. It is significant that the first great 
schism in the Buddhist Order arose in Vajji, when the 
<a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjiputtakā</a> 
brought forward their Ten Points. Even during the Buddha’s lifetime some monks 
of Vajji joined <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> (Vin.ii.199f). </p>
<p>According to <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a>, (Beal: op. 
cit., 77) who visited it, the Vajji (Vriji) country was broad from east to west 
and narrow from north to south. The people of the neighbouring countries were 
called Samvajji, or United Vajjis. For details see Cunningham, AGI. 512ff.&nbsp;

<p>The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the name Vajjī. See 
<a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavī</a>.</p>
