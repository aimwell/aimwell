<p>1. Dāthāppabhuti.-Father of King 
Silākāla. He was a Lambakanna and served under Kassapa I. Later he quarrelled 
with the king and retired to the Mereliya district. Cv.xxxix.44.</p>
<p>2. Dāthāppabhuti.-Second son of King 
Silākāla. He was given the post of Malayarājā with the province of Dakkhinadesa 
and the care of the sea coast. On the death of Silākāla he murdered his younger 
brother, Upatissa, and became king, but his elder brother, Moggallāna, marched 
against him and challenged him to single combat. Dāthāppabhuti was vanquished in 
this conquest and committed suicide. He ruled for six months and six days (in 
537 A.C.). Cv.xli.33-53.</p>
<p>3. Dāthāppabhuti.-An ādipāda (royal 
prince), contemporary of Aggabodhi I. When Jotipāla defeated the Vetullavādins, 
Dāthāppabhuti was so incensed that he raised his arm to strike the thera, but an 
ulcer immediately appeared on it. Dāthāppabhuti refused to ask Jotipāla’s 
forgiveness and died soon after. Cv.xlii.36f.</p>
