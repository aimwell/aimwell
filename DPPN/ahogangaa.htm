<p>A mountain in North India, on the Upper 
Ganges. There, for some time, lived the Thera <a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta Sānavāsi</a>, and it was 
there that <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa Kākandakaputta</a> saw him. The meeting of arahants to discuss what 
measures should be taken against the Vesālī monks was also held there, and at 
the meeting were present monks from the Western country and from 
Avanti-Dakkhināpatha (Vin.ii.298-9). </p>
<p>
<a href="moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm" title="me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm">Moggaliputta</a> lived in Ahogangā all alone 
for seven years, prior to the Third Council for which he was awaiting the right 
time (Mhv.v.233; see also Vin. Texts, ii.146, n.1. The Mbv., p.106, says upari 
Gangāya; see also Sp.i.57). The Mahāvamsa describes it as being “further up the 
Ganges” (uddham Gangāya).</p>
<p>
<a href="moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm" title="me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th.htm">Moggaliputta Tissa</a> came from Ahogangā to 
<a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaliputta</a> on a raft. Sp.i.57.</p>
