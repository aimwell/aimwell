</ul>
<p>Pupil of Uttarajīva of Pagan. He went to Ceylon with his 
teacher, received the higher ordination there, and lived in the Mahāvihāra for 
some years. Among his works are the Kaccāyana suttaniddesa, the Sankhepavannanā, 
the Sīmālankāra, the Vinayagūlhatthadīpanī, the Nāmācāradīpanī (on ethics), the 
Ganthisāra (an anthology of texts), and the Mātukatthadīpanī and 
Patthānaganānaya (both on Abhidhamma topics).</p>
<p>On Chapata’s return to Burma, he brought four companions 
from Ceylon&nbsp;&nbsp; Rāhula, Ānanda, Sīvalī and Tāmalinda — 
and, with their help, he founded the Sīhalasangha in Pagan, followers of the 
Mahāvihāra tradition. King Narapatisithu gave them his patronage, but extended 
it to other sects as well, and the Sīhalasangha, therefore, remained only as one 
sect among several in Burma. Chapata lived in the twelfth century. Gv.64, 74; 
Sās.65, 74; Svd.1247 f,; Bode, 17, 18, 19.</p>
