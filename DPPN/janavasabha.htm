<p><b>Janavasabha.</b>-A Yakkha, a later birth of 
King <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>. He appears before the Buddha at the
<a href="ginjakaavasatha.htm" title="g/ginjakaavasatha.htm">Giñjakāvasatha</a> in Ñātikā and 
declares his identity. He is on his way as a messenger from 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> to Virūlhaka and reports to the Buddha an account of an assembly of the devas in 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> which had taken place some time earlier, and which account he claims 
to have heard from Vessavana. </p>
<p>See Janavasabha Sutta (below).  </p>
<p>Janavasabha is a Sotāpanna 
and expresses a wish to be a Sakadāgāmi. He says he remembers fourteen lives in 
all. D.ii.205f, 207, 214; cp. Janesabha.</p>

<p><b>Janavasabha Sutta.</b>-<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> asks the 
Buddha at <a href="ginjakaavasatha.htm" title="g/ginjakaavasatha.htm">Giñjakāvasatha</a> questions concerning followers of the Buddha in 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>. The Yakkha, Janavasabha (above), appears and says he was once King 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> 
and is now reborn into the communion of King <a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a>. He then proceeds to 
relate a report he had just heard from Vessavana of an assembly of the gods held 
in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> many years earlier, on the full-moon day of Āsālhi. 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> presided 
and there were present also the Four Regent Gods. All the devas rejoiced that 
their numbers were increasing because so many on earth were following the 
teachings of the Buddha. Then there appeared in the assembly the Brahmā
<a href="sanankumara.htm" title="sa/sanankumara.htm">Sanankumāra</a> in the guise of 
<a href="pancasikha.htm" title="pa/pancasikha.htm">Pañcasikha</a>; assuming thirty-three forms, he took his 
place by each god of Tāvatimsa and confirmed the glad tidings of the increasing 
number of devas. He then told them of the Four Ways of Iddhi and the Three 
Avenues of Bliss as taught by the Buddha, and of the seven samādhi-parikkhārā. 
Then they all sang the praises of the Buddha. D.ii.200ff. (gr. D.18)</p>
