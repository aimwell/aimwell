<hr>
<p><b>1. Vāsetthī. </b>A brahnninee, wife of King Esukī’s 
chaplain. She was the mother of Hatthipāla (the Bodhisatta), and is identified 
with Mahāmāyā. J.iv.483, 491.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vāsetthī Theri. </b>She was born in Vesāli, and 
after being happily married bore a son. The child died very young, and his 
mother was mad with grief. One day she ran away from home, and, in the course of 
her wanderings, came to Mithilā, where she saw the Buddha, who calmed her grief. 
He taught her the Doctrine and had her ordained at her own request. She soon 
after became an arahant. </p>
<p>The story of her child’s death and her subsequent history, 
are contained in Thig.vs.133 8; see also ThigA.124f.</p>
<p>It is said* that the brahmin 
Sujāta, father of Sundarī (q.v.), met Vāsetthī (probably in Benares), and, 
hearing her story, himself sought the Buddha at Mithilā where he joined the 
Order, becoming an arahant at the end of three days.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* Thig. 312-24; ThigA.228f; according to Thig.312 
  Vāsetthī would seem to have lost “seven children,” but the Commentary explains 
  this as a rhetorical phrase.</p>
