<p>Dhanañjaya, king of Indapattana, was 
wont to neglect his old warriors and to show favour only to newcomers. The 
result was that he once suffered defeat in a rebellion. On his return from the 
battle he consulted his chaplain Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta), who told him 
of a goatherd of yore, called Dhūmakāri. Once, when Dhumakāri was tending his 
goats, a herd of golden deer came from the Himālaya, and he looked after them 
and neglected his own goats. In the autumn the deer went back to the mountains 
and he found that his goats had died of starvation.</p>
<p>The story was told to Pasenadi who, like 
Dhanañjaya, suffered a defeat, and for the same reasons. Pasenadi sought the 
consolation of the Buddha, who told him this ancient tale. See Appendix.</p>
<p>Dhanañjaya is identified with Ānanda and 
Dhumakāri with Pasenadi. J.iii.400ff.</p>
