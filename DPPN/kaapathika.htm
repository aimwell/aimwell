  <h2>Kāpathika (v.l. Kāpatika)</h2>

<p>A young brahmin, sixteen years old, well 
versed in the Vedas, and with his head shaven. He was “of good stock, well 
informed, a good speaker and a scholar of ability.” He visited the Buddha at 
Opasāda, where he interrupted a conversation which the Buddha was holding with 
some aged brahmins; they rebuked him for interrupting his elders, but Cankī 
(q.v.), who happened to arrive at that moment, interceded on his behalf. The 
Buddha, knowing that Kāpathika had questions to ask of him, gave him an 
opportunity for so doing, and there followed a discussion on various points, 
detailed in the Cankī Sutta. At the end of the discussion the youth declared 
himself a disciple of the Buddha (M.ii.168ff). In the Sutta the Buddha addresses 
Kāpathika as Bhāradvāja, perhaps because he belonged to that gotta.</p>
