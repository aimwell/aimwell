<h2><b>Mahādhammarakkhita </b></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>1. Mahādhammarakkhita Thera </b>
  <p>An arahant. He lived at Asokārāma. Once, Tissa, brother 
  of Asoka, saw him seated at the foot of a tree meditating, fanned by a Nāga 
  with a sāla branch. Tissa was later ordained by him. Mhv.v.161, 167; 
  ThigA.i.505; but see Sp.i.561, according to which it was Yonaka 
  Mahādhammarakhita who ordained Tissa; also SA.iii.125. </p>
  <p>After the Third Council he was sent as messenger of 
  Buddhism to Mahārattha. There he preached the Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka, and 
  eighty four thousand people were converted, thirteen thousand joining the 
  Order. Mhv.xii.5, 37; Dpv.viii.8; Sp.i.67.</li>

<ul>
  <li><b>2. Mahādhammarakkhita. </b>An ancient Commentator, 
  generally called Tipitaka Mahādhammarakkhita, who is quoted several times in 
  the Commentaries. He was a contemporary of Dīghabhānaka Abhaya. E.g., 
  DhSA.267, 278, 286f.; Vibhā.81; PSA.405.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li><b>3. Mahādhammarakkhita. </b>An Elder of Tulādhāra 
  vihāra in Rohana. Tipitaka Cūlābhaya went to him from the Mahāvihāra in order 
  to learn from him the Doctrine. At the end of the teaching, Dhammarakkhita 
  asked Abhaya to give him a subject for meditation, for, he said, Abhaya had a 
  greater knowledge than he of that matter. The subject was given, and soon 
  after Dhammarakkhita attained Nibbāna, and died while preaching at the 
  Lohapāsāda. Vsm.96f.</li>
