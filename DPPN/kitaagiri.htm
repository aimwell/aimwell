<p>A village of the Kāsis, on the road from 
Kāsi to Sāvatthi. It was the headquarters of the followers of Assaji and 
Punabbasu, who lived there, behaving in a shameless and wicked manner. A certain 
monk, on his way to Jetavana, passed through the place and was asked by a pious 
layman to complain to the Buddha of their ill-behaviour. On hearing of it, the 
Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to proclaim on them an act of banishment. 
(J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f). Some time after, when the Buddha 
visited the place with a large company of monks, including Sāriputta and 
Moggallāna, the Assajipunabbasukā, were asked to provide lodgings for the 
visitors. They agreed to do so for the Buddha, but would have nothing to do with 
Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Vin.ii.171).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.668), 
Kitāgiri was the name of a nigama (township). In the Samantapāsādikā (iii.613f) 
it is called a janapada, favoured by adequate rain and fruitful crops, and 
therefore chosen by the Assaji-Punabbasukas.</p>
