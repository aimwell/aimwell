  <h2>Kosala</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A country inhabited by the Kosalā, to 
the north-west of Magadha and next to Kāsī. It is mentioned second in the list 
of sixteen Mahājanapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.). In the Buddha’s time it 
was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son 
Vidūdabha. By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find 
that when Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, married Kosaladevī, daughter of Mahākosala 
and sister of Pasenadi, a village in Kāsī was given as part of the dowry 
(J.ii.237; iv.342f). Various Jātakas indicate that the struggle between Kāsi and 
Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 
425). Sometimes the Kāsi king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule 
over the country. At others the Kosala king would invade Kāsi and annex it to 
his own territory. Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are 
mentioned by name — e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), Dīghāvu (J.iii.211f), Vanka 
(J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of “Bāranāsiggāha,” 
(J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the 
conquest of Kāsi. Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one 
way or another are mentioned — e.g., Dīghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika 
(J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116). Sometimes the kings of the two countries 
entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407). With the capture of Kāsi 
the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and 
Magadha became inevitable. Bimbisāra’s marriage was probably a political 
alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day. Quite soon after his 
death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and 
Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. Once 
Ajātasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his 
daughter, Vajirā, in marriage and for a time all went well. Later, however, 
after his conquest of the Licchavis, Ajātasattu seems to have succeeded in 
establishing his sway in Kosala. (See Vincent Smith, op. cit., 32f). In the 
sixth century B.C. the Sākyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala. 
The Sutta Nipāta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha’s birthplace as belonging to the 
Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala. 
Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, “Bhagavā pi Kosalako, aham 
pi Kosalako.”</p>
<p>At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthi was 
the capital of Kosala. Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, 
had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348). There was also Ayojjhā, 
on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the Rāmāyana, must once have 
been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C. it was quite unimportant.
</p>
<p>The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two 
parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6). </p>
<p>Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the 
books are the Aciravatī (D.i.235) and the Sundarikā (S.i.167; SN. p.97; but see 
M.i.39, where the river is called Bāhukā). </p>

<p>The Mtu. adds Dronavastuka (iii.377) and 
Mārakaranda (i.317).</p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.400f; 
DA.i.239f) give a curious explanation of the name Kosalā. It is said that when 
nothing could make Mahāpanāda smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone 
who could succeed in doing this. People, accordingly, left their work and 
flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor 
that Mahāpanāda showed any signs of being amused. When this happened the men 
returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their 
friends, they asked of each other, “Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam.” The 
district where this occurred came to be called Kosalā on account of the 
repetition of the word kusala.</p>
<p>The Buddha spent the greater part of his 
time in Kosala, either in Sāvatthi or in touring in the various parts of the 
country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala. (See Vinaya 
Index, s.v. Kosala). It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, 
though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown. Yet, 
though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could 
meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large 
(VT.i.226). Bāvarī himself was a native of Kosala (SN.v.976), yet he preferred 
to have his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha.</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, his unnaloma 
was deposited in a thūpa in Kosala (Bu.xxviii.9). It is said that the measures 
used in Kosala were larger than those of Magadha — thus one Kosala pattha was 
equal to four Magadha patthas (SNA.ii.476).</p>
<p>Kosala is often mentioned in combination 
with Kāsi in the compound Kāsi-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kāsi-Kosala (e.g., 
A.v.59) (cf. Ariga-Magadha). See also Pasenadi.</p>
