<h4>1. Nāgapupphiya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a 
Brahmin teacher, named Suvaccha. One day he saw the Buddha travelling through 
the air and, marvelling at the miracle, sprinkled nāga flowers along his route. 
Thirty one kappas ago he was a king named Mahāratha (Ap.i.179). He is probably 
identical with Dhammasava Thera. ThagA.i.214.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nāgapupphiya Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. Probably identical with Lomasakangiya 
(ThagA.i.84). Ninety one kappas ago he saw the Buddha (Vipassi?) walking along 
the street and offered him nāga flowers. Ap.ii.450.</p>
