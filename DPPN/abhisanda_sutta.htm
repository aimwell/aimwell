<p>1. Abhisanda Sutta (3).-Unvarying 
loyalty to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, to the Sangha and possession of virtues 
dear to the Ariyan — these are the four floods of merit that bring happiness. 
S.v.391-2.</p>
<p>2. Abhisanda or Sayhaka Sutta (3).-Same 
as above; the measure of merit that accrues as a result of these four floods is 
incalculable, like the waters of the ocean (S.v.399-402).</p>
<p>In the second and third suttas of both 
these groups the fourth quality is given in (a) as possession of a heart free 
from stinginess, delighting in self-surrender; in (b) as possession of insight 
into the rise and fall of things, insight that is Ariyan.</p>
<p>3. Abhisanda Sutta.-The five yields of 
merit (puññabhisandā) which accrue to a monk because of concentration of mind in 
various activities. A.iii.51f.</p>
<p>4. Abhisanda Sutta.-The eight yields of 
merit that a monk can obtain by practising various qualities. A.iv.245f.</p>
