  <h2>Cātuma Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at the Amalakīvana in Cātumā. 
Some new members of the Order, dwelling near the Buddha, made so much noise that 
they were summoned and asked to leave at once. But the Sākiyans of Cātumā and 
Brahmā Sahampati interceded on their behalf and they were allowed to return. </p>
<p>The Buddha then preached to them that just as four terrors await the man who 
enters the water — </p>
<ul>
  <li>waves, </li>
  <li>crocodiles, </li>
  <li>whirlpools </li>
  <li>and sharks — </li>
</ul>
<p>so are there four terrors awaiting the monk — </p>
<ul>
  <li>temper, </li>
  <li>gluttony, </li>
  <li>the pleasures of the senses </li>
  <li>and women. M.i.456ff; on this see Mil.209.</li>
