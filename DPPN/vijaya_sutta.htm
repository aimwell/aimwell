<p>The eleventh sutta of the Sutta Nipāta.  </p>
<p>According to 
Buddhaghosa (SNA.i.241f), this sutta was preached on two occasions: once to 
<a href="janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm" title="j/janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm">Janapadakalyānī Nandā</a>, following her attainment of sotāpatti, in order to help 
her to higher attainment&nbsp;-&nbsp; and again when the Buddha took the monks to 
the funeral of Sirimā, sister of Jīvaka. The sutta is also called the 
<b>Kāyavicchandanika Sutta</b>.</p>
<p>The sutta is a discourse on the foul nature of the body, 
full of impurities flowing in nine streams; when dead, nobody cares for it. Only 
a monk, possessed of wisdom, understands it and reflects on its worthlessness. 
SN. vs. 193-206; cf. J.i.146.</p>
