<p>The story of <a href="ummadantii.htm" title="u/ummadantii.htm">Ummadantī</a>. 
The story was related in connection with a backsliding brother who, having seen 
a very beautiful woman as he was going his alms-rounds in Sāvatthi, gave himself 
up to despair and had to be led to the Buddha for admonition (J.v.209ff). 
</p>
<p>The story is also found, with certain 
slight variations, in the Jātakamālā under the title of Ummādayantī Jātaka (No.xiii).</p>
<p>The tale of a maiden who made all who 
saw her mad, and of the love-smitten monarch who preferred walking in the right 
path and even meeting death itself to indulging in passion, is found also in the 
Kathāsaritsāgara. E.g., in the 15th, 23rd and 91st taranga.</p>
