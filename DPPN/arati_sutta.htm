<p>1. Arati Sutta.-Once when Vangīsa was in 
Ālavī he noticed that his teacher, Nigrodha Kappa, never left his cell after his 
return from the alms-round. Disaffection arose in Vangisa’s heart and he was 
troubled by thoughts of lust. He composed several verses by way of 
self-admonition and uttered them to himself. These form the Arati Sutta. 
S.i.186-7.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Arati Sutta.-Three evil states and 
the means of removing them. A.iii.448.</p>
