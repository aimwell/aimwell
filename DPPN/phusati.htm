  <h2>Phusatī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Daughter of the Madda king and chief queen of the Sivi 
king Sañjaya and mother of Vessantara. </p>
<p>She had been Sudhammā, daughter of Kikī, and was born in 
Tāvatimsa because of an offering of sandal wood made by her to Vipassī Buddha. 
When she left Tāvatimsa, Sakka gave her ten boons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>to be chief queen, </li>
  <li>to have dark eyes, </li>
  <li>dark eyebrows, </li>
  <li>to be named Phusatī, </li>
  <li>to have a son, </li>
  <li>to keep a slim figure, </li>
  <li>to have firm breasts, </li>
  <li>hair always dark, </li>
  <li>to have soft skin, and </li>
  <li>to save the condemned. </li>
</ul>
<p>She was called Phusatī because on the day of her birth her 
body smelt of sandal wood. She was a previous birth of Mahāmāyā. J.iv.480 ff., 
593; Cyp.i.9.</p>
