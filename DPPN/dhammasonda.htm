<p>The Bodhisatta born as king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. 
He was so called because, at the time of his birth, all beings were filled with 
a desire for righteousness. The religion of Kassapa Buddha had disappeared, and 
D. was unable to get anyone to preach the Dhamma to him. He therefore left the 
kingdom and entered the forest. By his virtue Sakka’s throne was heated, and 
Sakka, coming down as a Rakkhasa, agreed to preach to D. if he would allow 
himself to be eaten. D. consented, and, climbing a rock three gāvutas high, 
threw himself into the Rakkhasa’s mouth, listening to his preaching as he fell. 
Sakka then revealed his identity, took him to the deva-world and taught him a 
stanza on impermanence, which had been spoken by Kassapa. Ras.i.2f.; the story 
is very popular in Ceylon.</p>
