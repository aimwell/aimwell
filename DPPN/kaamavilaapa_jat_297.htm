  <h2>Kāmavilāpa Jātaka (No.297)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story is similar to that of the 
Puppharatta Jātaka (q.v.). As the man stood impaled he looked up, and seeing a 
crow flying through the air, hailed him and sent a message to his wife, 
informing her where his possessions lay concealed and asking her to enjoy them 
(J.ii.443f; cp. Nos.34 and 216). In the introduction to the Jātaka it is said 
that the paccuppannavatthu is given in the Puppharatta Jātaka and the 
atītavatthu in the Indriya Jātaka. There seems to be an error here, for the 
first story of the Indriya Jātaka (J.iii.461ff) (unless another story is meant) 
bears no resemblance to the Kāmavilāpa Jātaka.</p>
