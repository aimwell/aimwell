<p>A Paribbājaka. He meets Ānanda on the 
banks of the Tapodā, where they are both bathing, and enters into conversation 
with him. Kokanuda asks Ānanda a series of questions, such as whether the world 
is eternal, whether the Tathāgata lives after death, etc., all of which, Ānanda 
says, are impossible to answer, not because he himself does not know these 
things, but because he does know them. Finally, Kokanuda asks Ānanda who he is, 
and, on learning his identity, asks his pardon for his questions which he had 
asked in all ignorance. A.v.196f.</p>
