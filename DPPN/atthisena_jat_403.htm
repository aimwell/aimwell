<p>The story of Atthisena as given above. 
Some monks in Ālavī were begging everywhere for materials and aid to build 
houses for themselves. People were annoyed by their solicitations and avoided 
them. When Mahākassapa came to Ālavī people ran away from him thinking he too 
was one of the monks. On enquiry he learnt the reason and told it to the Buddha, 
who was then at the Aggālava-cetiya. The Buddha rebuked the monks, saying that 
formerly samanas and recluses, even though offered their choice by kings, never 
asked for alms, holding that begging from others was neither agreeable nor 
pleasant. The Manikantha Jātaka (J.ii.282ff) was also preached on the same 
occasion.</p>
