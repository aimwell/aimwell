<p>A Thera. Having won the flags of three countries, he went 
on a visit to Ceylon and was honoured by the king. While passing the door of the 
Kiñjakāsanasālā, he heard a monk reciting the “<a href="n2_ny.htm#Na-tumha-Sutta" title="n/n2_ny.htm#Na-tumha-Sutta">Na tumhāka</a>” Vagga, and, touched 
thereby, he went to the Mahāvihāra and joined the Order. Having learnt the two 
Mātikā, he went with thirty others to Gavaravāliya angana, and there practised 
meditation while walking up and down. When his legs ached he walked about on his 
knees. </p>
<p>One day a hunter, mistaking him for an animal, shot at 
him. The dart pierced him, but he filled the wound with herbs, lay down on a 
slab of rock, developed insight and attained arahantship. To the monks who 
gathered round him he expressed his great joy at having succeeded in his quest, 
and they said that had the Buddha been alive he would have stroked his head 
(MA.i.190). </p>
<p>His story is given as an example of a monk striving amid 
great discomfort. E.g., AA.i.29; SA.ii.216.</p>
