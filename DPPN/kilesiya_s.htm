  <h2>Kilesiya Sutta</h2>

<p>In the Commentary to the Rathavinīta 
Sutta (MA.i.361) mention is made of a Kilesiya Sutta in which the Buddha 
preached Bhagu Thera the virtues of solitude. I have not been able to trace a 
sutta of this name. The Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.380) says that the Buddha 
visited Bhagu at Bālakalonakagāma after his attainment of arahantship to 
congratulate him on his solitude (ekavihāram anumoditum). The Samyutta 
Commentary (SA.ii.222) goes further and says that the Buddha visited him on the 
way from Kosambī to Pācīnavamsadāya, and that during this visit the Buddha 
preached to him the advantages of solitude (ekacāravāse ānisamsam) for the whole 
day after the midday meal and the whole night (sakalapacchābhattañ c'eva 
tiyāmarattiñ ca). The Vinaya passage (Vin.i.350), however, which records this 
visit does not make mention of any such special sermon, but merely says that the 
Buddha inquired after Bhagu’s health and wellbeing. v.l. Sankilesiya Sutta.</p>
