<p><b>1. Migasira Thera.</b> He belonged to a brahmin family 
of Kosala, and was so called because he was born under the constellation of 
Migasira.</p>
<p>He acquired brahmin culture and practiced the skull spell 
(chavasīsamanta), by which he could tap with his nail on the skull and declare 
the destiny of the dead person. Later, he became a Paribbājakā and visited the 
Buddha at Sāvatthi. The Buddha, having been told of his claims to knowledge, 
gave to him the skull of an arahant. Migasira tried his art, but had to confess 
himself beaten. The Buddha thereupon offered to teach him if he would join the 
Order. Migasira agreed and soon became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin, and, 
seeing the Buddha, offered him eight handfuls of kusa grass (? kusattha) 
(Thag.vss.181<span lang="en-us">f.; 
ThagA.i.305ff.).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Kusatthakadāyaka Thera of 
the Apadāna. v.l. Migasīsa. Ap.ii.416.</p>

<p><b>2. Migasira. </b>The name of a constellation and the 
month named after it. E.g., DA.i.241.</p>
