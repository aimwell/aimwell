  <h2>Kusa Jātaka (No.531)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of Kusa (q.v.). It was told in 
reference to a backsliding monk who fell in love with a woman in Sāvatthi, 
neglected all his duties and refused food. He was taken to the Buddha, who 
related this story to show how even mighty men may lose their power and come to 
misery through love of a woman. (J.v.278ff; the story is also given in 
Mtu.iii.1ff; ii.441f; the details differ, as do some of the names, from the Pāli 
version).</p>
<p>The story bears much resemblance to that 
of Anitthigandha (q.v.). See also Sammillabhāsinī.</p>
