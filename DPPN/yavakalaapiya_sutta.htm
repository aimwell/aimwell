<p>If six men, armed with flails, were to beat out a sheaf of 
corn, it would be thoroughly threshed. Thus are putthujjanas threshed by 
objects, etc.; thoughts of a future birth thresh them even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Once Vepacitti and the Asuras were defeated by Sakka and 
the Devas and Vepacitti was bound hand and foot. But when Vepacitti thought that 
the Devas were righteous, his bonds slackened. Subtle were the bonds of 
Vepacitti, but more subtle are those of Māra. He who possesses conceits of tanhā 
ditthi māna is Māra’s bondsman. S.iv.201ff.</p>
