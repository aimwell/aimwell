<p>Once, in Tambannidīpa, was a Yakkha-city called Sirīsavatthu, peopled by 
Yakkhinīs. When shipwrecked sailors were cast on the shore from the River 
Kalyānī to Nāgadīpa, the yakkhinīs would assume human form and entice them and 
use them as their husbands. On the arrival of other castaways, they would eat 
their former husbands and take the new arrivals as their lovers. Once five 
hundred merchants were cast ashore there and became the husbands of the 
yakkhinīs. In the night the yakkhinīs left them and ate their former husbands. 
The eldest merchant discovered this and warned the others, but only half of them 
were willing to attempt an escape. Now it happened that the Bodhisatta was a 
horse of the Valāhaka race and was flying through the air from the Himālaya to 
Tambapanni. There, as he passed over the banks and fields, he asked in a human 
voice: “Who wants to go home?” and the two hundred and fifty traders begged to 
be taken. They climbed on the horse’s back and tail and he took them to their 
own country. The others were eaten by the yakkhinīs.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who had become a 
backslider from running after a beautifully dressed woman. J.ii.127ff.</p>
