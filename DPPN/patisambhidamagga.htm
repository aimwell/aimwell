<p>The twelfth “book” of the 
<a href="khuddaka_n.htm" title="ku/khuddaka_n.htm">Khuddaka Nikāya</a>. It really 
belongs to the literature of the Abhidhamma type, and describes how analytical 
knowledge can be acquired by an arahant. It presents a systematic exposition of 
certain important topics of Buddhism. It is possible that, before the 
development of the extant Abhidhamma Pitaka, it passed as one of the Abhidhamma 
treatises. </p>
<p>The book consists of three Vaggas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mahā Vagga, </li>
  <li>Yuganaddha Vagga</li>
  <li>Paññā Vagga&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>and each Vagga contains ten topics (kathā). </p>
<p>The treatment of the various topics is essentially 
scholastic in character, and whole passages are taken verbatim from the Vinaya 
and from various collections of the Sutta Pitaka, while a general acquaintance 
with the early Buddhist legends is assumed. (Published by the P.T.S. There is an 
index in J.R.A.S., 1908).</p>
<p>A commentary exists, written by Mahānāma, a Thera of 
Ceylon, and called Saddhammappakāsinī.</p>
