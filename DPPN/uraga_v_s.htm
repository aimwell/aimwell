<p><b>1. Uraga Vagga.</b>-The first chapter of the 
Sutta Nipāta. It consists of twelve suttas. Sn.1ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Uraga Vagga.</b>-The first section of the 
Peta-Vatthu. The last story in the section is called Uraga Peta-Vatthu. Pv., 
p.11.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Uraga Sutta.</b>-The first sutta of the 
Sutta Nipāta. It was preached at the Aggālava Cetiya in Ālavī. The Ālavaka monks 
cut down trees to build new houses for themselves, and one of them in felling a 
tree which was the abode of a tree-sprite hurt her child’s hand. Though sorely 
tempted to kill the monk on the spot, the sprite checked herself and made 
complaint to the Buddha, who asked her to occupy another tree (SnA.i.3f; the 
story is also given in Vin.iv.34 and in DhA.iii.229f). The first stanza of the 
sutta was preached to the devatā. The Sutta-Nipāta Commentary (SnA.i.15ff) gives 
the occasions on which the other stanzas were preached. Buddhaghosa says 
(Sp.iv.761) that the devatā mentioned above took up her residence in Jetavana, 
on a spot indicated to her by the Buddha, and had, therefore, the privilege of 
listening to the Buddha’s sermons at close quarters, even when there were great 
assemblies of the devas present and less powerful devas, like herself, had 
generally to yield place to the more powerful. She could not be dislodged from 
the place appointed to her by the Buddha.</p>
