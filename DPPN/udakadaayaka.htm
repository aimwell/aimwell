<p>1. Udakadāyaka Thera.-An arahant. In a 
former birth he saw the Buddha Siddattha having his meal and brought him a pot 
of water. Sixty-one kappas ago he became a king named Vimala (Ap.i.205). He is 
probably identical with Sānu Thera. ThagA.i.115.</p>
<p>2. Udayadāyaka Thera.-An arahant. In a 
previous birth he filled a vessel of water for Padumuttara Buddha. As a result, 
he could find water in any spot he wished (Ap.ii.437). His Apadāna-verses are 
found in the Theragāthā Commentary under the names of two theras: Mahā Gavaccha 
(i.57) and Gangātīriya (i.249).</p>
