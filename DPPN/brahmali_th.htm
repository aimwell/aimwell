<h2>Brahmāli Thera</h2>
<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Kosala, and, through 
association with spiritually minded friends and his own realization of the ills 
of samsāra, he entered the Order. Dwelling in the forest he soon developed 
insight and acquired arahantship. </p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder, and, 
seeing the Buddha going on his alms rounds, he gave him a vāra-fruit.
