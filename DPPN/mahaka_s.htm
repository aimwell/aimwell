<p>Once a number of monks staying in the Ambātakagrove in 
Macchikāsanda were entertained by Citta-gahapati to a 
sumptuous meal. At the end of the meal, Citta, escorted them back to the 
monastery. On the way the monks were overcome by the heat, and Mahaka, the 
junior monk, with the permission of his senior, made by his magic power a cool 
wind to blow and wrought a thunderstorm accompanied by gentle rain. Citta was 
greatly impressed, and, seeking Mahaka in his cell, asked him to perform some 
miracle. Mahaka told him to put his cloak on the veranda and to scatter a bundle 
of grass on it. Then he retired to his cell, locked the door, and caused a flame 
to dart through the keyhole and burn the grass without damaging the cloak. Citta 
was overcome with surprise, and promised to supply Mahaka with all requisites. 
Mahaka thanked him, but soon after left Macchikāsanda never to return. Because 
he did not wish to enjoy gains won by a display of iddhi power; S.vi.288ff.; the 
story is also referred to at Vsm. 393.</p>
