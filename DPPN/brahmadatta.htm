<p><b>1. Brahmadatta.</b> King of Kāsi. He captured Kosala 
and murdered its king Dīghiti and Dīghiti’s wife, but made peace later with 
Dīghiti’s son, Dīghāvu, restored to him his father’s kingdom, and gave him his 
own daughter in marriage. Vin.i.342ff.; DhA.i.56f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Brahmadatta. </b>King of the Assakas and friend of 
Renu. When Mahāgovinda divided Jambudīpa into seven equal portions for Renu and 
his six friends, Brahmadatta was given the kingdom, of the Assakas, with Potama 
as his capital. D.ii.235f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Brahmadatta</b><span lang="en-us"><b>.</b>
In the Jātaka Commentary this is given as the name of 
numerous kings of Benares. In most cases we are told nothing further of them 
than that they reigned at Benares at the time of the incidents related in the 
story. Brahmadatta, was probably the dynastic name of the kings of Benares. 
Thus, for instance, in the Gangamāla Jātaka (J.iii.452) Udaya, king of Benares, 
is addressed as Brahmadatta. </p>
<p>In the Gandatindu Jātaka (J.v.102-106) however, Pañcāla, 
king of Uttarapañcāla, is also called Brahmadatta; in this case it was evidently 
his personal name. It was also the name of the husband of Pingiyāni (q.v.). He 
was a king, but we are not told of what country. He is identified (J.v.444) with 
Kunāla.</p>

<p><b>4. Brahmadatta Thera</b><span lang="en-us"><b>.</b>
He was the son of the king of Kosala, and, having 
witnessed the Buddha’s majesty at the consecration of Jetavana, he entered the 
Order and in due course became an arahant. One day, while going for alms, he was 
abused by a brahmin, but kept silence. Again and again the brahmin abused him, 
and the people marvelled at the patience of Brahmadatta, who then preached to 
them on the wisdom of not returning abuse for abuse. The brahmin was much moved 
and entered the Order under Brahmadatta. Thag. vs. 441 6; ThagA.i.460ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Brahmadatta.</b> Head of a dynasty of thirty six 
kings, all of whom ruled at Hatthipura. His ancestors ruled at Kapilanagara. MT. 
127; Dpv.iii.18.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Brahmadatta</b><span lang="en-us"><b>.</b>
A Pacceka Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he had 
been a monk and had lived in the forest for twenty thousand years. He was then 
born as the son of the king of Benares. When his father died he became king, 
ruling over twenty thousand cities with Benares as the capital, but, wishing for 
quiet, he retired into solitude in the palace. </p>
<p>His wife tired of him and committed adultery with a 
minister who was banished on the discovery of his offence. He then took service 
under another king and persuaded him to attack Brahmadatta. Brahmadatta’s 
minister, much against his will, and having promised not to take life, made a 
sudden attack on the enemy and drove them away. Brahmadatta, seated on the field 
of battle, developed thoughts of metā and became a Pacceka Buddha. SNA.i.58ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Brahmadatta.</b> A brahmin, father of Kassapa 
Buddha. J.i.43; Bu.xxv.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Brahmadatta.</b> Pupil of the Paribbājaka Suppiya. A 
conversation between these two led to the preaching of the Brahmajāla Sutta. 
D.i.1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Brahmadatta.</b> A monk, sometimes credited with 
having supplied the illustrations to the aphorisms in Kaccāyama’s grammar. P.L.C. 
180.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Brahmadatta.</b> See also Ekaputtika-, Catumāsika-, 
Cūlani-, and Sāgara-; and below, s.v. Brahmadatta-kumāra.</p>
