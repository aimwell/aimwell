<p>A mango-grove in Rājagaha, belonging to 
Jīvaka, which he made over to the Buddha and his monks. He built a monastery in 
the grove, and there the Buddha stayed several times. On one such occasion 
Ajātasattu visited the Buddha and the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached 
(D.i.47ff). The Jīvaka Suttas, mentioned above, were also preached there. The 
mango-grove was near Maddakucchi, so thither they carried the Buddha when his 
foot was injured by a splinter from the rock hurled by Devadatta (DhA.ii.164, 
etc.). </p>
<p>It was in this grove that Cūlapanthaka 
attained arahantship, and, at that time, there were five hundred monks there 
(J.i.114f., etc.). </p>
<p>Nuns, too, appear to have gone there for 
their siesta. ThigA.245f.</p>
