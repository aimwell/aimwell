  <h2>Sevitabba-asevitabba Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The one hundred and fourteenth sutta of the Majjhima 
Nikāya, preached to the monks at Jetavana regarding the twofold behaviour in 
act, speech, and thought that which should be followed and that which should 
not. Sāriputta, who is present, asks the Buddha at the end of the discourse 
several questions, in order that certain statements made by the Buddha should be 
clearer to his hearers. M.iii.45f.</p>
