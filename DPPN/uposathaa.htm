<p>A pious lay-devotee of Sāketa. She did 
many deeds of merit, and was born in Tāvatimsa, her abode being known as the 
Uposatha-vimāna. It is said that she was known in Sāketa as Uposatha, because of 
the life she led. She expresses to Moggallāna her remorse that she should have 
desired to be born in Nandana-vana, instead of listening to the Buddha’s 
teaching and putting an end to all birth. Vv.20f; VvA.115f.</p>
