  <h2>Tathāgatena-vutta Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Another record (see Vin.i.10ff) of the 
first sermon preached by the Buddha, more commonly known as the 
Dhammaccakkappavattana Sutta (q.v.). </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the sutta, news of 
the establishment of the kingdom of the Dhamma was proclaimed throughout the 
Cakkavāla. </p>
<p>Kondañña alone, of the Pañcavaggiyas, 
understood the significance of the teaching, and became known as Aññata-Kondañña 
(S.v.420ff; Vin.i.10ff). This sutta is followed by a repetition of itself, but 
with the words “Tathāgatas” (plural) substituted for “Tathāgata.” (S.v.424f).</p>
