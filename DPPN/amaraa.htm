  <h2>Amarā (Amarādevī)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Wife of Mahosadha. She was the daughter 
of a merchant who had fallen on evil days. Mahosadha, while seeking for a wife, 
met her as she was taking a meal to her father and entered into conversation 
with her. He asked her various questions and she answered in riddles. Mahosadha 
went to her father’s house and plied his trade as a tailor, taking the 
opportunity of observing the girl’s behaviour. He tested her temper and her 
character in various ways, and being satisfied that she was altogether 
desirable, he married her with the approval of Queen Udumbarā. She became 
popular with everybody and was of great assistance to her husband in frustrating 
the attempts of his enemies to work him harm (J.vi.364-72, 392; the story 
appears also in Mtu.ii.83).</p>
<p>In the present age Amarā was the 
beautiful Bimbādevī (J.vi.478).</p>
<p>In the Milinda (pp.205ff ) the king 
mentions the story of Amarādevī having been left behind in the village while her 
husband was away on a journey, and of her resisting a temptation to be 
unfaithful to him. “If that be true, how,” asks the king, “could you justify the 
Buddha’s statement (*) that all women will go wrong, failing others, even with a 
cripple?” Nāgasena explains this by saying that Amarā did not sin because she 
had neither real secrecy nor opportunity nor the right-wooer!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*) Incidentally, these words do not 
  really belong to the Buddha. They appear in the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.435), which 
  is a specimen of Indian folklore and not of Buddhist belief.</p>
