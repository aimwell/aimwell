<p>One of three brothers, the 
<b>Tebhātika-Jatilas</b>, living at <a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a>. He lived on the banks of the 
<a href="neranjara.htm" title="n/neranjara.htm">Nerañjarā</a> 
with five hundred disciples. Further down the river lived his brothers <b>Nadī-Kassapa</b> 
with three hundred disciples and <b>Gayā-Kassapa</b> with two hundred.  </p>
<p>The Buddha 
visited Uruvela-Kassapa and took lodging for the night where the sacred fire was 
kept, in spite of Kassapa’s warning that the spot was inhabited by a fierce 
<a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāga</a>. The Buddha, by his magical powers, overcame, first this Nāga and then 
another, both of whom vomited fire and smoke. Kassapa being pleased with this 
exhibition of iddhi-power, undertook to provide the Buddha with his daily food. 
Meanwhile the Buddha stayed in a grove near by, waiting for the time when 
Kassapa should be ready for conversion. Here he was visited by the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Four Regent 
Gods</a>, <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, Brahma and others. The Buddha spent the whole rainy season there, 
performing, in all, three thousand five hundred miracles of various kinds, 
reading the thoughts of Kassapa, splitting firewood for the ascetics' 
sacrifices, heating stoves for them to use after bathing in the cold weather, 
etc. Still Kassapa persisted in the thought, “The great ascetic is of great 
magic power, but he is not an arahant like me.” Finally the Buddha decided to 
startle him by declaring that he was not an arahant, neither did the way he 
followed lead to arahantship. Thereupon Kassapa owned defeat and reverently 
asked for ordination. The Buddha asked him to consult with his pupils, and they 
cut off their hair and threw it with their sacrificial utensils into the river 
and were all ordained. Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa came to inquire what had 
happened, and they, too, were ordained with their pupils. At 
<a href="gayaasiisa.htm" title="g/gayaasiisa.htm">Gayāsīsa</a> the Buddha 
preached to them the Fire Sermon (<a href="aadittapariyaaya_s.htm" title="aa/aadittapariyaaya_s.htm">Āditta-pariyāya</a>), and they all attained 
arahantship.</p>
<p>From Gayāsīsa the Buddha went to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> with the Kassapas and their pupils, and in the presence of 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> 
and the assembled populace Uruvela-Kassapa declared his allegiance to the 
Buddha. This story of the conversion of the Kassapas is given in Vin.i.24ff and 
in AA.i.165f; also in ThagA.i.434ff.</p>
<p>Later, in the assembly of monks, 
Uruvela-Kassapa was declared to be the chief of those who had large followings (aggam 
mahāparisānam) (A.i.25). Six verses attributed to him are found in the 
Theragāthā (vv.375-80), wherein he reviews his achievement and relates how he 
was won over by the Buddha.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a householder, and having seen the Buddha declare a monk (Sīhaghosa was his 
name, Ap.ii.481) to be the best of them with large followings, wished for 
himself to be so honoured in a future life, and did many works of merit towards 
that end.</p>
<p>Later, he was born in the family of 
Phussa Buddha as his younger step-brother, his father being Mahinda. (According 
to Bu.xix.14, Phussa’s father was Jayasena). He had two other brothers. The 
three quelled a frontier disturbance and, as a reward, obtained the right to 
entertain the Buddha for three months. They appointed three of their ministers 
to make all the arrangements and they themselves observed the ten precepts. The 
three ministers so appointed were, in this age, Bimbisāra, Visākha and 
Ratthapāla.</p>
<p>Having sojourned among gods and men, the 
three brothers, in their last birth, were born in a brahmin family, the name of 
which was Kassapa. They learnt the three Vedas and left the household life 
(AA.i.165f; DhA.i.83ff; Ap.ii.481ff).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm" title="maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544.htm">Mahā-Nārada-Kassapa 
Jātaka</a> (J.vi.220ff; Ap.ii.483), Uruvela-Kassapa was once born as Angati, king of 
Mithilā in the Videha country. He listened to the teachings of a false teacher 
called Guna and gave himself up to pleasure, till he was saved by his wise 
daughter Rujā, with the help of the Brahma Nārada, who was the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>Uruvela-Kassapa was so called partly to 
distinguish him from other Kassapas and partly because he was ordained at 
Uruvela. At first he had one thousand followers, and after he was ordained by 
the Buddha all his followers stayed with him and each of them ordained a great 
number of others, so that their company became very numerous (AA.i.166).</p>
<p>The scene of the conversion of 
Uruvela-Kassapa is sculptured in Sanchi. According to Tibetan sources, Kassapa 
was one hundred and twenty years old at the time of his conversion (Rockhill, 
op. cit., 40).  </p>
<p><a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a> found a stūpa erected on the spot where the Buddha 
converted Kassapa (Beal, Bud. Records, ii.130).</p>
<p><a href="belatthasisa_th.htm" title="b/belatthasisa_th.htm">Belatthasīsa</a> was a disciple of 
Uruvela-Kassapa and joined his teacher when the latter was converted 
(ThagA.i.67). <a href="senaka.htm" title="s/senaka.htm">Senaka Thera</a> was Kassapa’s sister’s son (ThagA.i.388).
<a href="vacchapaala_th.htm" title="va/vacchapaala_th.htm">Vacchapāla</a> 
was among those who joined the Order, after having seen Kassapa pay homage to 
the Buddha at Rājagaha (ThagA.i.159).</p>
