  <h2>Kukku Jātaka (No.396)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Contains several parables which the 
Bodhisatta, as counsellor to Brahmadatta, king of Benares, employed for the 
king’s instruction. Like the peak of a roof which falls unless tightly held by 
the rafters, is a king who must be supported by his subjects who have been won 
over by his righteousness. As a citron must be eaten without its peel, so must 
taxes be gathered without violence. Like the lotus, unstained by the water in 
which it grows, is the virtuous man untainted by the world.</p>
<p>The king is identified with Ānanda 
(J.iii.317ff). The occasion for the story is given in the Tesakuna Jātaka.</p>
