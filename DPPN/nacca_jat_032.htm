<p>When the world was yet young, a golden swan, who had been 
elected king of the birds, had a lovely daughter, and to her he promised the 
boon of being allowed to choose her own husband. When all the birds were 
assembled, she gazed on them, and, by reason of his beautiful colouring, chose 
the peacock. Overjoyed by his good fortune, the peacock spread his feathers and 
began to dance, thus exposing himself, and feeling no shame. The swanking was so 
shocked by this lack of modesty that he gave his daughter to a young swan.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who was 
charged before the Buddha with possessing too many clothes. On being questioned 
by the Buddha, he removed all his clothes and stood naked in the assembly. The 
people expressed disgust at his behaviour, and he 
became a layman. He is identified with the peacock of the story.</p>
<p>J.i.206ff. The story is sculptured in Bharhut; see Stupa 
of Bharhut. Pl.zzvii. (11).</p>
