<h2>Mahāsāla Sutta</h2>
<p><b>1. Mahāsāla Sutta.</b> A rich brahmin asks the Buddha 
why there is an apparent decrease of human beings. The Buddha answers that it is 
because the world is ablaze with unlawful lusts, wrong doctrines, and depraved 
longings. There is no reasonable rain, harvests are 
poor, and men die easily. A.i.159f.</p>
<p><b>2. Mahāsāla or Lūkhapāpurana Sutta.</b> A wealthy 
brahmin, looking worn and wearing a coarse garment, visits the Buddha at 
Sāvatthi and tells him that his four sons, aided by their wives, have shown him 
the door. The Buddha teaches him several verses illustrating the ingratitude of 
his sons to be recited in the Santhāgārasālā. He recited these and his sons, who 
are in the assembly, take him home and look after him. Later he goes to the 
Buddha and asks him to accept a set of garments which his sons have given him. 
The Buddha accepts it out of compassion (S.i.175f).</p>
<p>The Commentary says that the man had immense wealth in his 
house, some eighty crores. He found wives for his sons and divided half his 
wealth among them. His wife died, and his sons, fearful lest he should marry 
again and they should lose the rest of their patrimony, pet him and look after 
him, and he gives them all except his wrap. He goes to live with his eldest son, 
but is driven out by his daughter in law; the rest of the family treats him 
likewise. He enters the order of the Pandarangas and suffers the greatest 
privations, till he finally throws himself on the reputed kindness and 
graciousness of the Buddha. When the people discover the disloyalty of the sons 
they threaten to kill them, and then the sons take the old man back and nurse 
him. Later the members of the family become sotāpannas. SA.i.202ff.</p>
