<p>An arahant. He was a nobleman of Vesāli and left the world after hearing the 
Buddha preach the Ratana Sutta. After ordination, he dwelt in a pleasant hut in 
a beautiful forest, where he won arahantship. One day some women tried to tempt 
him, but in vain (Thag.58; ThagA.i.122f.).</p>
<p>His first desire to attain liberation was made in the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha. Later he gave a beautiful seat to Atthadassī Buddha and offered him 
flowers in homage. One hundred and seventy kappas ago he was a king named 
Sandimā (Sannibbāpaka). He is probably identical with Asanūpatthāyaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.144.</p>
