<h4>1. Padumuttara</h4>
<p>The tenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in 
Hamsavatī, of the khattiya Ānanda and his wife Sujātā. At the moments of his 
birth and his Enlightenment, a shower of lotuses fell in the ten thousand 
worlds, hence his name. He lived as a householder for ten thousand years in 
three palaces: Naravāhana, Yassa (or Yasavatī) and Vasavatti. His wife was 
Vasudattā, by whom he had a son, Uttara (according to SNA.i.341, his son was 
Uparevata). He left home in his palace (Vasavatti), and practised austerities 
only for seven days. A maiden of Ujjeni, called Rucinandā, gave him milk rice, 
and the Ājīvaka Sumitta gave him grass for his seat. His bodhi tree was a salala, 
under which he spent a week, and when he touched the ground with his foot, huge 
lotus flowers sprang out of the earth, covering his body completely with their 
pollen. (The Samyuttabhānakas give this as the reason for his name.) His first 
sermon was preached to his cousins Devala and Sujāta, who later became his chief 
disciples. The spot where the sermon was preached was Mithiluyyāna. Sumana was 
Padumuttara’s personal attendant, Amitā and Asamā his chief women disciples, 
Vitinna and Tissa his chief patrons among men, and Hatthā and Vicittā among 
women. His body was fifty eight cubits high, and his aura spread for twelve 
yojanas. He died in Nandārāma at the age of one hundred thousand, and a thūpa 
twelve leagues in height was erected over his relics. In his time, the 
Bodhisatta was governor of a province (ratthika) called Jatika (Jatila). 
Bu.xi.1ff.; BuA.157ff.; J.i.37, 44; DhA.i.99, 417; iii.146, etc.; also Ap.i.57, 
63, 101, 107; Mtu.ii.58.</p>
<p>It is said (E.g., MT.59) that in the time of Padumuttara 
there did not exist a single heretic.</p>
<p>Many of the eminent disciples of Gotama Buddha are said to 
have first conceived their desire for their respective positions in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha, after seeing similar rank conferred on Padumuttara’s various 
disciples in acknowledgment of their special attainments —
