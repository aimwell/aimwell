<p>A brahmin, probably of Pātaliputta. On 
coming to visit <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, he saw Udena there in Khemiyambavana and had a 
conversation with him, recorded in the Ghotamukha Sutta. At the conclusion of 
the talk he declared himself converted and wished to offer to Udena the daily 
allowance of five hundred kahāpanas which he regularly received from the king of 
Anga. Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall 
for the Order at Pātaliputta. The suggestion was agreed to and the 
assembly-hall, when built, was called Ghotamukhī (M.ii.157ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary (MA.ii.786f) 
adds that Ghotamukha held the view that one should seek self-glorification, even 
by the slaughter of one’s parents, and that he was the only person born in 
heaven, in spite of having held that view. After his birth in heaven, having 
discovered the cause of his good fortune, be came to earth in disguise and, 
after revealing his identity to his only remaining sister, told her where his 
treasures were hidden and instructed her to spend some of the money on 
renovating an old refectory which the monks were trying to restore.</p>
