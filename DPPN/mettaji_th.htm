  <h2>Mettaji Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Magadha, and, when he 
grew up, became a forest dwelling monk. Hearing of the Buddha’s advent, Mettaji 
visited him, and questioned him concerning progress and regress (pavattiyo), 
and, believing, he entered the Order and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Anomadassī Buddha he was a householder and 
built a wall round the Bodhi tree. One hundred kappas ago he was a king named 
Sabbagghana (Sabbosana) (Thag.94; ThagA.i.194f). He is evidently identical with 
Anulomadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.173.</p>
