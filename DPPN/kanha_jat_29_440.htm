<p>1. Kanha Jātaka (No.29).-The story of 
Ayya-kālaka (q.v.). The story was related by the Buddha to the monks, who 
expressed great wonder at the miracles performed by him at Sankassa. It was not 
only in his last birth that he performed wonders.</p>
<p>The old woman in the story is identified 
with Uppalavanā (J.i.193ff).</p>
<p>The story is also given in the Anguttara 
Commentary (i.415), with a few additional details. The Dhammapada Commentary 
(iii.213) refers to it as the Kanhausabha Jātaka.</p>
<p>2. Kanha Jātaka (No.440).-The story of 
Kanha-tāpasa. He was the only son of a brahmin in Benares and inherited great 
wealth; he was educated at Takkasilā. When his parents died he gave away all his 
wealth and retired to the Himalaya, where he practised rigid asceticism, never 
entering a village, eating the produce of only one tree, and living not even in 
a hut. He acquired great mystic powers, and Sakka’s throne was heated by his 
virtue. Sakka visited him and, having tested him and asked him various 
questions, granted him six boons. The ascetic chose only such things as 
pertained to the life of renunciation. Sakka decreed that the tree under which 
the ascetic lived should bear fruit perennially.</p>
<p>The Sakka of the story was Anuruddha. It 
is said that the acetic was called Kanha on account of his dark complexion.</p>
<p>The story was related to Ānanda in 
explanation of the Buddha’s smile as he was passing a certain spot in the 
Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu; it was the spot where the ascetic Kanha practised 
his meditations. J.iv.6ff</p>
