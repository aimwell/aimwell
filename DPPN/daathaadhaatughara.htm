<p>A building in Anurādhapura, in which was 
deposited the Tooth Relic after its arrival in Ceylon, in the reign of 
Sirimeghavanna. The building was evidently attached to the palace “in royal 
territory,” and was originally erected by Devānampiyatissa, its name then being 
Dhammacakka (Cv.xxxvii.95f). Dhātusena restored it (Cv.xxxviii.70), while 
Aggabodhi I. beautified it with various decorations (Cv.xlii.33). It was burnt 
by the Colas, but was rebuilt by Mahinda IV. We are told that it was situated 
nagaramajjhamhi, i.e., in the heart of the royal quarters (Cv.xliv.134; liv.45).</p>
