</ul>
<p>An eminent Therī. She was born at <a href="devadaha.htm" title="d/devadaha.htm">Devadaha</a> in the family 
of <a href="suppabuddha.htm" title="s/suppabuddha.htm">Suppabuddha</a> as the younger sister of 
<a href="mahamaayaa.htm" title="maha/mahamaayaa.htm">Mahāmāyā</a>. </p>
<p>Ap.ii.538 says her father was Añjana Sakka and her mother 
Sulakkhanā. Mhv.ii.18 says her father was Añjana and her mother 
<a href="yasodharaa.htm" title="y/yasodharaa.htm">Yasodharā</a>. 
<a href="dandapaanii.htm" title="d/dandapaanii.htm">Dandapāni</a> and Suppabuddha were her brothers; cp. Dpv.xviii.7f.</p>
<p>At the birth of each sister, interpreters of bodily marks 
prophesied that their children would be cakkavattins. King 
<a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a> married 
both the sisters, and when Mahāmāyā died, seven days after the birth of the 
Buddha, Pajāpati looked after the Buddha and nursed him. She was the mother of 
Nanda, but it is said that she gave her own son to nurses and herself nursed the 
Buddha. The Buddha was at <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> when Suddhodana died, and Pajāpatī decided to 
renounce the world, and waited for an opportunity to ask the permission of the 
Buddha. </p>
<p>Pajāpatī was already a sotāpanna. She attained this 
eminence when the Buddha first visited his father’s palace and preached the 
<a href="mahadhammapala_jat_447.htm" title="maha/mahadhammapala_jat_447.htm">Mahādhammapāla Jātaka</a> (DhA.i.97).</p>
<p>Her opportunity came when the Buddha visited <a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> 
to settle the dispute between the <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyans</a> and the 
<a href="koliyaa.htm" title="ku/koliyaa.htm">Koliyans</a> as to the right to 
take water from the river <a href="rohini.htm" title="r/rohini.htm">Rohinī</a>. When the dispute had been settled, the Buddha 
preached the <a href="kalahavivaada_s.htm" title="ka/kalahavivaada_s.htm">Kalahavivāda Sutta</a>, and five hundred young 
Sākiyan men joined the 
Order. Their wives, led by Pajāpatī, went to the Buddha and asked leave to be 
ordained as nuns. This leave the Buddha refused, and he went on to 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>. But 
Pajāpatī and her companions, nothing daunted, had barbers to cut off their hair, 
and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot. They arrived 
with wounded feet at the Buddha’s monastery and repeated their request. The 
Buddha again refused, but Ānanda interceded on their behalf and their request 
was granted, subject to eight strict conditions. </p>
<p>For details see Vin.ii.253ff.; also A.iv.274ff. There was 
some question, which arose later as to the procedure of Pajāpatī’s ordination, 
which was not formal. When the nuns discovered this some of them refused to hold 
the uposatha with her. But the Buddha declared that he himself had ordained her 
and that all was in order (DhA.iv.149). Her upasampadā consisted in acquiescing 
in the eight conditions laid down for nuns (Sp.i.242).</p>
<p>After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and 
worshipped him. The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for 
meditation. With this topic she developed insight and soon after won 
arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after 
listening to the <a href="nandakovada_s.htm" title="n/nandakovada_s.htm">Nandakovāda Sutta</a>. Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in 
<a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who had experience (rattaññūnam) 
(A.i.25). Not long after, while at Vesāli, she realized that her life had come 
to an end. She was one hundred and twenty years old; she took leave of the 
Buddha, performed various miracles, and then died, her five hundred companions 
dying with her. It is said that the marvels which attended her cremation rites 
were second only to those of the Buddha.</p>
<p>It was in the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha that Pajāpatī 
made her resolve to gain eminence. She then belonged to a clansman’s family in Hamsavatī, and, hearing the Buddha assign the foremost place in experience to a 
certain nun, wished for similar recognition herself, doing many good deeds to 
that end. After many births she was born once more at Benares, forewoman among 
five hundred slave girls. When the rains drew near, five Pacceka Buddhas came 
from Nandamūlaka to Isipatana seeking lodgings. Pajāpatī saw them after the 
Treasurer had refused them any assistance, and, after consultation with her 
fellow slaves, they persuaded their several husbands to erect five huts for the 
Pacceka Buddhas during the rainy season and they provided them with all 
requisites. At the end of the rains they gave three robes to each Pacceka 
Buddha. After that she was born in a weaver’s village near Benares, and again 
ministered, this time to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of 
<a href="padumavati.htm" title="pa/padumavati.htm">Padumavatī</a> 
(ThigA.140ff.; AA.i.185f.; Ap.ii.529 43).</p>
<p>It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha 
of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate. But when it came to be offered 
to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a 
whole. Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> intervened. But the Buddha 
explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as 
an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future. This was 
the occasion for the preaching of the <a href="dakkhinaavibhanga_s.htm" title="d/dakkhinaavibhanga_s.htm">Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta</a> (M.iii.253ff.; 
MA.ii.1001ff.; this incident is referred to in the Milinda p.240). The Buddha 
had a great love for Pajāpatī, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to 
visit her and preach to her — that being against 
the rule — the Buddha amended the rule and went 
himself to preach to her (Vin.iv.56).</p>
<p>Pajāpatī’s name appears several times in the Jātakas. She 
was the mother monkey in the <a href="culla_nandiya_jat_222.htm" title="c/culla_nandiya_jat_222.htm">Cūla Nandiya Jātaka</a> (J.ii.202), Candā in the 
<a href="culla_dhammapaala_jat_358.htm" title="c/culla_dhammapaala_jat_358.htm">Culla 
Dhammapāla</a> (J.iii.182), and Bhikkhudāyikā (or Bhikkhudāsikā) daughter of 
<a href="kikii.htm" title="ku/kikii.htm">Kiki</a>, 
king of Benares (J.vi.481).</p>
<p>Mahāpajāpatī was so called because, at her birth, augerers 
prophesied that she would have a large following; Gotamī was her gotta name 
(MA.i.1001; cp. AA.ii.774).</p>
<p>There is a story related of a nurse employed by Pajāpatī 
and born in Devadaha. She renounced the world with Pajāpatī, but for twenty five 
years was harassed by thoughts of lust till, at last, she heard 
<a href="dhammadinnaa.htm" title="d/dhammadinnaa.htm">Dhammadinnā</a> 
preach.<span lang="en-us"> She then practiced 
meditation and became an arahant. ThigA.75f.</p>
