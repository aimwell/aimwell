<p>In the royal palace at Rājagaha, the report once arose 
among the retinue that Sākyan recluses were allowed to take gold and silver. The 
headman Manicūlaka, who was present, denied this, but, being unable to convince 
his audience, he sought the Buddha, who assured him that these monks were 
allowed neither to seek nor to accept gold and silver. S.iv.325f.; cp. 
Vin.ii.296f.</p>
