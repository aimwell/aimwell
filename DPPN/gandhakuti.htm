  <h2>Gandhakuti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the special apartment 
occupied by the Buddha at the <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> monastery (J.i.92). The building, of 
which the Gandhakuti formed a part, was evidently called the Gandhakuti-parivena, 
and there the Buddha would assemble the monks and address them (E.g., J.i.501; 
iii.67). The site, on which stands the bed of the Buddha in the Gandhakuti, is 
the same for every Buddha, and is one of the unalterable sites – 
avijahitatthÄnÄni (BuA.247).</p>
<p>The name Gandhakuti seems to have been 
used later in reference also to other residences of the Buddha. Thus, we are 
told (AA.i.226; see C.S.B., Pl.5B) that <a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">VisÄkhÄ</a> built a Gandhakuti for the 
Buddha in the <a href="pubbarama.htm" title="pu/pubbarama.htm">PubbÄrÄma</a> with the money she obtained by the sale of her 
<a href="mahalata_pasadhana.htm" title="maha/mahalata_pasadhana.htm">MahÄlatÄpasÄdhana</a>. For further details see
