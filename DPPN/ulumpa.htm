<p>A township of the Sākyans. The Buddha 
once stayed there and was visited by Pasenadi, king of Kosala, who felt remorse 
for the murder of his general Bandhula. The king went alone inside the 
Gandhakuti, laying aside the symbols of royalty which he left with his minister 
Dīgha-Kārāyana. When the king came out, he found that all his followers had 
gone, leaving behind only one horse and a serving-woman. On learning that 
Vidūdabha had been made king, Pasenadi left for Rājagaha, to seek the help of 
Ajātasattu, and died outside the city-gates. J.iv.151f; DhA.i.356. See also 
Medatalumpa.</p>
