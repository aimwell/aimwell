</ul>
<p>A king of Benares, so called because he never tired of 
learning (suta). He was once visited by eight Pacceka Buddhas and entertained 
them. At the end of the meal, they rose and, each speaking only a word or two as 
thanks went away. The king was at first disappointed, but realizing the import 
of their words, he renounced the world and became a Pacceka Buddha. </p>
<p>His verse is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta (verse 
57). SNA.i.109f.; ApA.i.157.</p>
