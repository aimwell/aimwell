<p>The wife of Prince Sāli. She was a 
candāla woman of exceedingly great beauty, and the prince married her, thus 
renouncing his right to the throne (Mhv.xxiii.2-4). The two had been husband and 
wife, named Tissa and Nagā, in a previous existence and had lived in Mundagangā 
in Ceylon. One day the husband received a pig from a hunter in payment of some 
smith’s work he had done. Having prepared the animal for food, he expressed the 
wish that eight holy monks might come to accept alms from him. His wife joining 
him in this wish, they decorated the house, prepared eight seats, strewed the 
village path with sand and awaited the guests. Dhammadinna Thera of Piyangudīpa, 
having divined the man’s wish, came to the village with seven colleagues. After 
they had eaten, they gave thanks and went away. The man was born as Sāli the son 
of Dutthagāmani, but his wife was born as a candāla as punishment for an offence 
in another existence. She had been the youngest of seven daughters of a 
carpenter and was one day scolded by her mother for untidiness. In anger she 
used to her mother the same abusive terms as had been hurled at her. This 
undutiful behaviour caused her to be born as the daughter of a candāla. MT.606

<p>Her name was Devī, and her father was 
the chief candāla in Hallolagāma. Her story is given at great length in 
Ras.ii.117f.</p>
