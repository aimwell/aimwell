<p>A quadrangular hall, forming a part of 
the Mahāvihāra and serving as a refectory for the monks. It was erected on one 
of the spots where the earth trembled when sprinkled with flowers by Mahinda. 
Mahinda declared that in the time of the three previous Buddhas gifts, brought 
from all parts of the Island, were collected there and offered to the Buddhas 
and their followers (Mhv.xv.47ff). It is not known who built the hall, but it 
was restored by Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.88). The Mahāvamsa-Tīkā says (p.307) that 
earth from under the lintel of the Catussālā was used to make the vessels in 
which were placed the utensils employed in the coronation ceremony of the kings 
of Ceylon.</p>
