  <h2>Kumārapañha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth chapter of the Khuddaka-Pātha 
(Khp.2). </p>
<p>It consists of ten questions which, according to the Commentaries 
(KhpA.76; ThagA.i.479), the Buddha asked the young Sopāka, then an arahant 
though only seven years old, with the idea of giving him the upasampadā-ordination. </p>
<p>The boy-arahant answered the questions 
and this conversation formed his ordination. (See also Thag.v.485; Ap.i.64f).</p>
<p>These questions were elaborated by 
the nun of Kajangalā (see A.v.54ff). (q.v.). </p>
<p>The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.636) on 
the Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta seems to indicate a set of questions called 
Kumārapañha in connection with Rāhula when he was seven years old.</p>
<p>See also SA.iii.99, where Buddhaghosa 
says that Cittagahapati, in a discussion with Nigantha Nātaputta, referred to 
the Kumārapañha.</p>
