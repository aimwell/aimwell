  <h2>Dhātuvibhanga Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached to 
<a href="pukkusati.htm" title="pu/pukkusati.htm">Pukkusāti</a>, whom the Buddha 
met at the house of <a href="bhaggava.htm" title="b/bhaggava.htm">Bhaggava</a> the potter. It deals with the six elements of 
earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness.</p>
<p>Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha by his 
preaching and, at the end of the sermon, wished to be ordained. The Buddha asked 
him to fetch a bowl and robe. On his way to fetch these, Pukkusāti was killed by 
a mad cow (M.iii.248ff).</p>
<p>This sutta forms the suttanta 
counterpart of the Vibhanga.</p>
