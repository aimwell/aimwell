<p><b>1. Yāmā. </b>A class of Devas, mentioned in lists of 
devas between those of Tāvatimsa and those of Tusita (E.g., Vin.i.12, A.i.228; 
iii.287; M.ii.194; iii.100, etc.). Two hundred years of human life are but one 
day to the Yāma devā, and two thousand Years, composed of such days, form their 
life period (A.i.213; iv.253). Sirimā, sister of Jīvaka, was born after death in 
the Yāma world and became the wife of Suyāma, king of</p>
<p>Yāmabhavana. From there she visited the Buddha with five 
hundred others. SNA i.244f.; see also VvA.246 for an upāsaka born in the Yāma-world. 
In the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.475) mention is made of four Yāma-devas who were 
reborn as men. </p>
<p>The meaning of Yāmā is explained in the Commentaries 
(E.g., VibhA.519; PSA.441) as “those that have attained divine bliss” (dibbam 
sukham yātā payātā sampattā ti Yāmā). Other explanations are “misery freed” or 
“governing gods”. Compendium, p.138, n.2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Yāmā.</b> In some contexts, Yāmā seems to have been 
derived from Yama, king of the underworld — e.g 
in such expressions as “Yāmato yāva Akanittham” (From the underworld to the 
highest heaven). KhA.166.</p>
