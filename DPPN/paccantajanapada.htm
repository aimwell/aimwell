<p>In the texts contrast is often drawn between the 
Paccantajanapada and the Majjhimadesa. In the latter the fortunate ones are 
born, and it is a great disadvantage to be born outside it; for, then, the 
possibilities of hearing of the Buddha and his teaching become remote (E.g., 
DhA.iii.248, 489; KhA.133). </p>
<p>The boundaries of the Majjhimadesa are given in several 
places, and the Paccantajanapada, lies beyond these boundaries. They are: in the 
east, Kajangala and Mahāsālā; in the south east, the river Salalavatī; in the 
south, Setakannikā; in the west, Thūna; and in the north, Usīraddhaja (pabbata) 
(Vin.i.197; J.i.49; cp. Dvy.21f). </p>
<p>The Vinaya rules were relaxed in the case of those who 
lived in the Paccantajanapada, where it is said that the Buddha never spent a 
night. MA.ii.982.</p>
