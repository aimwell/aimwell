<p>A householder (gahapati) of 
<a href="a5_az.htm#Atthakanagara" title="aa/a5_az.htm#Atthakanagara">Atthakanagara</a>. One day, having finished some business which took him to 
<a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaliputta</a>, he visited the Kukkutārāma to call upon 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>. Learning that 
Ānanda was at <a href="beluva.htm" title="b/beluva.htm">Beluvagāma</a> near 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, he visited him there and held a discussion 
with him, which is recorded in the <a href="atthaka_naagara_s.htm" title="ay/atthaka_naagara_s.htm">Atthakanāgara Sutta</a>. Later, assembling the 
monks from Pātaliputta and Vesāli, he entertained them and presented each with 
two lengths of cloth, while to Ānanda he gave a suit of three robes and built 
for him a cell costing five hundred pieces (M.i.349ff; A.v.342ff).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) 
that Dasama was so called because in the order of precedence with regard to 
aristocracy of birth and wealth, he occupied the tenth rank.</p>
