<p><b>1. Ambalatthikā.</b>-A royal park on the 
road between <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>. It contained a royal rest-house (rājāgāraka) 
in which the Buddha and members of the Order used to stay in the course of their 
journeying. It was on one such occasion that the <a href="brahmajala_s.htm" title="b/brahmajala_s.htm">Brahmajāla Sutta</a> was preached 
(Vin.ii.287; D.i.1). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.41-2) says that it was a shady and 
well-watered park, so called because of a mango sapling which stood by the 
gateway. It was surrounded and well guarded by a rampart, and its rest-house was 
adorned with paintings for the king’s amusement.</p>
<p>It was one of the spots in which the 
Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he 
discoursed to a large number of monks (D.ii.81; he remained there one night, 
UdA.408). But the most famous of the Buddha’s sermons in Ambalatthikā seems to 
have been the <a href="raahulovaada_s.htm" title="r/raahulovaada_s.htm">Rāhulovāda Sutta</a> named Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta, because of 
its having been preached in the park (M.i.414ff). From the context it appears as 
though Ambalatthikā was within walking distance from the Kalandakanivāpa in 
Rājagaha.</p>
<p>But see below (4) for a more probable 
explanation.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Ambalatthikā.</b>-A park in the brahmin 
village Khānumata. The Buddha went there during one of his tours through 
Magadha. On this occasion was preached the <a href="kuutadanta_s.htm" title="ku/kuutadanta_s.htm">Kūtadanta Sutta</a> (D.i.127). 
Buddhaghosa (DA.i.294) says the park was like the pleasance of the same name 
between Rājagaha and Nālandā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Ambalatthikā.</b>-There was a place of 
this name to the east of the Lohapāsāda in Anurādhapura. Once when the 
Dīghabhānaka Theras recited the Brahmajāla Sutta there, the earth trembled from 
the water upwards (DA.i.131).</p>
<p>On another occasion King Vasabha heard 
the Dīghabhānakas reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta, and thinking that they were 
discussing what they had eaten and drunk, he approached closer to listen; when 
he discovered the truth he applauded the monks (DA.ii.635).</p>
<p>The place referred to here was probably 
not a park, but a building which formed part of the Lohapāsāda. In the Mahāvamsa 
account (Mhv.xxvii.11-20) of the building of the Lohapāsāda we are told that the 
plans were copied from the gem-palace of the goddess Bīranī. The central part of 
the palace was called the Ambalatthikapāsāda. “It was visible from every side, 
bright, with pennons hung out.”</p>
<p>Dutthagāmani probably included a similar 
central part in the Lohapāsāda. This view is strengthened by No. 4 below.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Ambalatthikā.</b>-According to 
Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.635), the Ambalatthikā, in which the 
<a href="raahulovaada_s.htm" title="r/raahulovaada_s.htm">Rāhulovāda Sutta</a> of that 
name was preached, was not a pleasance, but a pāsāda, a kind of meditation hall 
(padhānagharasankhepa) built in the outskirts of Veluvanavihāra for the use of 
those who desired solitude. It is said that <a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula</a> spent most of his time there, 
from the day of his ordination as a seven-year-old boy.</p>
