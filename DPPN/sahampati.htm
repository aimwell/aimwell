<p>A Mahābrahmā. When the Buddha was at the Ajapālanigrodha, 
hesitating as to whether or not he should preach the Dhamma, Sahampati appeared 
before him and begged of him to open to the world the doors of Immortality. The 
Buddha agreed to this urgent request (Vin.i.5f.;S.i.137f), and accepted from 
Sahampati the assurance that all the Buddhas of the past had also had no other 
teacher than the Dhamma discovered by them. S.i.139; see also S.v.167f.,185, 
232, where he gives the same assurance to the Buddha regarding the four 
satipatthānas and the five indriyas; A.ii.10f.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa (E.g., SA.i.155) explains that the Buddha was 
reluctant to preach, not on account of indolence, but because he wished 
Sahampati to make him this request. For, thought the Buddha, the world honours 
Brahmā greatly, and when people realized that Brahmā himself had begged of the 
Buddha to spread his teaching, they would pay more attention to it. Sahampati 
was, at this time, the most senior of the Brahmās (jettha-Mahābrahmā) 
(DA.ii.467).</p>
<p>Sahampati once saw that the brahminee, mother of 
Brahmadeva Thera, habitually made offerings to Brahmā. Out of compassion for 
her, Sahampati appeared before her and exhorted her to give her offerings to 
Brahmadeva instead (S.i.140f). On another occasion, when Kokāliya died and was 
born in Padumaniraya, Sahampati appeared before the Buddha and announced the 
fact to him (SN. p.125; cp. S.i.151; A.v.172). The Samyutta (S.i.154f) contains 
a series of verses spoken by Sahampati at Andhakavinda, when the Buddha sat out 
in the open during the night and rain fell drop by drop. The verses are in 
praise of the life and practices of the monks and of the results thereof. 
Sahampati again visited the Buddha, simultaneously with Sakka, and as they stood 
leaning against a doorpost of the Buddha’s cell, Sakka uttered a verse in praise 
of the Buddha. Sahampati then added another verse, exhorting the Buddha to 
preach the Doctrine, as there were those who would understand (S.i.233). A verse 
spoken by him immediately after the Buddha’s death is included in the books 
(D.ii.157; S.i.158).</p>
<p>During the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sahampati was a monk, 
named Sahaka, who, having practised the five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), was reborn 
in the Brahma world. Thereafter he was called Sahampati (S.v.233). The 
Commentaries say (SNA.ii.476; SA.i.155) that he was an Anāgāmī Brahmā born in 
the Suddhāvāsā, there to pass a whole kappa, because he had developed the first 
Jhāna as a monk. The Buddhavamsa, Commentary (BuA.p.11; see also p.29) says 
that, strictly speaking, his name should be “Sahakapati.” When the Buddha 
attained Enlightenment, Sahampati held over the Buddha’s head a white parasol 
three yojanas in diameter. BuA.239; this incident was sculptured in the Relic 
Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.74); cp. J.iv.266. </p>
<p>Once he offered to the Buddha a chain of jewels (ratanadāma) 
as large as Sineru (KhA.171; Sp.i.115; Vsm.201). On the day that Alindakavāsi 
Mahāphussadeva attained arahantship, Sahampati came to wait upon him 
(VibhA.352).</p>
<p>It has been suggested (VT.i.86, n.1) that Brahmā Sahampati 
is very probably connected with Brahmi Svayambhū of brahmanical literature.</p>
