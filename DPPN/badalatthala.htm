  <h2>Badalatthala, Badalatthalī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A locality in the Dakkhinadesa of Ceylon (Cv.lviii.42; 
lxv.26). </p>
<p>It was the abode of the senāpati Sankha, who was killed 
there (Cv.lxiv.9). Nearby was Pilimvatthu (Cv.lxv.4); it was to Badalatthala 
that the young Parakkamabāhu first came when he escaped from his custodians. 
From there he went to Buddhagāma (Cv.lxvi.19), and later returned to 
Baddalatthala in order to meet his mother, Ratanāvalī, and the senāpati Deva, 
that he might visit his father with them (Cv.lxvii.81).</p>
