<p>Preached in the Pārāvārika-ambavana in 
Nālandā. Kevatta (1) visits the Buddha and asks him to order a monk to perform 
some mystic wonder in order to increase the faith of the Buddha’s followers. The 
Buddha expresses his hatred of miracles and tells Kevatta that a greater and 
better wonder than any or all of them is education in the system of 
self-training which culminates in Arahantship. In illustration of this, he 
relates a legend: A monk, seeking the answer to the question “Where do the 
elements pass away?” goes up and up, by the power of his iddhi, from world to 
world, asking the gods for an answer. In each heaven he is referred to those who 
are higher up, until he comes at last to the Great Brahmā himself, who takes him 
aside and tells him that he does not know the answer. </p>
<p>The monk seeks the Buddha, who explains 
to him that the question is wrongly put; it should be, “Where do the elements 
find no foothold; where do nāma and rūpa pass away?” And the answer is, “In the 
mind of the arahant, when intellect (viññāna) ceases, then nāma and rūpa cease.”
