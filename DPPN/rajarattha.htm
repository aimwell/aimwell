<p>The name given to the northern part of Ceylon, with Pulatthipura as centre, 
as opposed to Rohana (E.g., Cv.lxx.184f ) and Dakkhinadesa (Cv.lxxii.176<span lang="en-us">-9). 
Later, the name was changed to Patitthārattha (E.g., Cv.lxxxii.26). </p>
<p>Rājarattha was the scene of many conflicts between the Singhalese and the 
invaders who came from time to time from South India, till, in the end, it was 
abandoned, and the Singhalese capital moved southwards. Rājarattha was also 
called Rājinorattha. E.g., Cv.lii.4.</p>
