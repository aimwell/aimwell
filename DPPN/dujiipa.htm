</ul>
<p>A king who lived to the age of one 
thousand. He reigned for five hundred years and, at the end of that period, gave 
alms to the brahmins, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic (J.vi.203).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Dud朝pa, 
king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, who is mentioned (J.vi.99) as having given away great wealth, 
and as a result reached heaven. v.l. Dud朝pa.</p>
