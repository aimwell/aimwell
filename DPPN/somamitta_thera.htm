  <h2>Somamitta Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a brahmin family of Benares and was expert 
in the Vedas. Later, owing to his association with Vimala Thera, he entered the 
Order and lived with him. (But according to ThagA.i.377, Vimala was ordained by 
Somamitta). But finding Vimala given to sloth and laziness, Somamitta left him 
and joined Mahā Kassapa, under whose direction he soon attained arahantship. 
Later he visited Vimala and rebuked him. Vimala then put forth effort and became 
an arahant.</p>
<p>Somamitta was a householder in the time of Sikhī Buddha, 
and, very pleased with the Buddha, he picked some kimsuka-flowers from a tree 
and offered them to him (Thag.vs.147f ; ThagA.i.267f).</p>
<p>He is perhaps identical with Kimsukapupphiya Thera of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.435; but see ThagA.i.87.</p>
