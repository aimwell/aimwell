<p>A grove to the south of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, one gāvuta away from the city. It was well guarded and monks and nuns used to resort 
there in search of solitude. During the time of <a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa Buddha</a>, thieves waylaid 
an anāgāmī upāsaka in this forest; his name was Sorata (<a href="yasodhara.htm" title="y/yasodhara.htm">Yasodhara</a>, according to 
the Samyutta Cy), and he had been touring <a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a> collecting money for the 
Buddha’s cetiya. They gouged out his eyes and killed him. Thereupon the robbers 
all lost their sight and wandered about the forest blind; hence the name of the 
forest (“Blind,” usually, but wrongly, translated “Dark”). It had retained its 
name during two Buddha-periods. The story is given in MA.i.336ff. and SA.i.148.</p>
<p>There was a Meditation Hall (padhāna-ghara) 
built there for the use of contemplative monks and nuns (MA.i.338). Stories are 
told of those, particularly the nuns, who were tempted by 
<a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> in the Andhavana. 
E.g., <a href="aalavakaa.htm" title="aa/aalavakaa.htm">Ālavikā</a>, <a href="somaa.htm" title="s/somaa.htm">Soma</a>,
<a href="kisaagotamii.htm" title="ku/kisaagotamii.htm">Kisāgotamī</a>, 
<a href="vijayaa_theri.htm" title="vy/vijayaa_theri.htm">Vijayā</a>, <a href="uppalavannaa.htm" title="u/uppalavannaa.htm">Uppalavannā</a>, 
<a href="caalaa.htm" title="c/caalaa.htm">Cālā</a>, <a href="upacaalaa.htm" title="u/upacaalaa.htm">Upacālā</a>, 
<a href="sisupacala_theri.htm" title="s/sisupacala_theri.htm">Sisūpacālā</a>, 
<a href="selaa.htm" title="s/selaa.htm">Selā</a>, <a href="vajiraa.htm" title="va/vajiraa.htm">Vajirā</a>; J.i.128ff. and ThigA.64, 66, 163.</p>
<p>Once when <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was staying there he 
became seriously sick (S.v.302). It was here that the Buddha preached to 
<a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula</a> 
the discourse (<a href="cuula_rahulovaada_s.htm" title="c/cuula_rahulovaada_s.htm">Cūla-Rāhulovāda</a>) which made him an arahant (S.iv.105-7; 
AA.i.145).</p>
<p>Among others who lived here from time to 
time are mentioned the Elders <a href="khema.htm" title="ku/khema.htm">Khema</a>, 
<a href="soma.htm" title="s/soma.htm">Soma</a> (A.iii.358), and <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> (A.v.9), 
the last-mentioned experiencing a special kind of samādhi (where he realised 
that bhavanirodha was nibbāna).</p>
<p>The Theragātha Commentary (i.39) records 
a discussion here between Sāriputta and <a href="punna.htm" title="pu/punna.htm">Punna</a> regarding purification (visuddhikamma). 
The <a href="vammiika_sutta.htm" title="va/vammiika_sutta.htm">Vammikā Sutta</a> (M.i.143ff ) was the result of questions put by an anāgami 
Brahma, his erstwhile colleague, to <a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kumāra-kassapa</a>, while he was in Andhavana.</p>
<p>Once bandits laid an ambush for <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> 
as he went through the forest to pay his respects to the Buddha, attended by a 
small escort, as was sometimes his wont. He was warned in time and had the wood 
surrounded, capturing and impaling or crucifying the bandits on either side of 
the road through the wood. We are told that though the Buddha knew of this, he 
did not chide the king because he had certain reasons for not doing so. (See 
SA.i.131-2. Mrs. Rhys Davids doubts the authenticity of this story; KS.i.127n.)</p>
<p>The Therī <a href="uppalavannaa.htm" title="u/uppalavannaa.htm">Uppalavannā</a> was raped in a hut 
in the forest by a young brahmin named Ānanda, and it is said that from that 
time nuns did not live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49, 52).</p>
<p>The Pārājikā (Vin.iii.28ff ) contains 
stories of monks who committed offences in the forest with shepherdesses and 
others, and also of some monks who ate the flesh of a cow which had been left 
behind, partly eaten, by cattle thieves (Vin.iii.64). It was here that 
Uppalavannā obtained the piece of cow’s flesh which she asked Udāyi to offer to 
the Buddha, giving Udāyi her inner robe as “wages” for the job (the story is 
told in Vin.iii.208-9).</p>
<p>The Pārichattakavimāna (VvA.172ff ) was 
the abode which fell to the lot of a woman who having plucked an asoka-flower, 
while getting firewood in Andhavana, offered it to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The rule forbidding monks to enter a 
village clad only in their waist cloth and nether garment was made with 
reference to a monk whose robe had been stolen by thieves in Andhavana 
(Vin.i.298).</p>
