<p>A shrine near Vesāli. (D.ii.102; Ud.vi.1; S.v.259; 
A.iv.309, etc.). It was so called because, in the past, seven princesses, 
daughters of Kiki, king of Benares, left Rājagaha and fought for attainment at 
that spot. It was originally dedicated to some deity, but after the Buddha’s 
visit to Vesāli, it became a place of residence for him (UdA.323, etc.). It was 
to the west of Vesāli. D.iii.9.</p>
