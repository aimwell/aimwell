<p>1. Jayabāhu.-King of Ceylon (1114-1116 
A.C.). He was a brother of Vijayabāhu I., who made him ādipāda and gave him 
Rohana (Cv.lix.12). He married his step-sister Sumittā (Cv.lix.43) and was later 
made uparāja (Cv.lx.87). On the death of Vijayabāhu, Jayabāhu became king with 
the help of the Pāndyan faction of the royal family and appointed, “contrary to 
former custom,” Mānābharana as his uparāja. The latter, however, seems to have 
been the virtual king; his attempts to attack Vikkamabāhu, the lawful uparāja, 
ended in disaster, and Vikkamabāhu captured the capital, Pulatthipura, whereupon 
Jayabāhu retired to Rohana. He lived there as nominal sovereign and died in 
obscurity (Cv.lxi).</p>
<p>2. Jayabāhu.-A Tamil usurper who, with 
Māgha, seems to have been in possession of the north of Ceylon and the capital 
at Pulatthipura for many years, both before and during the reign of 
Parakkamabāhu II. Cv.lxxxii.87; lxxxiii.15ff.</p>
<p>3. Jayabāhu.-Youngest of the five sons 
of Parakkamabāhu II. He lived with his father and helped in the administration. 
Cv.lxxxvii.17; lxxxviii.19.</p>
<p>4. Jayabāhu.-Grandson of Parakkamabāhu 
VI., whom he is said to have succeeded, but nothing further is known of him 
except that he was murdered by Bhuvanekabāhu (vi.). Cv.xcii.1.</p>
<p>5. Jayabāhu.-A thera of Ceylon, better 
known as Devarakkhita or Dhammakitti. He was Sangharāja and composed the 
Nikāyasangraha. P.L.C.242f.</p>
