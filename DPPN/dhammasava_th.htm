<p>An arahant. He was a brahmin of Magadha 
who, having heard the Buddha preach at Dakkhināgiri, entered the Order.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a brahmin ascetic named Suvaccha, versed in the three Vedas. The Buddha appeared 
before him, and he paid him homage by scattering nāga-flowers in his path. 
Thirty-one kappas ago he was a king named Mahāratha (Thag.107; ThagA.i.214f).
</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Nāgapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.i.179.</p>
