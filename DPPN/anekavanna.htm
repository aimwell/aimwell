<p>A devaputta in Tāvatimsa, who, because 
of his good deeds, excelled even Sakka in majesty. When he appeared in the 
streets of Tāvatimsa, Sakka fled in shame (DhA.i.426-7).</p>
<p>The Vimānavatthu (pp.74-5; VvA.318ff ) 
gives his past story which he revealed to Moggallāna. He had been a monk under 
Sumedha Buddha, but later, feeling disheartened, left the Order. When the Buddha 
died he was seized with repentance for having lost his opportunity, and paid 
homage to the Buddha’s shrine and observed the precepts.</p>
