<h2>Mahālatā pasādhana (-pilandhana)</h2>
<p>A very costly ornament of gold. In the time of the Buddha 
it was possessed only by three persons: Bandhula’s wife, Mallikā, Visākhā and 
Devadāniyacora (DA.ii.599; at DhA.i.412 the daughter of the treasurer of Benares 
is substituted for Devadāniya). Visākhā once left it behind in the monastery, 
where she had gone to hear the Buddha preach, and when she sent her slave girl 
for it Ānanda had already put it away. She, thereupon, refused to take it back 
and had it sold. It was worth nine crores, the workmanship being worth one 
hundred thousand. No one was found able to buy it, so Visākhā herself paid the 
price for it, and, with the proceeds, erected the Migāramātupāsāda 
(DhA.i.411ff). Mallikā, after the death of her husband, refused to wear her 
jewels, and, when the Buddha’s body was being taken for cremation, she washed 
her ornament in scented water and placed it on the Buddha’s bier with the 
following resolve: ” May I, in future births, have a body that shall need no 
ornaments, but which shall appear as though it always bore them (DA.ii.597).</p>
<p>The making of Visākhā’s ornament took four months, with 
five hundred goldsmiths working day and night. In its construction were used 
four pint pots (nāli) of diamonds, eleven of pearls, twenty two of coral, thirty 
three of rubies, one thousand nikkhas of ruddy gold, and sufficient silver. The 
thread work was entirely of silver, the parure was fastened to the head and 
extended to the feet. In various places, seals of gold and dies of silver were 
attached to hold it in position. In the fabric itself was a peacock with five 
hundred feathers of gold in either wing, a coral beak, jewels for the eyes, the 
neck feathers and the tail. As the wearer walked the feathers moved, producing 
the sound of music. Only a woman possessed of the strength of five elephants 
could wear it. DbA.i.393ff. MA.i.471.</p>
