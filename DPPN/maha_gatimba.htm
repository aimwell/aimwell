<p><b>Mahāgatimba-Abhaya</b> Thera. Mentioned among those 
  who could remember early incidents in their lives. When he was five days old 
  he saw a crow pecking at some milk rice prepared for a ceremony and made a 
  sound to drive it away. This was the earliest recollection of the Thera. He 
  had a beautiful complexion. DA.ii.530; MNidA.234. AA.ii.596.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Mahāgatimbya-Tissadatta</b> (v.l. Mahāgatigamiya 
  Tissadatta). A Thera. He once went over from Ceylon to India to worship the 
  Bodhi tree. While crossing, seeing only the waters round him, he fell to 
  wondering which was the more extraordinary, the sound of the ocean waves or 
  the method of the twenty four divisions of the Patthāna. The limits of the 
  great ocean then became apparent to him. DhSA. p. 11.</p>
