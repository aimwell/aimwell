<p>v.l. Pārāpata. The Bodhisatta was once born its king of a flock of pigeons. 
For a long time they visited regularly a good ascetic in a cave near by, until, 
one day, he left and his place was taken by a sham ascetic. The pigeons 
continued their visits, till one day the villagers served the ascetic with a 
dish of pigeon’s flesh, and he, liking the flavour, conceived the desire to kill 
the pigeons. The Bodhisatta, suspecting his intentions, warned his followers and 
charged the ascetic with hypocrisy. J.ii.382 4; cp. Godha Jātaka (No. 325).</p>
