<p><b>1. Vanavaccha Thera.</b> He was the son of Vacchagotta 
a brahmin of Kapilavatthu, and was born in the forest, his mother having longed 
to see it and having been taken in travail while wandering there. His name was 
Vaccha; but because of his love for the woods, he was called Vanavaccha. He left 
the world soon after the Buddha’s Renunciation, and led the ascetic life till he 
heard of the Buddha’s Enlightenment. Then he joined the Order, and it was in the 
forest that he strove and won arahantship. When he returned to Kapilavatthu with 
the Buddha, his companions asked him why he so loved the forest, and he spoke a 
verse in praise of forest life (Thag.13).</p>
<p>In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he was a large tortoise 
living in the Vinatā. Seeing the Buddha about to cross the river, he took him on 
his back. Many hundreds of times afterwards he lived as an ascetic in the 
forest. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he became a dove, and his heart was 
gladdened by the sight of a monk practicing compassion. Later he was born as a 
householder in Benares and renounced the world. ThagA.i.58f.; Ap.ii.506f.</p>

<p><b>2. Vanavaccha Thera.</b> The son of a rich brahmin of 
Rājagaha; he joined the Order, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha’s visit to 
Bimbisāra. Soon after, he attained arahantship and, devoted to detachment, dwelt 
in the woods hence his name. When he went to Rājagaha his kinsmen asked him to 
live near them, but he said he preferred the lonely life of the forest 
(Thag.113).</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a labourer, and, 
having committed a crime, while fleeing from justice he saw a Bodhi tree. 
Pleased with the look of the tree, he gathered masses of asoka flowers and 
heaped them up round the tree. When his pursuers reached him, he remained as he 
was, looking at them, with no hatred in his heart. They hurled him into a 
precipice, and he died with the thought of the Bodhi tree in his heart. Three 
kappas ago he was a king named Santusita (ThagA.i.222). He is perhaps identical 
with Tambapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.i.176.</p>
