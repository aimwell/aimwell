<p>The Bodhisatta was born as a sprite, in 
a clump of kusa-grass. Hard by was a mukkhaka-tree in which lived a Tree-sprite. 
One day the king’s carpenter, looking for a suitable pillar for the king’s 
one-pillared palace, reluctantly decided to fell the mukkhaka. Learning of the 
Tree-sprite’s imminent danger, the Bodhisatta assumed the shape of a chameleon 
and deceived the carpenter in such a way that he saw the mukkhaka as all rotten 
and of no use for his purpose.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to one 
of Anāthapindika’s friends. He was of low rank and poor, and Anāthapindika’s 
other friends protested against such intimacy. But one day the poor friend saved 
Anāthapindika’s house from being burgled. The Buddha related the story to show 
how each, according to his strength, could help a friend in need (J.i.441ff).</p>
<p>Ānanda was the Tree-sprite. The story is 
often quoted (E.g., J.iv.77) to show the value of a good friend.</p>
