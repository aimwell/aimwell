<p>The lute carried by Pañcasikha (q.v.); it belonged 
originally to Māra. </p>
<p>When Māra, after wasting seven years trying in vain to 
discover some shortcoming in the Buddha <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
six years before the Enlightenment and one year after it 
<span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; left the Buddha in disgust 
and weariness, the lute which he carried slung on his shoulder slipped and fell. 
Sakka picked it up and gave it to Paññcasikha. It was so powerful that when 
plucked with the fingers the lovely music produced echoed on for four months 
(SNA.ii.393f). </p>
<p>The vīnā was three gāvutas in length (BuA.239) and had 
fifty trestles (AA.i.72). The Sumangala Vilāsinī (DA.iii.699) describes it at 
length. It was pale yellow, like a ripe beluva fruit. Its base (pokkhara) was of 
gold, its stem of sapphire its strings of silver, and its knots (vethikā) of 
coral. </p>
<p>The vīnā was probably so called partly because its base 
was made of a bilva-fruit, instead of the usual gourd, and partly because of its 
colour.</p>
