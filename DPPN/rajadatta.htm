<p>An arahant. He belonged to a caravan leader’s family of Sāvatthi, and was so 
called because he was born through the favour of Vessavana. When he came of age 
he took a caravan of five hundred carts to Rājagaha. Then, having squandered all 
his money, he went to Veluvana, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered 
the Order and lived in a charnel field. While wandering about, he saw the 
mangled body of a murdered courtesan and only with a great effort saved himself 
from distraction of mind. Later, he induced jhāna and won arahantship.</p>
<p>Fourteen kappas ago he had seen a Pacceka Buddha at the foot of a tree and 
had given him an ambātaka (mango?) fruit (Thag. vss. 315-19; ThagA.i.402f). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Ambātaka Thera. Ap.i.394.</p>
