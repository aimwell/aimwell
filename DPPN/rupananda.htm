<p>Called Janapadakalyāni Rūpanandā (DhA.iii.113ff). </p>
<p>She is evidently identical with Janapadakalyānī Nandā (At AA.i.198 she is 
actually identified with her, but see Sundarī Nandā) (q.v.), and is described as 
a sister (? step sister) of the Buddha. The person referred to as her husband (bhattā) 
is probably Nanda (q.v.), the Buddha’s step brother; strictly speaking, he 
joined the Order without having married her, though the wedding had been 
announced and all preparations were being made.</p>
