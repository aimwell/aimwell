<p>The name of a brahmin clan (gotta). The Samyutta Nikāya 
mentions a lady of the gotta living in Kāmandā, who was evidently a teacher. A 
pupil of hers (antevāsī māttavaka) having visited Udāyi, then staying in the 
Todeyya ambavana, told her of his excellences.</p>
<p>He was asked to invite Udāyī to a meal, and, when it was 
over, the teacher put on her sandals, sat on a high seat, and, with her head 
veiled, asked Udāyī to preach the doctrine. “A time will come for that, sister,” 
he said, and went away. Three times this happened, and then she told her pupil. 
He pointed out to her her mistake in not showing respect for the Doctrine. The 
next time Udāyī came, she approached him after the meal with all humility and 
asked him what, according to the arahants, was the cause of weal and woe. “The 
existence of the senses,” answered Udāyī; and she, expressing her satisfaction, 
declared herself a follower of Udāyī. S.iv.121f.</p>
