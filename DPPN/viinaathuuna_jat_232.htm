<p>The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant, and a marriage 
was arranged between his son and the daughter of a Benares merchant. In her 
parents' house, the girl saw honour being offered to a bull, and seeing a 
hunchback in the street on the day of her marriage, she thought him worthy of 
great honour (because of his hunch) and went away with him in disguise, carrying 
her jewellery. The Bodhisatta’s friends saw her, and persuading her of her 
folly, took her back home.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a rich girl of Sāvatthi 
who went away with a hunchback in similar circumstances. The girls of both 
stories were the same. J.ii.224f.</p>
