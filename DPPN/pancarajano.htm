  <h2>Pañcarājāno Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once five rājās, with Pasenadi as their chief, were 
indulging in various forms of amusement and they fell to discussing among 
themselves as to which of the sense pleasures was the highest. Unable to come to 
any decision, they sought the Buddha, who explained that the highest pleasure, 
in the case of any of the senses, was the limit point 
in anyone’s enjoyment. A lay disciple, Candanangalika, who was present, 
thereupon rose from his seat and uttered a stanza in praise of the Buddha. The 
five rājās wrapped their robes around the disciple, and he, in turn, presented 
these to the Buddha. S.i.79f.</p>
