  <h2>Bharu Jātaka (No.213)</h2>

<p>Once the Bodhisatta was leader of a band of five hundred 
ascetics in Himavā. One day they came to the city of Bharu for salt and vinegar, 
and took up their residence under a banyan-tree to the north of the city. A 
similar group remained under a tree to the south. Next year, the tree to the 
south of the city was found to have withered away, and the group who had lived 
there, having arrived first, took possession of the other tree, to the north. 
This led to a dispute between the two groups, and they sought the intervention 
of Bharu, king of the Bharu country. He decided in favour of one group, but 
being bribed by the other, he changed his mind. Later, the ascetics repented of 
their greed and hastened back to Himavā. The gods, angry with the king, 
submerged the whole of Bharu, three hundred leagues in extent, under the sea.</p>
<p>The story was told to Pasenadi, king of Kosala, who took 
bribes from some heretics and gave permission for them to build a centre near 
Jetavana. When the Buddha heard of it, he sent monks to interview the king, but 
the latter refused to receive even the Chief Disciples. The Buddha then went 
himself and dissuaded the king from giving permission for an act which would 
lead to endless dissensions. </p>
<p>J.ii.169ff.; the story is also given at SA.iii.218 f., 
which says further that Pasenadi built the Rājakārāma to make amends for his 
fault.</p>
