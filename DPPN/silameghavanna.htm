<p>King of Ceylon, He was the son of the senāpati of 
Moggallāna III. and held the office of sword bearer. He rebelled against the 
king and killed him at Sīhagiri. Then he killed Dalla-Moggallāna and became king 
of Anurādhapura, reigning for nine years (617-626 A.C.).</p>
<p>Urged by a monk, named Bodhi, he proclaimed a regulation 
act against the undisciplined monks of Abhayagiri; but these monks murdered 
Bodhi and were severely punished by the king. Later he quarrelled with the 
Theravāda monks and retired to Dakkhinadesa, where he died (Cv.xliv. 43, 53ff). 
Aggibodhi III. and Kassapa II. were his sons. He was also evidently known as 
Silādātha. See Cv.xlv.51; also Cv.Trs.94, n.1.</p>
