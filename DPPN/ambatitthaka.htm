<p>1. Ambatitthaka.-A Tamil stronghold 
surrounded by a river and a moat; it was captured by Dutthagāmani after a siege 
of four months (Mhv.xxv.7-9). The crafty Damila Titthamba lived there, and it is 
said that, in the end, he was conquered by a conspiracy in which Dutthagāmani 
offered to allow him to marry Dutthagāmani’s mother (MT.473f). Near here was a 
ford across the Mahāvāluka-gangā.</p>
