<p><b>1. Asita Devala.</b>-A sage (isi). His story 
is given in the <a href="assalaayana.htm" title="ay/assalaayana.htm">Assalāyana Sutta</a> (M.ii.154ff). Once there were seven brahmin 
sages living in thatched cabins in the wilds. They conceived the view that the 
brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate 
sons of Brahma. Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in 
orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them. The brahmins 
cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more 
they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita. Feeling that their 
austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to 
discard their delusion. Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished 
to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their 
pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer. They 
thereupon followed his advice and renounced their claims to superiority.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says that Asita Devala was 
the Bodhisatta. MA.ii.785.</p>

<p><b>2. Asita Devala.</b>-More commonly called Kāla Devala, probably identical with (1) above, and mentioned in the 
<a href="indriya_jat_423.htm" title="i_/indriya_jat_423.htm">Indriya 
Jātaka</a> (J.iii.463ff). He was one of the seven chief disciples of the Bodhisatta
<a href="sarabhanga.htm" title="sa/sarabhanga.htm">Sarabhanga</a> and lived with many thousand sages in 
<a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a> Dakkhināpatha. He had a 
younger brother Nārada, also an ascetic, who lived in Arañjara. When Nārada 
became enamoured of a courtesan on the river-bank near Arañjara, Kāla Devala 
flew to him, and in due course brought Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara to 
admonish him. When they, too, failed in their efforts to convert Nārada, Kāla 
Devala brought the master of all sages, Sarabhanga, who with their help 
persuaded Nārada to give up his love.</p>
<p>In this present age Kāla Devala became 
Mahā Kaccana (J.iii.469).</p>
