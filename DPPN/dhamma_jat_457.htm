  <h2>Dhamma Jātaka (No.457)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta once became a Kāmāvacara-god, 
named Dhamma, and Devadatta became Adhamma. On uposatha-days Dhamma would appear 
among men and urge them to lead virtuous lives, while Adhamma encouraged them in 
wickedness. One day, their two chariots meeting in mid-air, they each claimed 
the right of way. But at the end of the argument Adhamma’s chariot fell headlong 
to earth, where he was swallowed up into hell. The story was related in 
reference to Devadatta’s being swallowed up in Avīci. J.iv.100-4.</p>
