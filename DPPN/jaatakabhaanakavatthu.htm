  <h2>Jātakabhānakavatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.484) 
mention the story of a certain reciter of the Jātakas who once went begging to a 
house. The mistress of the house, not wishing to give, went in and returned 
saying she could not find any rice. The monk observed that there were other 
eatables in the house, and indicated to the woman, by means of a riddle, what he 
had seen.</p>
