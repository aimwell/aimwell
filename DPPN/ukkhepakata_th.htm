  <h2>Ukkhepakata-Vaccha Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was the son of a brahmin of the 
Vaccha family. Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and dwelt in 
a village settlement in Kosala. He learnt the doctrine from the various monks 
who came there from time to time, but it was not until he learnt from Sāriputta 
that he was able to distinguish between Sutta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma. He thus 
became versed in the Three Pitakas even before the First Council (On this see 
Brethren, p.66. n.1). He practised meditation and soon attained arahantship 
(Thag.v.65; ThagA.i.147f). Later he became a teacher of the doctrine. According 
to Dhammapāla (ThagA.i.149), the soubriquet Ukkhepakata was given to him because 
he was able to teach and recite passages from the three Pitakas “casting them in 
their proper setting, according as they belonged to each Pitaka.” The title was 
meant to emphasise his eminent repertory of orally-learnt doctrine.</p>
<p>He had been a householder in the time of 
the Buddha Siddhattha and had helped a guild who built a hall for the Buddha by 
giving them a pillar for the building.</p>
<p>Fifty-five kappas ago he was a king 
named Yasodhara and twenty-one kappas ago another king named Udena. His 
seven-storied palaces were all built on one pillar. He is probably to be 
identified with Ekatthambhika Thera of the Apadāna (i.56-7).</p>
