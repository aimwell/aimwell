<p>1. Ajjuna-Thera. Son of a councillor of 
Sāvatthi. In his youth he first joined the Order of the Niganthas; being 
dissatisfied, he was won over by the Buddha’s Twin-miracle and, entering the 
Order, reached arahantship (Thag.v.88; ThagA.i.186). He is evidently to be 
identified with Sālapupphadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (i.169). </p>
<p>In Vipassī Buddha’s time he was born as 
a lion and gave the Buddha a flowering branch of a sala-tree.</p>
<p>He was also once a cakkavattī, named 
Verocana.</p>

and his thousand arms (J.v.267). In the Sarabhanga Jātaka he is mentioned as 
having sinned against Angīrasa (J.v.135; also DA.i.266). He is identified with 
Arjuna, called Kārtavīraya of the Kathāsaritsāgara (ii.639), and in the 
Uttarakanda of the Rāmāyana (Sarga 32).</p>
<p>He used to offer sacrifices to the gods 
(J.vi.201).</p>

(J.v.427).</p>
