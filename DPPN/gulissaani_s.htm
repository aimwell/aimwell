<p>Sāriputta notices among the monks at 
Rājagaha an uncouth monk from the wilds who is named Gulissāni. Sāriputta 
proceeds to talk to the other monks of the duties of a bhikkhu who, coming from 
the wilds, starts to live in the confraternity; he should show respect and 
consideration to others, be correct in the matter of seats, observe certain 
rules in begging for alms, and keep watch over his faculties while studying the 
higher Dhamma and Vinaya. Moggallāna asks whether these duties are incumbent 
only on those monks who come from the wilds, and is told that they are still 
more so on monks living in villages. M.i.469ff</p>
