pleasaunce near by, Paduma Buddha spent a rainy season. The citizens gave a 
special kathina-robe to his chief disciple, Sāla (BuA.148). According to the 
Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.173), Piyadassī Buddha preached his first sermon in 
the same pleasaunce, but the Buddhavamsa (xiv.119) gives its name as Ussāvana.</p>

Buddha Vessabhū died, at the Khemārāma. BuA.209.</p>
