  <h2>Kākātī Jātaka (No.327)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Kākātī was the chief queen of the King 
of Benares (the Bodhisatta). A certain <a href="garudaa.htm" title="g/garudaa.htm">Garuda</a> king came disguised as a man and 
played at dice with the king. Having fallen in love with Kākātī, the Garuda 
carried her off to his abode by the Simbalī-Lake and there lived with her. The 
king, missing his queen, sent his physician, Natakuvera, to look for her. The 
physician hid himself in the Garuda’s plumage and thus reached the palace where 
Kākātī was. There he enjoyed her favour and returned to Benares in the Garuda’s 
wing. While the Garuda and the king were playing at dice, Natakuvera sang a song 
telling of his experiences with Kākātī. The Garuda, realising what had happened, 
brought the queen back to Benares.</p>
<p>The story was related by the Buddha to a 
monk who was discontented on account of a woman. The monk is identified with 
Natakuvera (J.iii.90-2).</p>
<p>The story is among those related by the 
bird Kunāla, in the <a href="kunaala_jat_536.htm" title="ku/kunaala_jat_536.htm">Kunāla Jātaka</a>. There (J.v.428) we learn that the Garuda’s 
name was Venateyya, who is identified with Kunāla.</p>
<p>The Kākātī Jātaka very closely resembles 
the <a href="sussondii_jat_360.htm" title="s/sussondii_jat_360.htm">Sussondī Jātaka</a>. J.iii.187ff.</p>
