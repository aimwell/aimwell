<hr>
<p><b>1. Rāma. </b>A brahmin, skilled in physiognomy. He was one of the eight 
consulted by Suddhodana regarding his son, the future Buddha. J.i.56; Mil.236.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Rāma. </b>King of Benares. He suffered from a virulent skin disease, 
and, leaving his kingdom to his eldest son, went into the forest, where he was 
cured by eating medicinal herbs. In the forest he met and married Piyā, the 
eldest daughter of Okkāka. She suffered from the same complaint, and was cured 
by him. They lived in the forest with their thirty two children. A forester 
recognized Rāma in the forest, and, on his return to the city, told the news to 
the king. The king went to the forest with his retinue and begged his father to 
return to the kingdom. He refused to do so, and, at his own suggestion, a city 
was built for him in the forest which was called Koliya or Vyagghapajja. Rāma 
thus became the ancestor of the Koliyans. DA.i.260ff.; SNA.355f.; cf. Mtu.i.355, 
where he is called Kola.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Rāma. </b>A brahmin, father of the Buddha’s teacher, Uddaka Rāmaputta 
(q.v.). J.i.66; M.i.165.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Rāma. </b>The Bodhisatta born as the eldest son of Dasaratha, king of 
Benares. He is also called Rāmapandita. He married his sister Sītā, and her 
devotion to him became proverbial (E.g., J.iv.559, 560; Cv.lxxiii.137). For 
Rāma’s story see the Dasaratha Jātaka. Certain ruling princes of Ceylon claimed 
descent from Rāma&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., Jagatipāla (q.v.). Rāma’s fight with Rāvana 
and the incidents recounted in the Rāmāyana are mentioned only in the later Pāli 
Chronicles, such as the Cūlavamsa. Cv.lxiv.42; lxviii.20; lxxv.59; lxxxiii.46, 
69, 88.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Rāma. </b>A Sākyan prince, brother of Bhaddakaccānā. He came to Ceylon, 
where he founded the settlement of Rāmagona. Mhv.ix.9; Dpv.x.4ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Rāma.</b> Called Mātuposaka Rāma. He was an Inhabitant of Benares and 
greatly loved his parents. He once went on business to Kumbhavatī, in the 
country of Dandakī, and there, when the country was being destroyed owing to the 
wickedness of the king, Rāma thought of the goodness of his parents. The devas 
were moved by the power of this thought and conveyed him safely to his mother 
(J.v.29). He was one of the three survivors of the disaster which overtook 
Dandakī’s kingdom. MA.ii.602.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Rāma.</b> One of the palaces of Kondañña Buddha in his last lay life. 
BuA.107; but see Bu.iii.26.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Rāma.</b> One of the generals of Gajabāhu. Rāma was once defeated by 
the general Deva (Cv.lxx.137, 142), but later won a victory at the Mahārakkha 
ford. Rāma received the title of Nīlagiri, which was evidently the name of his 
district. Cv.lxxii.12; Cv. Trs.i.299, n.1; 320, n.2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Rāma. </b>The second of the future Buddhas. Anāgatavamsa, p. 40.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Rāma. </b>See <a href="ramma.htm" title="r/ramma.htm">Ramma</a>.</p>
