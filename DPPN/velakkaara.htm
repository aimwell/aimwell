<p>A troop of mercenary soldiers employed by the medieval 
kings of Ceylon. </p>
<p>They revolted against Vijayabāhu I., pillaged Pulatthipura, 
burnt down the palace, and took captive the king’s sister Mittā. Vijayabāhu had 
to flee to Vātagiri, but later he quelled the rebellion and had the ringleaders 
tortured to death (Cv.lx.36ff). </p>
<p>They revolted against Gajabāhu (Cv.lxiii.24, 29) and later 
against Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxxiv.44; for details see Cv.Trs.i.217, n.5). In 
both cases the rebellion was crushed and the leaders punished.</p>
