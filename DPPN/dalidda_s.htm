<p>1. Dalidda Sutta.-Preached at the 
Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha. A poor man of Rājagaha, following the teaching of 
the Buddha, was reborn in Tāvatimsa, outshining the other gods in beauty and 
glory. This vexed them, but Sakka appealed to them saying that he who had 
learning, charity and wisdom, in accordance with the Buddha’s teachings, was 
certain to obtain great bliss. S.i.231f.</p>
<p>2. Dalidda Sutta.-The term “poor wretch” 
(dalidda) is rightly applicable to him who does not develop the seven 
bojjhangas. S.v.100.</p>
