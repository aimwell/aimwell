<p>An eminent prince of Ceylon in the time 
of Vikkamabāhu IV. He was of the Giri family and lived in Peraddonī (modern 
Perādeniya). The Cūlavamsa does not recount much of him, save that he was full 
of virtue and piety and that he did many good deeds, such as the advancement of 
the Order; also that he was the founder of Jayavaddhanakotta, which soon after 
became the capital of Ceylon (Cv.xci.3-9). The Sinhalese chronicles, however 
(See Cv.Trs.ii.212, n.4), tell us a good deal about him, the most important fact 
being that he succeeded in breaking the power of the Jaffna king which was then 
at its height. Formerly it was believed that Alagakkonāra later became king 
under the name of Bhuvanekabāhu V., but now that opinion has been given up.
