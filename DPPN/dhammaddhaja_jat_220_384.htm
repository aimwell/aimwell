<p><b>1. Dhammaddhaja Jātaka (No.220).</b>-The 
Bodhisatta was once born as Dhammaddhaja, chaplain to Yasapāni, king of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. 
One day the king’s captain, Kālaka, who was wont to take bribes, gave a wrong 
decision in a case, and the Bodhisatta, being appealed to, reheard the case and 
decided in the plaintiff’s favour. The people applauded greatly and the king 
made him judge. But Kālaka, wishing for an excuse to put Dhammaddhaja to death, 
persuaded the king that he was getting too popular, and the king gave him 
various impossible tasks. Dhammaddhaja, with the help of Sakka, performed them 
all. One day the king ordered him to find a park-keeper with four virtues, and 
once again, with the aid of Sakka, the Bodhisatta discovered Chattapāni, the 
king’s barber. On being questioned, Chattapāni told the king that he was free 
from envy, drank no wine, had no strong desires, never gave way to anger; he 
then related stories of his past lives, the experiences of which had made him 
renounce these evils. (For details see Chattapāni 2). The king, at length, 
discovered Kālaka’s perfidy and had him put to death.</p>
<p>The Jātaka was related in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with Kālaka and 
Sāriputta with Chattapāni. J.ii.186-96.</p>

<p><b>2. Dhammaddhaja Jātaka (No.384).-</b>The 
Bodhisatta was once born as leader of a flock of birds on an island. Certain 
merchants of Benares started on a voyage taking with them, to aid them on the 
way, a much travelled crow. The ship was wrecked and the crow flew to the 
island. There he pretended to the other birds that he was a holy person, 
practising austerities and living on air. The birds, being deceived by him, left 
him in charge of their eggs and young ones, which he proceeded to eat each day. 
One day the Bodhisatta kept watch and thus discovered his villainy. The birds 
collected round the crow and pecked him to death.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
deceitful monk, who is identified with the crow. J.iii.267-70.</p>
