<p><b>1. Somadatta Jātaka (No. 211). </b>The story of the 
Bodhisatta when he was born as the son of Aggidatta. For details see Aggidatta 
(J.ii.164-7). The story was related in reference to Lāludāyi who is identified 
with Aggidatta, and is repeated in the Dhammapada Commentary. DhA.iii.123ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Somadatta Jātaka (No. 410).</b> A wealthy brahmin of 
Benares once left the world and became an ascetic in the Himalaya, where he 
adopted an elephant calf, calling it Somadatta. One day the elephant ate too 
much and fell ill. The brahmin went in search of wild fruit for it, but before 
he could return, the animal was dead. The ascetic was filled with grief. Sakka 
(the Bodhisatta) saw this and, appearing before him, reminded him that it was 
not for this that he had left wife, wealth and children.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who had 
ordained a novice, and, when the latter died, he was full of grief. Somadatta is 
identified with the novice and the brahmin with the monk. J.iii.388-91.</p>
