<p><b>1. Sela. </b>A king of long ago who, in spite of great 
sacrifices, could not get beyond the world of the Petas (Pitrs). J.vi.99.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sela.</b> A brahmin of Anguttarāpa. He was a great 
friend of Keniya, the Jatila, and visited him when Keniya was making 
preparations to entertain the Buddha. Having heard the word “Buddha” from 
Keniya, Sela was filled with joy and fortitude, and went with his two hundred 
and fifty pupils to visit the Buddha in the woodland near Apana. There he 
observed on the person of the Buddha the thirty two marks of a Great Being all 
except two — viz., hidden privates and the long tongue. The Buddha read his 
thoughts and contrived, by his iddhi power, that Sela should be satisfied on 
these two points as well (This is referred to at Mil.167; DA.i.276, etc.). Sela 
then praised the Buddha in a series of verses and asked questions of him. At the 
end of his talk, Sela entered the Order with his pupils, and, at the end of a 
week, he attained arahantship (SN. p.104 ff. = M.ii.146f).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sela had been the leader 
of the same guild of three hundred men, and, together with them, had built a 
parivena for the Buddha and done many good acts. As a result of these they 
received the “ehi Bhikkhu-pabbajjā” in this last life (SNA.ii.455; MA.ii.782; 
see also Ap.i.316; Thag.vs.818-41; Th4gA.ii.47f).</p>
<p>Mahāsela, mentioned as the teacher of Sugandha Thera 
(ThagA.i.80f), is probably identical with this Sela. Sela lived to the age of 
one hundred and twenty (DA.ii.413).</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.384; also 
AA.i.219), the Buddha first met Sela on his way to Bhaddiya to convert Visākhā 
and her kinswomen. Visākhā was then seven years old. The Apadāna says (Ap.i.318) 
that Sela’s father was a wealthy brahmin, named Vāsettha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sela.</b> A mountain in Himavā. ApA.i.96.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sela.</b> Son of Atthadassī Buddha in his last lay 
life. BuA.180; but see Sena (15).</p>
