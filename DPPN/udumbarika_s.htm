<p>Preached at the 
Udumbarikā-paribbājakārāma.  </p>
<p><a href="sandhana.htm" title="sa/sandhana.htm">Sandhāna</a>, on his way to see the Buddha, stopped at 
the paribbājakārāma because it was yet too early for his interview, and started 
talking to the <a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājaka</a>
<a href="nigrodha.htm" title="n/nigrodha.htm">Nigrodha</a>. Nigrodha spoke disparagingly of the 
Buddha’s love of solitude. Seeing the Buddha walking along the banks of the 
Sumāgadhā, Nigrodha invited him to his hermitage and asked him various 
questions. The Buddha turned the discussion on to the merits and demerits of 
self-mortification and ended up by declaring the purpose of his own teaching. 
 
</p>
<p>Though Nigrodha expresses great admiration for the Buddha’s exposition, he and 
his disciples do not become followers of the Buddha (D.iii.36ff). 
<a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> 
says (DA.iii.844), however, that this sutta will stand them in good stead in the 
future.</p>
