  <h2>Thapatayo Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The royal chamberlains, Isidatta and 
Purina, staying at Sādhuka, hear that the Buddha is in the village and, waiting 
for him, follow him till he sits down under a tree. They tell him of their joy 
that he is staying near them. They are proud in telling him that in spite of the 
temptations placed in their way in the performance of their duties, they are 
free from thoughts of lust. The Buddha tells them they are possessed of the four 
qualities of Sotāpannas and should, therefore, be thankful for their good 
fortune. S.v.348ff.</p>
