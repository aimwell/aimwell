<p>1. Dhammadassī.-The fifteenth of the 
twenty-four Buddhas. He was born in the Sarana pleasance in the city of Sarana, 
his father being a khattiya named Sarana, and his mother Sunandā. It is said 
that on the day of his birth all unjust laws disappeared from the law-books, 
hence his name. For eight thousand years he lived in the household, in three 
palaces — Araja, Viraja and Sudassana. His chief wife was Vicitolī and his son 
Puññavaddhana. He left the world travelling in his palace, accompanied by all 
his retinue. For seven days he practised austerities; his wife gave him a meal 
of milk-rice, and a yavapālaka, named Sirivaddha, gave grass for his seat; his 
bodhi-tree was a bimbijāla-tree. His first sermon was preached at Isipatana. 
Later he preached to King Sañjaya of Tagara, and to Sakka, who was the 
Bodhisatta. The Buddha’s half-brothers, Paduma and Phussadeva, became his chief 
disciples, and Hārita was chief of those who practised the dhutangas. The 
Buddha’s personal attendant was Sunetta, his chief women disciples being Khemā 
and Sabba-(Sacca)-dinnā. Subhadda and Katisaha were the chief among men of his 
lay patrons, and Sāliyā and Valiyā among women. The Buddha’s body was eighty 
cubits high and he lived to be one hundred thousand years old, dying at the 
Kesārāma in Sālavati. Bu.xvi.1ff; BuA.182ff; J.i.38, 39, 40, 44.</p>
