<p>1. Indriya Sutta.-The monk possessed of 
six qualities — the five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), and the freedom of mind 
brought about by the destruction of the āsavas — is worthy of offerings, etc. 
A.iii.281.</p>
<p>2. Indriya Sutta.-Where control of the 
faculties of sense (indriya) is not found, morality ceases to exist and, in 
consequence, concentration, insight into and knowledge of reality as it is, 
detachment and the feeling of revulsion, insight into liberation — these also 
cease to exist. When such control is present all the other qualities are also 
present. A.iii.360.</p>
<p>3. Indriya Sutta.-If a monk, observing 
the rise and fall in the faculties of sense, is repelled by them and lusts not 
for them, the knowledge arises in him that he is free and that for him there is 
no hereafter. Thus would he be perfect in faculty. S.iv.140.</p>
<p>4. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhā, 
etc.), are called the Path that goes to the Uncompounded (asankhata). S.iv.361.</p>
<p>5. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhā, 
etc.), when practised with singleness of heart, dispassion, and cessation that 
conduces to abandonment, form the Path leading to the Uncompounded. S.iv.365.</p>
<p>6. Indriya Sutta.-Anuruddha tells his 
colleagues that by cultivating the four satipatthānas, he knows, as they really 
are, the nature of the minds of other beings, of other persons (indriyaparopariyatti). 
S.v.305.</p>
