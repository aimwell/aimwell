<p>The story of a woman who, finding that 
her husband had relations with a female servant, bound the servant hand and 
foot, cut off her nose and locked her up in a secret chamber. In order to hide 
the deed from her husband, she took him to the monastery to hear the Buddha 
preach. Some relatives of hers came to the house and discovering what had 
happened, released the servant. She went to the monastery where her mistress was 
listening to the Buddha’s sermon and proclaimed aloud the wrong done to her. The 
Buddha, thereupon, pointed out the folly of doing evil in the hope that it would 
not be found out. We are told that both the woman and her husband became 
Sotāpanna at the end of the sermon. The servant was set free (DhA.iii.486-7).</p>
