<p>1. Ākāsagangā.-The river that flows 
southward from the Anotatta Lake receives, in its different stages, various 
names. That part of it which flows sixty leagues through the air is called 
Ākāsagangā (SnA.ii.439; MA.586, etc.). The Buddha’s discourse on various topics 
(pakinnakakathā) is like the downward flow of the Ākāsagangā (AA.i.94; 
DhA.iii.360); so also is the eloquence of clever preachers (E.g., DhA.iv.18; 
J.ii.65).</p>
<p>The fine clay to be found in the area 
(thirty yojanas in extent) over which the Ākāsagangā falls to earth, is called, 
on account of its fineness, “butter clay” (navanīta-mattikā). This clay was 
brought by arahant sāmaneras to be spread over the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa 
in Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxix.5f). The spot where it is found is called 
Tintasīsakola. MT.515</p>
<p>2. Ākāsagangā.-A vast channel built by 
Parakkamabāhu I. to bring water from the Kāragangā to the Parakkamammudda. 
Cv.lxxix.25.</p>
