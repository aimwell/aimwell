  <h2>Cūla Gosinga Sutta</h2>

<p>The Buddha, residing at the 
Giñjakāvasatha in Nādikā, visits the Gosinga-Sālavana, where dwell Anuruddha, 
Nandiya and Kimbila. (According to the Vinaya account (i.350), this incident 
takes place in Pācīnavamsadāya). At first the keeper tries to stop the Buddha 
from approaching them, fearing lest he should disturb their meditation. The 
Buddha questions them as to their attainments and praises them. At the end of 
the sutta mention is made of a Yakkha, named Dīgha, visiting the Buddha and 
telling him how the fame of the three Elders had travelled even to the world of 
Brahmā (M.i.205-11). The sutta illustrates the greatness of harmony (sāmaggi).
