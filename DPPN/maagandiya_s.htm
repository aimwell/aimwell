<p><b>1. Māgandiya Sutta. </b>The conversation between 
Māgandiya and the Buddha after the former had offered the Buddha his daughter in 
marriage. Māgandiya expresses the view that purity comes from philosophy, from 
disputations and discussions, learning and. austerities. The Buddha denies this, 
and says that purity comes from inward peace. The sage (muni) is a confessor of 
peace and does not indulge in disputes. SN. vs. 835 47.</p>
<p><b>2. Māgandiya Sutta.</b> Records the conversation 
between the Buddha and the paribbājaka Māgandiya. Māgandiya says the Buddha is a 
repressionist (bhunahu) and this the Buddha denies, saying that he teaches only 
the subjugation of the senses, knowing their origin and their cessation; he has 
discarded all craving after them and dwells with his heart at peace. He then 
relates how, in his youth, he had enjoyed the greatest and most luxurious kinds 
of sensuous pleasures and had renounced them. He could no more crave for them 
than a leper, cured of his disease, craves for his old sores. Both the Buddha 
and teachers of other persuasions are convinced that health is the greatest boon 
and Nibbāna the highest bliss. But the Buddha’s conception of health and Nibbāna 
differs from that of other teachers. Their knowledge is as that of a blind man, 
taken on trust. Māgandiya listens and is convinced. He enters the Order and 
becomes an arahant. M.i.501 13; Thomas: op. cit., 115.</p>
