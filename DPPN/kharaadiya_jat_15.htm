<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a leader 
of deer. His sister Kharādiyā brought him her son that he might teach him the 
wisdom of the deer, but the young deer was disobedient and did not attend his 
lessons. As a result, he was caught in a gin and killed by huntsmen.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an 
unruly monk. Kharādiyā is identified with Uppalavannā. J.i.159f.</p>
