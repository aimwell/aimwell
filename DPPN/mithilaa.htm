<p>The capital of the <a href="videha.htm" title="vy/videha.htm">Videha</a> country.  </p>
<p>The city was very 
ancient, and, according to the <a href="mahagovinda_s.htm" title="maha/mahagovinda_s.htm">Mahāgovinda Sutta</a> (D.ii.235), was founded by Mahāgovinda, steward of King 
<a href="renu.htm" title="r/renu.htm">Renu</a>.  </p>
<p>It was also the capital of <a href="makhadeva.htm" title="ma/makhadeva.htm">Makhādeva</a> 
(M.ii.72f; MT.129; see also Dpv.iii.9, 29, 35) and eighty four thousand of his 
descendants, and of various other kings mentioned in the Jātakas&nbsp;-&nbsp;

</ul>
<p>The size of the city is frequently given (E.g., J.iii.365) as seven leagues in 
circumference, and the <a href="mahajanaka_jat_539.htm" title="maha/mahajanaka_jat_539.htm">Mahājanaka Jātaka</a> (J.vi.46f) contains a description of 
it. There was a road leading from <a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a> to Mithilā, a distance of sixty leagues 
(J.vi.32).</p>
<p>According to the 
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahāummagga Jātaka</a> (J.vi.330f) there were 
four market towns at the four gates of Mithilā, each being known by the name of 
Yavamajjhaka.  </p>
<p>The Buddha is mentioned as having stayed in Mithilā and having 
preached there the <a href="makhadeva.htm" title="ma/makhadeva.htm">Makhādeva Sutta</a> (M.ii.74) and the
<a href="brahmayu_s.htm">Brahmāyu Sutta</a> (M.ii.133). </p>
<p>It was also in Mithilā that the 
<a href="vaasetthii.htm">Therī Vāsetthī</a> (Thig. vs. 135; see also Dvy., p. 
60) first met the Buddha and entered the Order, after having heard him preach. 
 
</p>
<p>After the Buddha’s death, the Videhas of Mithilā claimed a part of his relics 
and obtained them (Bu.xxviii.11).  </p>
<p>In the time of Konāgamana Buddha Mithilā was 
the capital of King Pabbata, and the Buddha preached there on his visit to the 
city (BuA. 215). Padumuttara Buddha preached his first sermon to his cousins, 
Devala and Sujāta, in the park of Mithilā, (Bu.xi.23; BuA.159) and later to King 
Ānanda and his retinue in the same spot (BuA.160).</p>
<p>Mithilā is generally identified with Janakapura, a small 
town within the Nepal border, north of which the Mazaffarpur and Darbhanga 
districts meet (CAGI., p. 718).</p>
<p>In the Indian Epics (E.g., Ramayana i. 48) Mithilā, is 
chiefly famous as the residence of King Janaka.</p>
