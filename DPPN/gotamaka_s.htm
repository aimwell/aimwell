<p>Preached to the monks at the 
Gotamakacetiya. The Buddha declares that his proclamation of a Dhamma is with 
full comprehension, with casual connection (sanidānam), and accompanied by 
wonders. His instructions are with reason (A.i.276f).</p>
<p>It is said that at this pronouncement 
the thousand fold universe trembled (Also DA.i.130; J.ii.259). 
The Majjhima Commentary (i.49) states that the Sutta 
was preached to the monks mentioned in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and that, at the 
end, they became arahants.</p>
