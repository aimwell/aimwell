<p>Once Brahmadatta, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, travelled about his 
kingdom in disguise seeking for some one who would tell him of a fault possessed 
by him. One day, in a frontier village, a very rich landowner saw him, and, 
pleased with his appearance, brought him a very luxurious meal. The king took 
the food and passed it to his chaplain; the latter gave it to an ascetic who 
happened to be by. The ascetic placed it in the bowl of a Pacceka Buddha sitting 
near them. The Pacceka Buddha proceeded, without a word, to eat the meal. The 
landowner was astonished and asked them the reason for their action, and, on 
learning that each one was progressively greater in virtue than the king, he 
rejoiced greatly.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a landowner of 
Sāvatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha. Being anxious to honour the Dhamma 
also, he consulted the Buddha, and, acting on his advice, invited Ānanda to his 
house and gave him choice food and three costly robes. Ānanda took them and 
offered them to Sāriputta, who, in his turn, made a gift of them to the Buddha.</p>
<p>Ānanda was the king of the story, Sāriputta the chaplain, 
while the ascetic was the Bodhisatta. J.iv.369ff.</p>
