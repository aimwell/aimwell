<p>1. Atula.-An upāsaka of Sāvatthi. He 
went with five hundred others to listen to Revata, who, however, being fond of 
solitude, would not preach to him. In anger he went to Sāriputta who, on hearing 
his grievances, discoursed at length on the Abhidhamma. Annoyed thereat he 
repaired to Ānanda, to whom he told the story. Ānanda preached them a very short 
sermon, and the upāsakas in despair sought the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out to 
them that they had been too hasty in their condemnation. At the end of the 
discourse Atula and his companions gained the First Fruit of the Path.
