  <h2>Janasandha Jātaka (No.468)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as 
Janasandha, son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He studied at Takkasilā. On 
becoming king he built six almonries and there daily distributed six thousand 
pieces of money. He ruled righteously and his kingdom was free from all 
wickedness. On the fifteenth day of every month he assembled all his people, 
beginning with the women of his household, and preached to them the ways of 
righteousness.</p>
<p>The story was related to Pasenadi when 
he gave himself up to sin, became remiss in his duties and refrained from 
visiting even the Buddha for a long time. J.iv.176ff.</p>
