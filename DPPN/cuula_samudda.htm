<p>An Elder of Ceylon (Tambapanni). Once, 
in a time of famine, seven hundred monks came to him early in the day. Realising 
that he could not get alms anywhere in Ceylon, he took them across to 
Pātaliputta by the power of his iddhi. Before he started the monks asked him the 
time, and when he told them they said, “But, Sir, Pātaliputta is far off!” 
“Friends, aged elders seize the distance and make it near.” “Where is the ocean, 
Sir?” “Friends, that was the dark ditch you passed on the way!” “But, Sir, the 
ocean is large!” “Friends, aged elders make the great small.” (Vsm.403). The 
Majjhima Commentary (ii.758) mentions a Gavilangana-vāsi Cūlasammuda who, when 
asked what he wished for, answered, “Lokuttara things only.”</p>
