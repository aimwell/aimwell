<p>The chief groom of the elephant house of the king of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Bandhura had only one eye. </p>
<p>A crow built her nest over the doorway of the elephant 
house, laid there her eggs and hatched out her young. But every time Bandhura 
entered or left the stable on the back of the elephant, he struck the crow’s 
nest with his hook, thus destroying it. The crow, in despair, made complaint, 
and her cry was one of the sounds mentioned in the <b>Atthasadda Jātaka</b>. 
When the king discovered how Bandhura was acting, he rebuked him and dismissed 
him from his service. J.iii.430 f.</p>
