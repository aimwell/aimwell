  <h2>Asadisa Jātaka (No. 181)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of the prince Asadisa. It was 
told in reference to the Great Renunciation to show that in former lives also 
the Bodhisatta had renounced a royal state (J.ii.86-92). The latter part of the 
story is given in the Mahāvastu and is called the Saraksepana Jātaka 
(Mtu.ii.82-3).</p>
<p>The story is figured in the Bharhut 
Stupa (Cunningham, p.70, and Plate xxvii.13) and in the Sanchi Tope (Fergusson, 
Tree and Serpent Worship, p.181, Plate xxxvi). King Kittisiri of Ceylon wrote a 
beautiful poem in Sinhalese based on this Jātaka. Cv. Supplement 101, vs.13.</p>
