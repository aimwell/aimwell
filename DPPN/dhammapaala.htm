<p><b>1. Dhammapāla Thera.</b>-An arahant. He was 
a brahmin of Avanti and studied in Takkasilā. While returning from there after 
completing his studies, he saw a monk dwelling apart and, having heard the 
Dhamma from him, entered the Order and became an arahant. We are told that one 
day, while meditating, he saw two novices climbing a tree in the vihāra to pick 
flowers. The bough broke and they fell, but he, with his iddhi-power, caught 
them and put them down unhurt.</p>
<p>In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he gave 
to the Buddha a pilakkha-fruit (Thag.vs.203f; ThagA.i.326f). He is probably 
identical with Pilakkhaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.298.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dhammapāla.</b>-A brahmin, son of the 
Bodhisatta. See Mahā-Dhammapāla.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Dhammapāla.</b>-The Bodhisatta born as 
the son of Mahā-Dhammapāla. For his story see the Mahā-Dhammapāla Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Dhammapāla</b>.-The Bodhisatta born as 
the son of King Mahāpatāpa. For his story see the Culla-Dhammapāla Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Dhammapāla.</b>-A name given to Vidhurapandita. J.vi.289, 291.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Dhammapāla Kumāra.</b>-The son of Vidhurapandita (q.v.). He is identified with Rāhula. J.vi.290, 300, 329.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Dhammapāla.</b>-The name of the family (kula) 
of Dhammapāla, and the village in Kāsi where he lived (J.iv.50; PvA.61). See the 
Mahā-Dhammapāla Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Dhammapāla.</b>-A celebrated author, 
generally referred to as Ācariya. Various works are attributed to him, but as 
there seem to have been several authors of the same name (Gv. (p.66f.) mentions 
four), it is difficult to assign their works separately. The best known, 
distinguished by the name of Ācariya, is said (Gv. p.69) to have written 
fourteen books. The Sāsanavamsa (p.33) records that he lived at Badaratittha in 
South India. </p>
<p>His works show that he was a native of 
Kāñcipura. His period is uncertain, though it is generally agreed that he is 
posterior to Buddhaghosa. He seems to have studied in the Mahāvihāra, because he 
mentions this fact in the introduction to his books (e.g., the Petavatthu 
Commentary). It is quite likely that he studied the Tamil Commentaries as well 
and that he wrote at Badaratittha. (Hiouen Thsang, Beal.ii.229, says that 
Dhammapāla was a clever youth of Kāñcipura and that the king gave him his 
daughter. But Dhammapāla, not wishing to marry, prayed before an image of the 
Buddha. The gods took him to a place far away where he was ordained by the 
monks). </p>
<p>The Khuddaka Nikāya was his chief study, 
and seven of his works are commentaries on the books of poetry preserved in the 
Canon — the Thera- and Theri-Gāthā, Udāna, Vimāna- and Peta-Vatthu, Itivuttaka 
and Cariyāpitaka. His other works are a commentary on the Netti, and on the 
Visuddhi-magga (called the Paramatthamañjūsā), tīkās (called Līnatthavannanā) on 
Buddhaghosa’s Commentaries to the Four Nikāyas and another on the 
Jātakatthakathā. He is also credited with having written a tīkā on the 
Buddhavamsa Commentary and on the Abhidhammatthakathā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Dhammapāla.</b>-A thera of Ceylon, 
generally called Culla-Dhammapāla. He was the senior pupil of Vanaratana Ānanda 
and wrote the Saccasankhepa. He is also credited with tīkās on several works, 
including a Līnathavannanā on Ānanda’s Mūlatikā. Gv.60, 70; also P.L.C., 203f, 
211.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Dhammapāla.</b>-A Burmese scholar of Arimaddana. Gv.67.</p>
