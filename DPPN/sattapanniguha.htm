</ul>
<p>A cave in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, on the slope of Mount Vebhāra. Once, 
when the Buddha was staying there, he gave to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> the opportunity of asking 
him to live for an eon, but Ānanda, because of his un-mindfulness, failed to 
take it (D.ii.116).  </p>
<p>The cave was sometimes used as a residence for monks coming 
from afar (E.g., Vin.ii.76; iii.159).  </p>
<p>According to the Commentaries and the 
Chronicle the First Council was held in a hall erected by 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> outside the Sattapanniguhā. S.i.9; Sp.i.10; Mhv.iii.19; Dpv.iv.14; v.5; ThagA.i.351; the 
cave is not mentioned in the Vinaya account of the Council, in the eleventh 
chapter of the Culla Vagga.</p>
