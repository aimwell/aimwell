<p>Moggallāna visits Tāvatimsa and, seeing 
thirty-six goddesses whose palaces were next to each other, questions them as to 
their acts in the past, and reports their answers to the Buddha. The Buddha 
replies that those same goddesses were in Tāvatimsa at the time of Guttila’s 
visit; he then proceeds to give an account of Guttila. Vv.iii.5; VvA.137ff</p>
