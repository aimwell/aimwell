<p>1. Adhimutta.-A Brahmin of Sāvatthi. 
Dissatisfied with Brahmin learning, he looked for salvation elsewhere, and 
hearing the Buddha preach at the presentation of Jetavana, entered the Order, 
becoming an arahant in due course (ThagA.i.224). A verse addressed by him to 
some corpulent monks is found in the Theragāthā (v.114).</p>
<p>In Padumuttara’s time he was a learned 
Brahmin and became an ascetic. Later he met the Buddha, offered him a bark-robe 
and uttered his praises in song. He is probably identical with Sabbakittika of 
the Apadāna (i.323-4).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Adhimutta.-See Atimuttaka (2).</p>
<hr>
<p>Adhimutti Sutta.-Preached to Ānanda on 
the ten powers of a Tathāgata. A.v.36f.</p>
