<p>Once an elephant, caught in the Himālaya, 
while being trained by the king’s trainers, broke away from his chains and 
escaped to the mountains. There he lived in a constant state of terror until the 
Bodhisatta, who was a tree-sprite, dispelled his fears.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who was always in fear of death. He is identified with the elephant. 
J.i.414-6.</p>
