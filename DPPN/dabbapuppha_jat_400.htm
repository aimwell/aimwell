<p>There was once a jackal called Māyāvī. 
His wife had a longing to eat fresh fish, and while he was searching for it he 
saw two otters, Anutīracārī and Gambhīracārī, disputing as to the division of a 
rohita fish which they had caught between them. They appealed to Māyāvī to 
arbitrate, and he gave one the head, the other the tail, while he kept the 
middle portion for himself!</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Upananda, who is identified with the jackal. Two old monks had received as a 
gift two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket, and they appealed to him to divide 
the gifts. He gave them each a cloak and kept the blanket for himself. 
J.iii.332ff; the story is quoted at DhA.iii.139ff.</p>
