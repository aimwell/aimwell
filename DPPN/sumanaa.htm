<p><b>1. Sumanā.</b> An aggasāvikā of Anomadassī Buddha. 
J.i.36; Bu.viii.23.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sumanā. </b>Wife of Sirivaddhaka and mother of 
Mahosadha. J.vi.331.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sumanā.</b> A Nāga maiden, wife of the Nāga king 
Campeyya. See the Campeyya Jātaka. She is identified with Rāhulamātā. J.iv.468.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sumanā.</b> Wife of Sumana (14) and mother of 
Nigrodha-sāmanera. Mhv.v.41.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sumanā.</b> Wife of Sumedha Buddha in his last lay 
life. Bu.xii.20.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sumanā.</b> Called Sumanārājakumārī. She was the 
daughter of the king of Kosala and sister of Pasenadi. She is included among the 
eminent upāsikās (A.iv.347). She once visited the Buddha, with five hundred 
royal maidens in five hundred royal chariots, and questioned him regarding the 
efficacy of giving (See Sumanārājakumārī Sutta, A.iii.32f).</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (AA.ii.593f ) that these five 
hundred companions were born on the same day as herself. She was seven years old 
when the Buddha paid his first visit to Sāvatthi, and she was present at the 
dedication of Jetavana with her five hundred companions, carrying vases, 
flowers, etc., as offering to the Buddha. After the Buddha’s sermon she became a 
sotāpanna.</p>
<p>It is said that, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, she 
belonged to a setthi family, her father being dead. When the people, almost at 
the point of the sword, obtained the king’s permission to entertain the Buddha 
and his monks, it was the senāpati’s privilege to invite the Buddha to his house 
on the first day. When Sumanā came back from playing, she found her mother in 
tears, and when asked the reason, her mother replied, “If your father had been 
alive, ours would have been the privilege of entertaining the Buddha today.” 
Sumanā comforted her by saying that that honour should yet be theirs. She filled 
a golden bowl with richly flavoured milk rice, covering it with another bowl. 
She then wrapped both vessels all round with jasmine flowers and left the house 
with her slaves. On the way to the senāpati’s house she was stopped by his men, 
but she coaxed them to let her pass, and, as the Buddha approached, saying that 
she wished to offer him a jasmine garland, she put the two vessels into his alms 
bowl. She then made the resolve that in every subsequent birth she should be 
named Sumanā and that her body should be like a garland of jasmine. When the 
Buddha arrived in the senāpati’s house and was served first with soup, he 
covered his bowl saying that he had already been given his food. At the end of 
the meal the senāpati made enquiries, and, full of admiration for Sumanā’s 
courage, invited her to his house and made her his chief consort. Ever after 
that she was known as Sumanā, and, wherever she was born, a shower of jasmine 
flowers fell knee deep on the day of her birth.</p>
<p>According to the Therīgāthā Commentary (ThigA.22f), Sumanā 
joined the Order in her old age. She was present when the Buddha preached to 
Pasenadi, the discourse (S.i.68-70) beginning with, “There are four young 
creatures, Sire, who may not be disregarded,” and Pasenadi was established in 
the Refuges and the Precepts. Sumanā wished to leave the world, but put off 
doing so that she might look after her grandmother as long as she lived.</p>
<p>After the grandmother’s death, Sumanā went with Pasenadi 
to the vihāra, taking such things as rugs and carpets, which she presented to 
the Order. The Buddha preached to her and to Pasenadi, and she became an 
anāgāmī. She then sought ordination, and, at the conclusion of the stanzas 
(Thig.vs.16) preached to her by the Buddha, attained arahantship.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sumanā Therī. </b>She was a Sākyan maiden, belonging 
to the harem of the Bodhisatta before his renunciation. She joined the Order 
under Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī, and, as she sat meditating, the Buddha appeared 
before her in a ray of glory. She developed insight and became an arahant.

near Anurādhapura. The king, hearing of her, made her his chief queen.
