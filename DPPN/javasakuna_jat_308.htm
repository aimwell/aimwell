<p>The Bodhisatta was once a woodpecker, 
and coming across a lion with a bone stuck in his throat he removed the bone, 
after having fixed a stick in the lion’s mouth to prevent him from biting off 
the head of his rescuer. Later, he saw the lion eating the carcase of a buffalo 
and asked for a boon. The lion refused, saying it was enough for him to have 
escaped death after putting his head into a lion’s jaws. The lion is identified 
with Devadatta, and the story was related in reference to his ingratitude.
