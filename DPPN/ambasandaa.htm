<p>A brahmin village in <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> to the east 
of <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>.  </p>
<p>To the north of the village was the <a href="vediya.htm" title="vy/vediya.htm">Vediyaka</a> mountain, in which was 
the <a href="indasaalaguhaa.htm" title="i_/indasaalaguhaa.htm">Indasālaguhā</a>, where the 
<a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a> was preached. On the occasion of 
the preaching, as <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> with his retinue came to visit the Buddha, the village 
was bathed in radiance (D.ii.263f).</p>

village lay in the vicinity of many mango groves. DA.iii.697.</p>
