<p>A Lambakanna, king of Ceylon (307-9 A.C.), generally 
called Sirisanghabodhi. He succeeded Sanghatissa and set up a salākā house in 
the Mahāvihāra. He was a very good king, and made rain fall by virtue of his 
goodness. He quelled the Yakkha Rattakkhi, who devastated his territory. When 
his treasurer, Gothakābhaya, rose in revolt, he abdicated in his favour and 
became an ascetic. Later, he gave his head in gratitude to a poor man who gave 
him a meal, so that the man could win from the king the price which had been set 
on his head. (Mhv.xxxvi.73ff.; Dpv.xxii.53f ).</p>
<p>The legend of the king surrendering his head is famous in 
Ceylon, and forms the theme of a Pāli Chronicle, the Hatthavanagallavihāravamsa.</p>
