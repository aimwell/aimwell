<p>A yakkha, friend of Suciloma. He was 
passing through Gayā with Suciloma when the latter questioned the Buddha on his 
doctrine, as recorded in the Suciloma Sutta (S.i.207f.; SN., p.47f.; SNA.i.302). 
Khara had been a monk in a previous birth, and had once rubbed on his body oil 
belonging to the Sangha without asking the permission of the monks. As a result 
his body was ugly, and his skin coarse and rough and like a “tiled roof.” 
Whenever he wished to frighten anybody his skin would stand up like tiles on a 
roof. At the end of the recitation of the Suciloma Sutta, Khara became a 
sotāpanna, and his skin became beautiful and golden-hued. Ibid., 305.</p>
