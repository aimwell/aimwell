  <h2>Madda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name of a country and its people (Maddā). In the Kusa 
Jātaka (q.v.), Kusa, son of Okkāka, king of Kusāvatī in the Malla country, is 
mentioned as having married Pabhāvatī, daughter of the king of Madda, and the 
capital of the Madda king was Sāgala (J.v.283ff.; Kusāvati was one hundred 
leagues from Sāgala (J.v.290), cp. Mtu.ii.441f). </p>
<p>In the similar story of Anitthigandha, a prince of Benares 
contracts a marriage with a daughter of the king of Sāgala&nbsp;&nbsp; his name 
being Maddava; but the girl dies on the way to her husband. (SNA.i.68f.; cp. 
DhA.iii.281, about the other Anitthigandha of Sāvatthi of the Buddha’s days, who 
also married a Madda princess). </p>
<p>The Chaddanta Jātaka also mentions a matrimonial alliance 
between the royal houses of Benares and Sāgala, while in the Kālingabodhi Jātaka 
(J.iv.230f ) the Madda king’s daughter marries a prince of Kālinga while both 
are in exile. </p>
<p>J.v.39f.; so also in the Mūgapakkha Jātaka (J.vi.1), the 
wife of the Kāsi king was the daughter of the king of Madda, Candadevi by name; 
while Phusatī, wife of Sañjaya of Jetuttara in the Sivi kingdom and mother of 
Vessantara, was also a Madda princess (J.vi.480); likewise Maddī, wife of 
Vessantara.</p>
<p>Cūlani, son of Talatā, also married a princess of Madda 
(J.vi.471). According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.viii.7; this probably refers to 
Madras and not to the Madda country, whose capital was Sāgala), Sumitta, son of 
Sīhabāhu and king of Sīhapura, married the daughter of the Madda king and had 
three sons by him, the youngest of whom, Panduvāsudeva, became king of Ceylon.</p>
<p>Bhaddā Kāpilānī wife of Pippalimānava (Mahā Kassapa), was 
the daughter of a Kosiyagotta brahmin of Sāgala in the Madda country. Men went 
there in search of a wife for him because it was famed for the beauty of its 
women (Maddarattham nāma itthāgāro) (ThagA.ii.142; ThigA.68). Anojā, wife of
Mahā Kappina of Kukkutavatī, also came from the royal 
household of Madda (DhA.ii.116), as did Khemā, wife of Bimbisāra (ThigA.127).
</p>
<p>The wife of a Cakkavattī comes either from Uttarakuru or 
from the royal family of Madda (MA.ii.950; DA.ii.626; KhA.173).</p>
