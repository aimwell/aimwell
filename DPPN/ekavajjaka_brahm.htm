<p>A king. He was extremely obliging, and 
would grant an interview to any who desired it, no matter what the 
circumstances. He always allowed the person interviewing him to do so 
unattended, and thence came to be known as Ekavajjaka (“going alone”). Once, two 
of his ministers quarrelled because they wanted to rule over the same district. 
The king, realising the evil effects of greed, developed insight and became a 
Pacceka Buddha. </p>
<p>His verse is included in the 
Khaggavisāna Sutta. Sn.v.40; SnA.i.84f.</p>
