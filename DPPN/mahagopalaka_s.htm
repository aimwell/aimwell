  <h2>Mahāgopālaka Sutta</h2>

<p>Preached to the monks at Jetavana. A herdsman who is 
ignorant of form, has no eye for marks, does not get out ticks, does not dress 
sores, does not smoke out lairs, knows nothing either of fords or watering 
places, roads or pastures, milks the cows dry, and fails to pay special 
attention to the leaders of the herd — such a 
herdsman cannot look after his herd nor promote its increase. A monk who has the 
corresponding eleven bad qualities is not capable of showing growth and progress 
in the Dhamma and the Vinaya. M.i.220ff.; A.v.347ff.</p>
