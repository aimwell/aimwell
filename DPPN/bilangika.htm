<p>One of the <a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvāja</a> brothers. On hearing that the eldest 
of the clan had entered the Order, he went to the Buddha, and, unable to speak 
for rage, sat on one side, sulking. The Buddha preached to him, and he was 
pleased and entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course (S.i.164; 
DhA.iv.163).</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (SA.1.178f) that he had earned 
large profits by running a shop for different kinds of excellently prepared “congey” 
(kañjikā). The name Bilangika (bilanga being another name for such preparations) 
was given him by the Recensionists at the Third Council.</p>
