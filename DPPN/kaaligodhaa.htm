<p>A Sākiyan lady. She is declared to be a 
 
Sotāpanna, and a conversation between her and the Buddha, who visited her while 
staying at the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu, is recorded in the 
<a href="kaali_s.htm" title="ka/kaali_s.htm">Kāli Sutta</a> 
(S.v.396). In the sutta she is addressed as Godhā; she may have belonged to the 
same family as <a href="godatta_th.htm" title="g/godatta_th.htm">Godha</a> (q.v.). She was the mother of Bhaddiya Thera, declared to 
be the best of the monks of aristocratic birth (Thag.v.864; A.i.23; 
ThagA.ii.55).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.109) 
states that her name was Godhā, and that she was called Kāli because of her dark 
colour. She was the most senior of the Sākyan ladies of the time. Dhammapāla 
speaks of her as āgataphalā, viññātasāsanā. UdA.161.</p>
