<p>A garden at <a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>. In it was a 
Deer-park where the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> used to stay. On one such occasion
<a href="kakudha.htm" title="ka/kakudha.htm">Kakudha</a> came to 
see him (S.i.54), and also the Paribbājaka <a href="kundaliya.htm" title="ku/kundaliya.htm">Kuñdaliya</a> (S.v.73) who lived near by. 
Here were preached the Sāketa Sutta, (S.v.219) the
<a href="saketa_jat_068_237.htm" title="sa/saketa_jat_068_237.htm">Sāketa Jātaka</a> (J.i.308; 
DhA.iii.317ff.; SnA.531) and the <a href="jaraa_v_s.htm" title="j/jaraa_v_s.htm">Jarā Sutta</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> was staying there a nun of 
the <a href="jatila.htm" title="j/jatila.htm">Jatila</a> persuasion visited him and questioned him on the use of samadhi 
(A.iv.427-8).</p>
<p>The Thera <a href="jambugaamika.htm" title="j/jambugaamika.htm">Jambugāmiyaputta</a> (ThagA.i.86; 
SnA.531) dwelt there while yet a novice. Once the Buddha was staying at 
Añjanavana with a large company of monks and some of the monks slept on the 
sandbanks of the river Sarabhū near by. During the night floods rose and the 
Thera <a href="gavampati.htm" title="g/gavampati.htm">Gavampati</a> controlled the water by his mystic powers (Ibid., i.104; 
Thag.v.38).</p>
<p>The elder <a href="bhuuta.htm" title="b/bhuuta.htm">Bhūta</a> (ThagA.i.494) stayed in 
Añjana-vana while visiting his relatives in Sāketa, and the Thera 
<a href="anjanavaniya_th.htm" title="ay/anjanavaniya_th.htm">Añjanavaniya</a> 
spent the rainy season there on a couch (ThagA.i.127). There 
<a href="sujaataa.htm" title="s/sujaataa.htm">Sujātā</a> met the 
Buddha, and having listened to his discourse became an arahant (Thig.vv.145-50).</p>
<p>In ancient times the king of <a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a> used 
to hunt in this garden, thus it was that the deer <a href="nandiya.htm#6" title="n/nandiya.htm#6">Nandiya</a> met him (J.iii.270f).</p>
<p>The garden was so-called because it was 
thickly covered with añjanna-creepers that bore collyrium-coloured flowers. 
Others say that añjana is the name of a spreading tree (ThagA.i.128; 
SA.iii.195).</p>
