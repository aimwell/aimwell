<p><b>1. Bandhana Sutta</b>. The world is bound by pleasure; 
by abandoning craving, the world will become free. S.i.39.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bandhana Sutta.</b> The Buddha once heard that 
Pasenadi had taken men prisoners and had bound them in chains. He thereupon 
declared that the bonds of passion were stronger than any chains (S.i.76). The 
Commentary says (SA.i.115; cp. Bandhanāgāra Jātaka) that the incident was 
connected with the loss of the king’s turban diadem.</p>
