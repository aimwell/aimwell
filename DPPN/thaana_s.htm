<p>1. Thāna Sutta.-The four kinds of 
persons in the world — those who live on the fruit of their efforts, not of 
their deeds; those who live on the fruit of their deeds, not of their efforts; 
those who do both; those who do neither. A.ii.135.</p>
<p>2. Thāna Sutta.-A man’s virtue is to be 
understood only by association, his integrity by living with him, his courage by 
watching him in time of distress, his wisdom by conversing with him. A.ii.187ff.</p>
<p>3. Thāna Sutta.-Five things that make 
parents desire a son — he will help them, he will do his duty by them, he will 
keep up tradition, worthily possess his heritage and give merit to them when 
they are dead. A.iii.43.</p>

states — ageing which brings no decay, sickening no disease, dying no death, 
wasting no destruction, ending no end. A.iii.54f.</p>
<p>5. Thāna Sutta.-Four occasions that

unpleasant but profitable, when it is pleasant but unprofitable, when it is both 
pleasant and profitable. A.ii.118f.</p>
<p>6. Thāna Sutta.-Five things which should 
often be contemplated by everyone — the possibility of old age, disease, death,

one’s own deeds — and the purposes of such contemplation. A.iii.71ff.</p>

of the inhabitants of Uttarakuru, Jambudīpa and Tāvatimsa respectively. A.v.396.</p>

ability to retain the husband’s affection. S.iv.249.</p>
<p>9. Thāna Sutta.-The conditions that 
promote lust, malevolence, sloth, torpor, excitement and flurry, doubt and

things are caused and occasioned, and the fruits of actions. S.v.304.</p>
