<p>The Bodhisatta was once a tree-sprite in 
a jambu-grove and saw how a crow, flattered by the words of a jackal sitting 
under the tree, dropped fruits for him to eat, praising his breeding. The sprite 
drove them both away as being liars.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
report that Devadatta and Kokālika were going about singing each other’s 
praises. J.ii.438f; cp. Anta Jātaka.</p>
