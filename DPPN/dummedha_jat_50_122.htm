<p><b>1. Dummedha Jātaka (No.50).</b>-The 
Bodhisatta was once born as Brahmadatta, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. Seeing that his 
subjects were much given to offering sacrifices to the gods in course of which 
animals were killed and other sins committed, he made proclamation, soon after 
becoming king, that he had made a vow to offer in sacrifice all those of his 
subjects who were addicted to the Five Sins and walked upon the ten paths of 
unrighteousness. His ministers were sent to look for such people, and the 
proclamation had the desired effect (J.i.259f).</p>
<p>For the introductory story see the 
Mahākanha Jātaka.</p>

<p><b>2. Dummedha Jātaka (No.122).</b>-The 
Bodhisatta was once the state elephant of the Magadha king of Rājagaha. When the 
king rode in procession, the people had eyes only for the elephant, and the 
king, in envy, schemed to have the elephant thrown down a precipice. The mahout 
discovering this, flew on the elephant’s back to Benares. The king of Benares 
welcomed them and, with their help, obtained the sovereignty of all India.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta’s envy of people’s praise of the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with 
the Magadha king, Sāriputta with the king of Benares and Ānanda with the mahout. 
J.i.444f.</p>
