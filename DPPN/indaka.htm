<p><b>1. Indaka</b>.-A yakkha who lived in 
Indakūta, near Rājagaha. When the Buddha was staying at Indakūta, the yakkha 
questioned him as to how the soul finds its material counterpart. The Buddha, in 
reply, described how the embryo evolved into its final shape by the laws of 
physical growth and not by a soul’s fiat (S.i.206).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.231) that the 
yakkha was an animist (puggalavādin).</p>
<p><b>2. Indaka</b>.-A deva. He had been a 
youth who gave a spoonful of food to Anuruddha. In consequence he was born in 
Tāvatimsa as a deva of great power and majesty. When the Buddha went to 
Tāvatimsa to preach the Abhidhamma, in the assembly of the gods who gathered 
there, those of lesser powers had to yield place to their superiors. Thus Ankura 
(q.v.), who, at the start, was very near the Buddha, found himself twelve 
leagues away. But not so Indaka; the power of his merit was very great and no 
deva was mighty enough to displace him; he had been lucky in the recipient of 
his gift. Ankura’s generosity, much more lavish than Indaka’s, had been bestowed 
on men who were not holy. Such was the explanation the Buddha gave in the 
assembly of the gods, on seeing the discrepancy between the positions of the two 
devas, Indaka surpassing the other in ten qualities. (Pv.pp.27f; PvA.136-8; 
DhA.iii.219-20; 80-1).</p>
<p>In one place, in the Petavatthu (p.28, 
v.69), Indaka is called a yakkha, but the Commentary (p.139) says it means deva-putta. 
He is, therefore, different from Indaka (1).</p>
<p><b>Indaka Sutta</b>.-Contains the 
question asked by Indaka and the Buddha’s reply. (S.i.206).</p>
