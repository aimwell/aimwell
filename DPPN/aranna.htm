  <h2>Arañña</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Four great Araññas are often mentioned 
in literature (E.g., M.i.378). They had once been the sites of very populous and 
prosperous kingdoms, but had later been destroyed by the gods because of 
offences committed by their kings against holy men. </p>
<p>The four Mahā Araññas are: Dandaka°, 
Kālinga°, Mejjha°, and Mātanga°. </p>
<p>Details of these are found under each 
respective name.</p>
