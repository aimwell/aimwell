  </li>
</ul>
<p>A market town near Kosambī. The Buddha went there and was 
warned by cowherds and others not to approach Ambatittha as a fierce Nāga dwelt 
there. 
</p>
<p>Sāgata Thera, hearing this, went to Ambatittha and subdued the Nāga, 
afterwards rejoining the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā (Vin.iv.108f.; J.i.360f). 
</p>
<p>The town is probably identical with Bhaddavatī (q.v.), and 
was in the Cetiya Country. Vin.iv.108.</p>
