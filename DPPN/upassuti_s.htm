  <h2>Upassuti Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Once when the Buddha was staying in the 
Gi침jak캐vasatha in N캐tik캐, he meditated in solitude and uttered a teaching 
setting forth how, from the objects and the senses, arise consciousness and 
contact and, ultimately, the whole body of Ill. A certain monk overheard this, 
and when the Buddha saw him, he asked the monk to learn the discourse by heart 
and bear it in mind, because it would lead to the righteous life. S.iv.90f.</p>
