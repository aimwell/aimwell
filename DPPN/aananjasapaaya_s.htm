  <h2>Ānañjasappāya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached to the monks, with Ānanda at 
their head, by the Buddha at Kammassadhamma in the Kuru country. It deals with 
real Permanence (ānañjasappāya) and with the various ways of meditating on 
impassibility and the attainments and true release. True deathlessness is only 
the heart’s deliverance (anupādā cittassa vimokkho), and there are several 
stages of the paths that lead to it (M.ii.261ff). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.851) says 
that this sutta described the arahantship of the Sukkhavipassakā. Arahantship is 
mentioned in nine different connections in the sutta, which is therefore praised 
as being well taught (sukathitam).</p>
