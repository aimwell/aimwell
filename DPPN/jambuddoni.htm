<p>A mountain in the Malayarattha in 
Ceylon. Vijayabahu III. built on its summit a town which he made his capital. 
For a time the Tooth Relic and the Alms Bowl were there (Cv.lxxxi.15, 29) but 
were later removed to Billagiri (Cv.lxxxii.7ff). Parakkamabāhu II. also used 
Jambuddoni as his capital, but Vijayabāhu IV. moved the seat of government to 
Pulatthipura (Cv.lxxxx.13). Later, we find Bhuvanekabāhu I. being crowned in 
Jambuddoni, though his capital was in Subhagiri (Cv.xc.30). Vijayabāhu III. 
built the Vijayasundarārāma (q.v.) on Jambuddoni.</p>
