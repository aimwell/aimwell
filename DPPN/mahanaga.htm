<a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>. While the Buddha

<p><b>2. Mahānāga.</b> Son of Mutasiva and viceroy of Devānampiyatissa. His wife was 
Anulā, for whose ordination Sanghamittā came over from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xiv.56; Dpv.xi.6; 
xvii.75). His second wife was a foolish woman who tried to poison him in order to 
get the throne for her son. While he was building the Taraccha tank, she sent him 
some mangoes, the top one of which, intended for him, was poisoned. But it was her 
son who ate the mango and died. Mahānāga thereupon went to Rohana, where he founded 
the dynasty of that name at Mahāgāma. His son was Yatthālayaka Tissa. Mahānāga built 
the Nāgamahā vihāra and the Uddhakandara vihāra. Mhv.xxii.2ff. </p>

<p><b>6. Mahānāga Thera.</b> 
Incumbent of Bhūtārāma. As a mark of favour, Kanitthatissa 
built for him the Ratanapāsāda at Abhayagiri vihāra. Mhv.xxxvi.7.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Mahānāga Thera.</b> 
Incumbent of Samudda vihāra. He was among those who accepted the gift 
of a meal by Prince Sāliya, in his birth as a blacksmith. MT. 606.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Mahānāga Thera.</b> 
Incumbent of Kālavallimandapa. He was among those who accepted the meal 
given by Sāliya in his previous birth (MT. 606). He was one of the last to attain 
arahantship among those who left the world with the Bodhisatta in various births 
(J.iv.490). He did not sleep for seven years, after which he practised continual 
meditation for sixteen years, becoming an arahant at the end of that time. SNA.i.56; 
MA.i.209; SA.iii.155.</p>
<p>His fame was great, and there is a story of a brahmin who came all the way 
  from Pātaliputta to Kālavallimandapa in Rohana to visit him. The brahmin entered 
  the Order under him and became an arahant (AA.i.384). Once, while Mahānāga was 
  begging alms at Nakulanagara, he saw a nun and offered her a meal. As she had 
  no bowl, he gave her his, with the food ready in it. After she had eaten and washed 
  the bowl, she gave it back to him saying, “Henceforth there will be no fatigue 
  for you when begging for alms.” Thereafter the Elder was never given alms worth 
  less than a kahāpana. The nun was an arahant. DhSA.399.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>11. Mahānāga Thera.</b> 
He and his brother, Cūlanāga, householders of Vasālanagara, renounced the world 
and became arahants. One day, while visiting their own village, they went to their 
mother&#39;s house for alms. The mother, not quite sure who they were, asked if they 
were her sons. But they, not wishing for any bonds of affection, gave an evasive 
reply. SA.ii.125.</p>
<hr>

for alms and while sitting there entered into trance. The house caught fire and 
all the others fled. When the fire was put out the Thera was discovered unhurt, 
and the villagers did him great honour. Finding his attainments discovered, he rose 
into the air and went to Piyangudīpa. Vsm.706.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>14. Mahānāga.</b> 
A king of 
Ceylon, mentioned in the Dhammasangani Commentary (DhSA.399). While travelling to

he lived. (DhSA.399).</p>

<hr>
<p><b>16. Mahānāga.</b> Nephew 
of Bhayasīva. During a time of famine he sold his upper garment and obtained food 
for a man learned in magic spells. The latter, in gratitude, took him to the Gokannasamudda, 
and there, having conjured up a Nāga, prophesied Mahānāga&#39;s future. Mahānāga entered 
Silākāla&#39;s service, and was sent by him to collect revenue in Rohana. Later he was 
made Andhasenāpati, and he established himself master of Rohana. He once attempted 
to fight against Dāthāpabhuti, but soon gave up the attempt. Taking advantage of 
the confusion in Kittisirimegha&#39;s dominions, Mahānāga advanced against him, killed 
him, and seized the throne. Among his benefactions was the grant of the village 
of Jambalambaya to Uttara vihāra, Tintinika to Mahāvihira, and Vasabha in Uddhagāma 
to Jetavana vihāra, together with three hundred fields for the supply of rice soup. 
He also gave Cīramātikavāra to Mahāvihāra and instituted a gift of rice soup. He 
renovated the Mayūraparivena and Anurārāma in the Mahādevarattakuruva vihāra in 
Kāsikhanda. He reigned for only three years (556-9 A.C.), and was succeeded by his 
nephew, Aggabodhi I. (Cv.xli.69ff), who built a vihāra in his memory and assigned 
it to an Elder versed in the Tipitaka. Cv.xlii.24; Cv.Trs.i.68, n.2.</P>
