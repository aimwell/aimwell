<p><b>1. Atimuttaka.</b>-A cemetery near <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, 
where robbers used to deposit their stolen goods. Two ascetics, Mandavya and 
Dīpāyana, lived there. J.iv.28f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Atimuttaka.</b>-A novice, nephew of Sankicca. On his way to his parents to obtain, at Sankicca’s behest, permission 
for the higher ordination, he was attacked by thieves; he was set free on 
promising not to mention their whereabouts. Later, he saw his parents take the 
same road, but refrained from warning them on account of his promise. The 
thieves, marvelling at his integrity, wished to be ordained under him. He took 
them to Sankicca and later on to the Buddha. DhA.ii.252-3; SA.i.44-5; but see 
ThagA.ii.11f., where his encounter with the thieves is mentioned as having taken 
place after he became arahant. The rest of the story also is different.</p>
<p>In Atthadassi’s time he was a rich 
householder and held great almsgivings for the monks after the Buddha’s death 
(Ap.i.88).</p>
<p>He is mentioned as one who shone in the 
assembly of relatives (SA.i.45). His name is often spelt Adhimuttaka.</p>
