<h4>1. Nāgadatta Thera</h4>
<p>He once lived in a forest tract in Kosala and was inclined 
to be indolent. A deva, noticing this, admonished him, and it is said that 
Nagadatta paid heed to the warning. S.i.200.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nāgadatta</h4>
<p>A deva, living, according to one account (SA.i.217), in 
Kelāsapabbata; according to another (ThagA.i.138; AA.i.139), in 
<a href="gandhamaadana.htm" title="g/gandhamaadana.htm">Gandhamādana</a>. 
Anuruddha, when residing in the Chaddantavana, used to pass by his dwelling, and 
the deva gave him milk rice with lotus honey. When Sivalī visited Gandhamādana 
with five hundred monks, the deva gave them milk rice one day and clarified 
butter the next. When the monks inquired how he could get milk and ghee, he told 
them that this was the result of a gift of milk rice given by him in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha.</p>

<h4>Nāgadatta Sutta</h4>
