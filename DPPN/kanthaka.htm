<p>The horse on which Gotama left his 
father’s palace, accompanied by his attendant Channa. It is said that when 
Kanthaka was saddled for the journey, he realised the importance of the hour and 
neighed loudly for joy, but the gods muffled the sound of his neighing as also 
that of his footsteps as he galloped through the streets; ordinarily the sound 
of his neighing and galloping could be heard throughout Kapilavatthu. He was 
eighteen cubits long from neck to tail and proportionately broad, quite white in 
colour, like a clean conch-shell.</p>
<p>In this journey of Gotama, Channa held 
on to Kanthaka’s tail. The horse had the strength, had it been necessary, to 
clear the ramparts of the city, eighteen hands high, at one bound, with the 
prince and Channa on his back. Just outside Kapilavatthu the prince stopped the 
horse, in order to take a last look at the city. A cetiya was later erected on 
this spot and called Kanthakanivatta-cetiya. The horse travelled thirty leagues 
between midnight and the following morning, as far as the river Anomā. It is 
said that Kanthaka could travel round the whole cakka-vāla in one night. With 
one leap the horse cleared the river, which was eight fathoms wide. On arriving 
on the opposite bank, the Bodhisatta gave orders that Kanthaka should be taken 
back to Kapilavatthu, but Kanthaka kept looking back at his master, and when the 
Bodhisatta disappeared from view the horse died of a broken heart, and was 
reborn in Tāvatimsa under the name of Kanthaka-devaputta. (J.i.62-5; 
Mtu.ii.159f., 165, 189, 190; VibhA.34, etc.; Buddhacarita, v.3, 68; vi.53ff).</p>
<p>Kanthaka was born on the same day as the 
Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA.106, 234, etc.). In heaven he had a magnificent palace 
of veluriya gems, which Moggallāna visited on one of his tours in Tāvatimsa. 
(Vv.73f;-VVA.311-18; see also DhA.i.70; iii.195).</p>
