<p>A “shrine” of the <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Mallas</a> to the east of 
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusināra</a>, where 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> body was cremated (D.ii.160-1). 
 
</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> explains that the Makutabandhana was a Hall in which the Malla 
chiefs put on their ornaments on festival days. It was called a cetiya because 
it was decorated (cittakatthena pan'esa cetiyam).</p>
<p>DA.ii.596; see also Dvy. 201. Hiouen Thsang’s description 
(Beal, op. cit., ii.37) of the stūpa erected at what is evidently Makutabandhana 
suggests a different explanation. It was there that the Mallas laid aside their 
diamond maces (? makuta) and fell prostrate on the ground with grief at the 
Buddha’s death.</p>
