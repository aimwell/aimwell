<p>Once Khemā, wife of King Bahuputtaka of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, dreamed 
of a golden goose preaching the Law and craved for her dream to come true. The 
king had a lake, called Khemā, dug outside the city, and put into it various 
kinds of food in order to entice the golden geese which lived in Cittakūta. They 
came, led by Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta, who was caught in the snare laid by the 
king’s hunter. The Bodhisatta gave the alarm, and all the geese fled except 
Sumukha, his captain, who refused to leave him even though told to do so. When 
the hunter came, Sumukha persuaded him to let Dhatarattha free and to take him 
instead. The hunter agreed, but when the Bodhisatta heard of the reason for his 
capture, he, too, insisted on going before the king. Both geese were, therefore, 
led before the king, who was overjoyed. Dhatarattha preached the Law and the 
queen’s craving was appeased; the geese were then allowed to fly away.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Ānanda’s readiness 
to give his life for the Buddha. Channa is identified with the huntsman, 
Sāriputta with the king, Khemā Therī with the queen, and Ānanda with Sumukha. 
J.iv.423-30; cf. the Mahāhamsa Jātaka.</p>
