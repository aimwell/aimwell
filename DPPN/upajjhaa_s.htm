</ul>
<p>A monk goes to his teacher and confesses 
to him the difficulty he experiences in living the celibate life profitably. The 
teacher takes him to the Buddha, who suggests to him a different way of conduct. 
The monk acts according to the Buddha’s advice and becomes an arahant. On being 
informed of this, the Buddha makes it a topic for a sermon. A.iii.69-71.</p>
