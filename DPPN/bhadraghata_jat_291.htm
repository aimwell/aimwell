  <h2>Bhadraghata Jﾄ》aka (No.291)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a rich merchant with an only son. 
He did great good and was born as Sakka. The son squandered all his wealth in 
drinking and amusements and fell into poverty. Sakka took pity on him and gave 
him the Bhadraghata (Wishing Cup), asking him to take care of it. But one day, 
when the son was drunk, he threw the cup into the air and smashed it, thus 
reducing himself once again to misery.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a ne'er-do-well 
nephew of Anﾄ》hapindika. His uncle helped him again and again, but he squandered 
everything, and one day Anﾄ》hapindika had him turned out of his house. The two 
squanderers were the same. J.ii.431f.</p>
