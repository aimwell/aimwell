<p>1. Āsīvisa Sutta.-Preached at Sāvatthi. 
Man has to tend four snakes of fierce heat and fearful venom — the four 
mahābhūtas; be is constantly followed by five murderous foes — the five 
upādānakkhandhā; he is pursued by a murderous housebreaker with uplifted sword — 
passionate desire (nandirāga); while trying to escape them, he wanders into an 
empty village, where everything is empty — the sixfold personal sense sphere (ajjhattikāyatana), 
and into it come village-plunderers — the six fold external sense-spheres (bāhirāyatana.) 
Fleeing from there he comes to a broad sheet of water beset with danger on the 
hither side; the further side is secure from fear, but there is no boat and no 
bridge — the fivefold flood (ogha), the hither shore being sakkāya and the 
further shore nibbāna. S.iv.172-b.</p>
<p>2. Āsīvisa Sutta.-There are four kinds 
of snakes in the world: the venomous but not fierce, the fierce but not 
venomous, the one that is both and the one that is neither. Similarly there are 
four kinds of persons: the one quick to get angry but with short-lived anger, 
the one slow to get angry but with lasting anger, etc. (A.ii.110-11)</p>
<p>Āsīvisa Vagga.-The nineteenth chapter of 
the Salāyatana Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikāya. J.iv.172-204.</p>
