</ul>
<p>Four monks came to the Buddha and asked 
him for a topic of meditation. He gave them various topics and they, having 
retired to various places, all became arahants: one by understanding the 
six-fold sphere, the second the five khandhas, the third the four mahābhūtas, 
and the fourth the eighteen dhātu. They returned and related to the Buddha each 
the particular excellence attained by him, and one of them asked the Buddha how 
all these methods could lead to Nibbāna. The Buddha related a story of the past 
where four sons of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, having asked their charioteer 
to show them a kimsuka-tree, are shown the tree at four different times: when 
the buds were just sprouting, when the leaves were green, at the time of 
blossoming, and at the time of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>When asked to describe the tree, the 
first likened it to a burnt stump, the second to a banyan tree, the third to a 
piece of meat, and the fourth to an acacia. The matter was referred to the king, 
who solved the difficulty.</p>
<p>The king was the Bodhisatta. J.ii.265f</p>
