<p>A yakkha resident in a palm tree outside 
Rājagaha. Kālavilangika’s wife, disguised as a man, taking food from the palace 
to an impaled man, passed under his tree and was seized as his prey. But on 
learning that she was the king’s messenger, the yakkha released her and asked 
her to convey the news that Dīghataphala’s wife Kālī, daughter of the god Sumana, 
had given birth to a son. In return for this service, Dīghataphala gave the 
messenger the treasure buried under the tree. She went about shouting the news, 
and Sumana, hearing it, gave her more treasure. MA.ii.818.</p>
