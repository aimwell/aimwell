<p><b>1. Mānatthaddha. </b>A brahmin of Sāvatthi who, because 
of his great pride respected no one. One day he came upon the Buddha preaching 
to a large crowd of people and stood near, on one side. The Buddha, seeing him, 
preached on the vanity of pride; Mānatthaddha understood, and, falling at the 
Buddha’s feet, worshipped him. And then, in answer to his question, the Buddha 
told him of those to whom respect should be shown, among whom the arahants are 
perfect. Mānatthaddha became the Buddha’s follower. S.i.177f; cp. Jenta.</p>

<p><b>2. Mānatthaddha.</b> A Pacceka Buddha mentioned in a 
nominal list. M.iii.71; ApA.i.107.</p>
