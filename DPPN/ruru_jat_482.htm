<p>Once, in Benares, there lived Mahādhanaka, son of a rich man. His parents had 
taught him nothing, and after their death he squandered all their wealth and 
fell into debt. Unable to escape his creditors, he summoned them and took them 
to the banks of the Ganges, promising to show them buried treasure. Arrived 
there, he jumped into the river. He lamented aloud as he was being carried away 
by the stream. The Bodhisatta was then a golden hued deer living on the banks of 
the river, and, hearing the man’s wailing of anguish, he swam into the stream 
and saved him. After having ministered to him, the deer set him on the road to 
Benares and asked him to tell no one of the existence of the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The day the man reached Benares, proclamation was being made that the Queen 
Consort, <a href="khemaa.htm" title="ku/khemaa.htm">Khemā</a>, having dreamed of a golden deer preaching to her, longed for the 
dream to come true. Mahādhanaka offered to take the king to such a deer and a 
hunt was organized. When the Bodhisatta saw the king with his retinue, he went 
up to the king and told him the story of Mahādhanaka. The king denounced the 
traitor and gave the Bodhisatta a boon that henceforth all creatures should be 
free from danger. Afterwards the Bodhisatta was taken to the city, where he saw 
the queen. Flocks of deer, now free from fear, devoured men’s crops; but the 
king would not go against his promise and the Bodhisatta begged his herds to 
desist from doing damage.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta’s</a> ingratitude and wickedness. 
Devadatta was Mahādhanaka and Ānanda the king. J.iv.255 63; the story is 
included in the Jātakamālā (No. 26).</p>
