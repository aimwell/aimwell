<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Paduma, 
son of the chief queen of the <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> king. He had six brothers. The king, 
becoming suspicious of his sons, ordered them to leave the kingdom. They went 
away with their wives, and coming to a region where no food was to be had, they 
killed their wives one by one and ate their flesh.  </p>
<p>The Bodhisatta managed to 
save his wife by foregoing a share of the meal each day, and fled with her. 
During the flight the Bodhisatta gave his wife some of his blood to drink, she 
being so thirsty. Later they lived in a hut on the bank of the Ganges. One day 
the Bodhisatta rescued from the river a thief with his limbs cut off who was 
drifting down stream in a boat. At first the Bodhisatta’s wife would not even 
look at the man, but soon she conceived a passion for him and threw her husband 
down a precipice. The Bodhisatta fell on a fig-tree, and after some time climbed 
down with the help of an iguana. He went to Benares and established his claim to 
his father’s kingdom. His erstwhile wife, wandering from place to place with the 
cripple on her shoulders, gained great reputation as a devoted wife. One day she 
came to Benares. There the king recognised her and revealed her treachery 
(J.ii.115-21).</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
backsliding monk. The details are given in the 
<a href="ummadantii_jat_527.htm" title="u/ummadantii_jat_527.htm">Ummadantī Jātaka</a>.</p>

iguana.</p>
