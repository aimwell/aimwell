<hr>
<h4>2. Padhāna Sutta</h4>

<h4>3. Padhāna Sutta</h4>
<p>The Buddha describes how, when he gave himself up to 
meditation in order to win Enlightenment, Māra (Namuci) came to tempt him with 
his eightfold army of lust, discontent, hunger and thirst, craving, cowardice, 
doubt, hypocrisy and stupor. But the Buddha was firm, and Māra retired 
discomfited. SN.vs.425 49.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Padhāna Sutta</h4>
