<p>A group of thirty young men, converted by the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>.  </p>
<p>They 
had gone picnicking with their wives in a forest glade between 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Bārānasi</a> and 
<a href="uruvelaa.htm" title="u/uruvelaa.htm">Uruvelā</a>. One of them had no wife, and for him they found a courtesan; but she 
awaited the opportunity and ran away with their goods. </p>
<p>While seeking for her, they saw the Buddha and enquired if 
he had seen a woman. But he answered, should they not rather seek the “self” 
than a woman. They all agreed thereto, and he preached to them. At the end of 
the sermon they realized the Truth and were ordained (Vin.i.23f.; DhA.ii.33f). </p>
<p>Their conversion was one of the subjects sculptured in the 
Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa. Mhv.xxx.79.</p>
<p>
According to the Extended Mahāvamsa (i.298) they were the step-brothers of the 
king of <a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>.</p>
