<h2>Mahāsaccaka Sutta</h2>
<p>Saccaka visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and 
questions him on the disciplining of the body and the mind. The Buddha describes 
to him the training he underwent from the time of leaving the world to that of 
his Enlightenment, stopping at no exertion, avoiding no austerities till, in the 
end, wisdom came to him, and he realized that bliss could not be experienced 
with an emaciated body. The Pañcavaggiyas, who had been with him till then, left 
him in disgust. But he persevered, and, in the end, destroyed the āsavas. 
Saccaka, addressed in the sutta as Aggivessana, expresses great admiration for 
the Buddha and acknowledges his superiority over other teachers. M.i.237 51; see 
Thomas: op. cit., 58.</p>
