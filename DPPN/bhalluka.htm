<p>Nephew of Dīghajantu.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>He received a message from Elāra, in consequence of which 
he landed at Mahātittha in Ceylon with sixty thousand men, only to find that 
Elāra was dead and had been cremated seven days earlier. Bhalluka thereupon 
marched on Anurādhapura and pitched his camp at Kolambahālaka. Dutthagāmani 
marched against him, and a battle took place in the precincts of the Mahāvihāra. 
Bhalluka shot an arrow at the king, and, believing that it had pierced his 
mouth, set up a great shout, but Phussadeva, who was seated on Kandula 
immediately behind the king, shot at Bhalluka, who thereupon fell dead prostrate 
at the feet of the king. Mhv.xxv.77ff.</p>
