<h4>1. Pañcālacanda</h4>
<p>A devaputta who visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered 
a verse to the effect that the man who understands jhāna finds room even among 
crowding obstacles. The Buddha corrects him, saying that those who are mindful 
and self possessed know the way to Nibbāna (S.i.48). This discussion forms the 
basis for the Pañcāla Sutta (above.) It is probably this same deva who is 
mentioned as a Mahāyakkha in the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.205) who is to be 
invoked by the Buddha’s followers in time of need.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pañcālacanda</h4>
<p>A handsome brahmin youth with whom the queen of a Kosala 
king misconducted herself on various occasions. She first saw and fell in love 
with him when on the way to visit her son; thereafter she found various excuses 
for coming to the city where he lived. This is one of the stories related by 
Kunāla. J.v.425, 430f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Pañcālacanda</h4>
<p>A former birth of kunāla. He was the chaplain of Kandari, 
king of Benares, and helped the king in discovering the love intrigues of his 
queen, Kinnarā, with a misshapen cripple. When Kandari wished to have the queen 
beheaded, Pañcālacanda interceded on her behalf and convinced the king, by 
recalling to his mind several experiences they had lived through together, that 
the queen’s sin was due to her nature as woman. J.v.437ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Pañcālacanda</h4>
<p>Son of Cūlanī Brahmadatta. He was sent by Mahosadha to be 
kept as hostage to King Videha, when Cūlanī threatened to harm the latter; but 
Videha treated him like a younger brother. Pañcālacandī was sister to 
Pañcālacanda. J.vi.434, 435, 454, 462, 466.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Pañcālacanda Sutta</h4>
<p>Recounts the discussion between the Buddha and the 
devaputta Pañcālacanda (1). S.i.48.</p>
