<p>A Paribbājaka who joined the Order and soon after left it. 
He then went about proclaiming in Rājagaha that he knew the Dhamma and Vinaya of 
the Sākyaputta monks, and that was why he had left their Order. The Buddha, 
being told of this, visited the Paribbājakārāma, on the banks of the Sappinikā, 
and challenged Sarabha to repeat his statement. Three times the challenge was 
uttered, but Sarabha sat silent. The Buddha then declared to the Paribbājakas 
that no one could say that his claim to Enlightenment was unjustified, or that 
his dhamma, if practised, did not lead to the destruction of Ill. After the 
Buddha’s departure, the Paribbājakas taunted and abused Sarabha (A.i.185ff).</p>
<p>It is said (AA.i.412 f ) that Sarabha joined the Order at 
the request of the Paribbājakas. They had failed to find any fault with the 
Buddha’s life, and thought that his power was due to an “āvattanīmāyā,” which he 
and his disciples practised once a fortnight behind closed doors. Sarabha agreed 
to find it out and learn it. He therefore went to Gijjhakūta, where he showed 
great humility to all the resident monks. An Elder, taking pity on him, ordained 
him. In due course he learned the pātimokkha, which, he realized, was what the 
Paribbājakas took to be the Buddha’s “māyā.” Having learned it, he went back to 
the Paribbājakas, taught it to them, and with them went about in the city 
boasting that he knew the Buddha’s teaching and had found it worthless.</p>
