<p>1. Ekapundarīka.-A paribbājakārāma, the 
residence of Vacchagotta (M.i.481f ).It was near the Kūtāgārasālā in the 
Mahāvana of Vesāli. The Buddha went there to see Vacchagotta, and it was on this 
occasion that the Tevijja-Vacchagotta Sutta was preached (M.i.481f). Buddhaghosa 
says (MA.ii.673) that the place was so called because in it grew a solitary 
White Mango Tree (setambarukkha).</p>
<p>2. Ekapundarīka.-An elephant belonging 
to Pasenadi. It was while riding on this elephant that the king met Ānanda. The 
king followed the Elder to the monastery, and their conversation is recorded in 
the Bāhitika Sutta (M.ii.112f).</p>
<p>Over the elephant’s ribs there was a 
white spot (pandaratthāna), the size of a palmyra-fruit, hence his name 
(MA.ii.752).</p>
<p>3. Ekapundarīka Thera.-An arahant. 
Ninety-four kappas ago he met the Pacceka Buddha, Romasa, and gave him a 
lotus-flower as an offering of homage. Ap.i.238.</p>
