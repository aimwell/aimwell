<p><b>1. Parakkamapura. </b>A town built by Parakkamabāhu I. 
It was evidently another name for Pulatthinagara, which Parakkambāhu laid out 
and embellished in various ways. Cv.lxxiv.15; see also lxxii.151; for the 
identification see Cv.Trs.ii.22, n.1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Parakkamapura. </b>A stronghold in South India, 
built at Kundukāla by the general Lankāpura. The Chronicle contains a vivid 
account of a battle, which took place just outside the gates of the stronghold 
between the forces of Lankāpura and of Kulasekhara. But no more is heard of the 
stronghold; it may have been abandoned in favor of another. Cv.lxxvi.121, 133, 
147, 150.</p>
