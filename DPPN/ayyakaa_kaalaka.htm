<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a bull 
as black as jet. While still a young calf he was given by his owners to an old 
woman, who reared him like a son; hence his name (“Grannie’s Blackie”). The 
village lads used to ride on him for play. Once he saw a merchant trying to get 
his five hundred carts across a ford; the merchant’s bulls were not strong 
enough for the task, and seeing the Bodhisatta the merchant tried to make use of 
his services. The Bodhisatta agreed only after he had been promised a thousand. 
The task completed, the merchant tried to cheat him, paying only half the 
promised amount.</p>
<p>But the bull would not let him go till 
all the money had been paid. The earnings so obtained he took to the old woman, 
who was greatly pleased. J.i.194-6.</p>
