<p><b>1. Gandha.</b>-The name of a family of 
elephants; each elephant has the strength of one million men. VibhA.397; 
AA.ii.822; UdA.403, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Gandha.</b>-A setthi of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. On realising that his ancestors had died leaving immense wealth, which they had 
failed to enjoy, he started to spend large sums of money on luxuries, and one 
full-moon day he decorated the city and invited the people to watch him taking a 
meal. Among the assembled multitude was a villager, who felt that he would die 
unless he could obtain a morsel of Gandha’s rice. When this was told to Gandha 
he suggested that the man should work for him for three years, taking in payment 
a bowl of his rice. The villager agreed and henceforth became known as 
Bhattabhatika. At the end of the three years Gandha kept his promise and gave 
orders that Bhattabhatika should enjoy all his master’s own splendours for one 
day, and asked all the members of his household, except his wife Cintāmanī, to 
wait on him. When Bhattabhatika sat down to eat, a Pacceka Buddha appeared 
before him; Bhattabhatika gave his food to the Pacceka Buddha who, in sight of 
all those that had gathered to watch Bhattabhatika’s splendour, went through the 
air to Gandhamādana. When Gandha heard of what bad happened, he gave one-half of 
all his possessions to Bhattabhatika in return for a share of the merit he had 
gained. DhA.iii.87ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Gandha Sutta</b>.-The scents of the world 
spread only along with the wind and not against it; the fragrance of a good 
man’s virtue travels everywhere. A.i.225; cp. J.iii.291; Mil.333.</p>
