<p>One of Dutthagāmani’s chief warriors. He 
was the son of Mahānāga of Nitthulavitthika and owed his name to his dwarfish 
stature. He pulled up imbara-trees from a forest clearing, thus demonstrating 
his enormous strength. Kākavannatissa, hearing of this, sent for him to the 
court (Mhv.xxiii.49ff; the Rasavāhini ii.28, says he subdued a yakkha named 
Jayasena). He took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura, using a 
coconut-palm as weapon (Mhv.xxv.27, 32, 44f).</p>
<p>It is said (MT.452) that in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha he gave daily milk rice to the monks.</p>
<p>See also Ras.ii.87f, which says that he 
was so called because he was short, but that according to the Uttara-vihāra 
monks he was given the name because, when he went hunting, he killed animals by 
dashing them on kotthayimbara-trees. Once when he was holding a feast in his 
house, after defeating the Damilas, a Yakkha, named Jayasena of Aritthapabbata, 
happened to pass by, and, entering the house, fell in love with G.’s wife. G. 
challenged him to a fight and defeated him. He celebrated the victory for seven 
days and went to the palace drunk. Being refused admission, he swam across to 
Kāvīrapattana, and, having gone as far as the Himālaya in search of holy monks, 
was about to kill himself in despair when an arahant Thera appeared before him 
and ordained him. He later attained arahantship.</p>
