<p>King of Ceylon (A.D. 133-102). He was 
the nephew of King Ānanda gāmani Abhaya. Ānanda was succeeded by his son 
Cūlābhaya and he by his younger sister Sīvalī. After Sīvalī had reigned for four 
months, Ilanaga dethroned her and became king himself. In the first year of his 
reign he incurred the displeasure of the powerful Lambakannas and was deprived 
of his throne and taken captive. It is said that the king was rescued from 
prison by his state elephant and that he escaped to Rohana. Three years later he 
gave battle to the Lambakannas at Kapallakkhanda and massacred most of them. He 
had the noses and toes of the rest cut off as punishment.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by his son Candamukha 
Siva. To his state elephant, who had helped him, he gave the tract of land 
called Hatthibhoga. During his exile in Rohana, Ilanaga built two tanks, the 
Tissa and the Dūra, and restored the Nāgamahāvihāra, which he gave to Mahāpaduma, 
thera of Tulādhāra, who had preached to him the Kapi Jātaka. He also gave land 
for its maintenance. Mhv.xxxv.14-45; Dpv.xxi.41f.</p>
