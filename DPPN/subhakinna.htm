<p>A class of Brahmas who occupy the ninth Rūpa-world; a 
division of the Subha devā (M.iii.102; D.ii.69; M.i.2, etc. Compendium, p.138). 
Beings are born in that world as a result of developing the third jhāna, and 
their life span is sixty four kappas (MA.i.553 and SA.i.162; but see A.ii.127, 
129, where their life is given as four kappas). </p>
<p>They are filled and pervaded with happiness and are 
serenely blissful; they experience only sublime happiness, unlike the 
<a href="aabhassara.htm" title="aa/aabhassara.htm">Abhassarā</a>, 
who exclaim in their joy. (D.iii.219) They agree both in body and in perceptive 
power (A.iv.401; cf.iv.40). They radiate light from their bodies in a steady 
brightness and not in flashes (AA.ii.713; cf. PSA.80). When the world is 
destroyed by water, the world of the Subhakinhas forms the limit to which the 
water rises. PSA.256.</p>
