  <h2>Tāvatimsa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The second of the six deva-worlds, the 
first being the <a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world. Tāvatimsa stands at the top of Mount 
<a href="sineru.htm" title="s/sineru.htm">Sineru</a> (or Sudassana). <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> is king of both worlds, but lives in Tāvatimsa. 
Originally it was the abode of the <a href="asura.htm" title="ay/asura.htm">Asuras</a>; but when
<a href="maagha.htm" title="ma/maagha.htm">Māgha</a> was born as 
Sakka and dwelt with his companions in Tāvatimsa he disliked the idea of sharing 
his realm with the Asuras, and, having made them intoxicated, he hurled them 
down to the foot of Sineru, where the Asurabhavana was later established.  </p>
<p>The 
chief difference between these two worlds seems to have been that the Pāricchattaka tree grew in Tāvatimsa, and the Cittapātali tree in Asurabhavana. 
In order that the Asuras should not enter Tāvatimsa, Sakka had five walls built 
around it, and these were guarded by <a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāgas</a>,
<a href="garudaa.htm" title="g/garudaa.htm">Supannas</a>, <a href="kumbhanda.htm" title="ku/kumbhanda.htm">Kumbhandas</a>, 
<a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkhas</a> and Cātummahārājika devas (J.i.201ff; also DhA.i.272f). The entrance to Tāvatimsa 
was by way of the Cittakūtadvārakotthaka, on either side of which statues of 
Indra (Indapatimā) kept guard (J.vi.97). The whole kingdom was ten thousand 
leagues in extent (DhA.i.273), and contained more than one thousand pāsādas 
(J.vi.279). The chief features of Tāvatimsa were its parks — the Phārusaka, 
Cittalatā, Missaka and Nandana — the Vejayantapāsāda, the Pāricchatta tree, the 
elephant-king Erāvana and the Assembly-hall Sudhammā (J.vi.278; MA.i.183; cp. 
Mtu.i.32). Mention is also made of a park called Nandā (J.i.204). Besides the 
Pāricchataka (or Pārijāta) flower, which is described as a Kovilāra (A.iv.117), 
the divine Kakkāru flower also grew in Tāvatimsa (J.iii.87). In the 
Cittalatāvana grows the Āsāvatī creeper, which blossoms once in a thousand years 
(J.iii.250f).</p>
<p>It is the custom of all Buddhas to spend 
the vassa following the performance of the 
<a href="yamaka_paatihaariya.htm" title="y/yamaka_paatihaariya.htm">Yamakapātihāriya</a>, in Tāvatimsa. 
Gotama Buddha went there to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother, born there as a 
devaputta. The distance of sixty-eight thousand leagues from the earth to 
Tāvatimsa he covered in three strides, placing his foot once on 
<a href="yugandhara.htm" title="y/yugandhara.htm">Yugandhara</a> and 
again on Sineru.</p>
<p>The Buddha spent three months in 
Tāvatimsa, preaching all the time, seated on Sakka’s throne, the 
Pandukambalasilāsana, at the foot of the Pāricchattaka tree. Eighty crores of 
devas attained to a knowledge of the truth. This was in the seventh year after 
his Enlightenment (J.iv.265; DhA.iii.216f; BuA. p.3). It seems to have been the 
frequent custom of ascetics, possessed of iddhi-power, to spend the afternoon in 
Tāvatimsa (E.g., Nārada, J.vi.392; and Kāladevala, J.i.54).</p>
<p><a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> paid numerous visits to 
Tāvatimsa, where he learnt from those dwelling there stories of their past 
deeds, that he might repeat them to men on earth for their edification (VvA. 
p.4).</p>
<p>The Jātaka Commentary mentions several 
human beings who were invited by Sakka, and who were conveyed to Tāvatimsa — 
e.g. Nimi, Guttila, Mandhātā and the queen Sīlavatī. Mandhātā reigned as 
co-ruler of Tāvatimsa during the life period of thirty-six Sakkas, sixty 
thousand years (J.ii.312). The inhabitants of Tāvatimsa are thirty-three in 
number, and they regularly meet in the Sudhammā Hall. (See 
<a href="sudhammaa.htm" title="s/sudhammaa.htm">Sudhammā</a> for 
details). A description of such an assembly is found in the Janavasabha Sutta. 
The Cātummahārājika Devas (q.v.) are present to act as guards. Inhabitants of 
other deva- and brahma-worlds seemed sometimes to have been present as guests — 
e.g. the Brahmā Sanankumāra, who came in the guise of Pañcasikha. From the 
description given in the sutta, all the inhabitants of Tāvatimsa seem to have 
been followers of the Buddha, deeply devoted to his teachings (D.ii.207ff). 
Their chief place of offering was the Cūlāmanicetiya, in which Sakka deposited 
the hair of Prince Siddhattha, cut off by him when he renounced the world and 
put on the garments of a recluse on the banks of the Nerañjarā (J.i.65). Later, 
Sakka deposited here also the eye-tooth of the Buddha, which Doha hid in his 
turban, hoping to keep it for himself (DA.ii.609; Bu.xxviii.6, 10).</p>
<p>The gods of Tāvatimsa sometimes come to 
earth to take part in human festivities (J.iii.87). Thus Sakka, Vissakamma and 
Mātali are mentioned as having visited the earth on various occasions. Mention 
is also made of goddesses from Tāvatimsa coming to bathe in the Anotatta and 
then spending the rest of the day on the Manosilātala (J.v.392).</p>
<p>The capital city of Tāvatimsa was 
Masakkasāra (Ibid., p.400). The average age of an inhabitant of Tāvatimsa is 
thirty million years, reckoned by human computation. Each day in Tāvatimsa is 
equal in time to one hundred years on earth (DhA.i.364). The gods of Tāvatimsa 
are most handsome; the Licchavis, among earth-dwellers, are compared to them 
(DhA.iii.280). The stature of some of the Tāvatimsa dwellers is three-quarters 
of a league; their undergarment is a robe of twelve leagues and their upper 
garment also a robe of twelve leagues. They live in mansions of gold, thirty 
leagues in extent (Ibid., p.8). The Commentaries (E.g., SA.i.23; AA.i.377) say 
that Tāvatimsa was named after Magha and his thirty-two companions, who were 
born there as a result of their good deeds in Macalagāma. Whether the number of 
the chief inhabitants of this world always remained at thirty-three, it is 
impossible to say, though some passages, e.g. in the Janavasabha Sutta, lead us 
to suppose so.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as in the case of Nandiya, 
who built the great monastery at Isipatana, a mansion would appear in Tāvatimsa, 
when an earth-dweller did a good deed capable of obtaining for him birth in this 
deva-world; but this mansion would remain unoccupied till his human life came to 
an end (DhA.iii.291). There were evidently no female devas among the 
Thirty-three. Both Māyā and Gopikā (q.v.) became devaputtas when born in 
Tāvatimsa. The women there were probably the attendants of the devas. (But see, 
e.g., Jālini and the various stories of VvA).</p>
<p>There were many others besides the 
Thirty-three who had their abode in Tāvatimsa. Each deva had numerous retinues 
of attendants, and the dove-footed (kaktgapādiniyo) nymphs (accharā) of 
Tāvatimsa are famous in literature for their delicate beauty. The sight of these 
made Nanda, when escorted by the Buddha to Tāvatimsa, renounce his love for 
Janapadakalyānī Nandā (J.ii.92; Ud.iii.2).</p>
<p>The people of Jambudīpa excelled the 
devas of Tāvatimsa in courage, mindfulness and piety (A.iv.396). Among the great 
achievements of Asadisakumāra was the shooting of an arrow as far as Tāvatimsa 
(J.ii.89).</p>
<p>Tāvatimsa was also known as Tidasa and 
Tidiva (q.v.).</p>
