<p><b>1. Subrahmā. </b>A Devaputta. He visits the Buddha at 
Veluvana and tells him that his heart is full of dismay. The Buddha replies that 
the only path out of sorrow is by way of wisdom, renunciation and restraint 
(S.i.53). According to the Commentary, (SA.i.88f.; DA.iii.750; MA.i.190f ), he 
was a devaputta of Tāvatimsa, and one day went to the Nandana Park with one 
thousand nymphs. Five hundred of them sat with him under the Pāricchattaka-tree, 
while the others climbed the tree, from which they threw garlands and sang 
songs. Suddenly all of them vanished and were born in Avīci. Subrahmā, 
discovering their destiny and investigating his own, finds that he has only 
seven days more to live. Full of grief, he seeks the Buddha for consolation. At 
the end of the Buddha’s discourse he becomes a sotāpanna.</p>

<p><b>2. Subrahmā.</b> A Pacceka Brahmā. He was a follower of 
the Buddha, and, after visiting him together with Suddhavāsa, he went on to 
another Brahmā, who was infatuated with his own importance. There, by a display 
of magic power, Subrahmā convinced him that he was far more powerful than the 
Brahmā, but declared that his own power was as nothing compared with that of the 
Buddha (S.i.146f). On another occasion,</p>
<p>Subrahmā visited the Buddha to declare the folly of 
Kokālika and of Katamoraka Tissa (S.i.148). Subrahmā was present at the 
preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta. D.ii.261.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Subrahmā.</b> A brahmin who will be the father of 
Metteyya Buddha. His wife will be Brahmavatī (DhSA.415; Vsm.434). He will be the 
chaplain of King Sankha (Anāgat.vs.96). According to the Mahāvamsa 
(Mhv.xxxii.82) he is identical with Kākavannatissa.</p>
