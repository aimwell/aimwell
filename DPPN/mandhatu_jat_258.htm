<p>The story of King Mandhātā. It was told to a backsliding 
monk who, while travelling in Sāvatthi for alms, saw an attractively dressed 
woman and fell in love with her. This was reported to the Buddha, who told him 
this story to show that lust could never be satisfied. At the end of the 
discourse the monk, with many others, became a sotāpanna.</p>
<p>DhA.iii.240 gives a different occasion for the story; but 
that, too, refers to a discontented monk.&nbsp; J.ii.310ff.</p>
