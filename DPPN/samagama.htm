<p><b>Sāmagāma. </b>A <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> village where the Sāmagāma Sutta 
(below) was preached (M.ii.243). There was a lotus pond in the village (A.iii.309). </p>
<p>The <a href="vedhanna.htm" title="vy/vedhanna.htm">Vedhaññā</a> probably lived there, because, according to the
<a href="pasadika_sutta.htm" title="pa/pasadika_sutta.htm">Pāsādika Sutta</a> 
(D.iii.117), the Buddha was in the mango grove of the Vedhañña Sākiyans when the 
news, as given in the Sāmagāma Sutta, of <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta’s</a> death, was brought 
to him.  </p>
<p>According to <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (MA.ii.829) the village was called Sāmagāma, 
Sāmakānam ussanattā.</p>

<p><b>1. Sāmagāma Sutta.</b> While the Buddha is at Sāmagāma, 
news is brought to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> by Cunda Samanuddesa of the death of 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a> at Pāvā, and of the division of his followers into two factions 
engaged in fighting each other. Ānanda  gives the news to the Buddha, who asks if 
there be any difference of opinion among monks regarding the Buddha’s teaching. 
“No,” answers Ānanda, but adds that such differences may arise after the 
Buddha’s death. The Buddha says that quarrels regarding rigours of regimen or of 
the Vinaya are of little concern. It is quarrels regarding the Path or the 
course of training that are really important. He then explains the six causes 
from which disputes grow, the four adjudications (adhikarana) regarding 
disputes, and the seven settlements of adjudication&nbsp;-&nbsp; by giving a 
summary verdict in the presence of the parties, a verdict of innocence, of past 
insanity; confession may be admitted; a chapter’s decision may be taken; there 
is also specific wickedness and there is covering up. Then there are six things 
which lead to conciliations: acts of love, words of love, sharing equally 
whatever gifts one receives, strict practice of virtue without flaw or blemish, 
and the holding of noble views which make for salvation (M.ii.243 51; cf. the
<a href="pasadika_sutta.htm" title="pa/pasadika_sutta.htm">Pāsadika Sutta</a>).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> adds (MA.ii.840) that, while in the
<a href="kosambiya.htm" title="ku/kosambiya.htm">Kosambiya 
Sutta</a> the Sotāpattimagga is called sammāditthi, in this sutta, Sotāpattiphala 
itself is so called.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2&nbsp; Sāmagāma Sutta.</b> The Buddha was once staying 
near the lotus pond at Sāmagāma and late at night is visited by a deva. After 
saluting the Buddha, he states that there are three things which lead to a 
monk’s failure:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>delight in worldly activity</li>
  <li>delight in talk</li>
  <li>delight in sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>So saying, he departs. The next day the Buddha relates to the monks the Deva’s 
statement and adds three other things which lead to failure: </p>
<ul>
  <li>delight in company</li>
  <li>evil speaking</li>
  <li>friendship with bad men. A.iii.309f.</li>
</ul>
