  <h2>Bhīma</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A sage of old who possessed the five abhiññā and great 
iddhi-powers. </p>
<p>The Bodhisatta, at that time, was a learned brahmin, and, 
having met Bhīma, said that he was a sensualist (kāma-bhogī), 
and his disciples agreed with him. It was for this reason the Buddha and five 
hundred monks suffered calumny at the hands of Sundarikā. Ap.i.299; UdA.264.</p>
