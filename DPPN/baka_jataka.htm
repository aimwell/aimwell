<p>A crane, living near a pond, where the water dried up in 
summer, offered to carry the fish to a distant pond where water was plentiful. 
The fish, very suspicious, sent one of their numbers with the crane to verify 
his words, and when he returned with a favourable report, they accepted the 
crane’s offer. One by one the fish were carried off and eaten by the crane, till 
only a crab was left. The wily crab agreed to go too, but he clung round the 
crane’s neck while being carried along and cut off his head with his pincers 
when he discovered the crane’s intentions.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk of Jetavana who was a clever robe maker. He could make robes of rags, which 
he dyed so skilfully that they looked new and costly. Visiting monks, on seeing 
them, would exchange their new robes for his old ones and not discover their 
folly till later. A similar robe maker lived in a hamlet at some distance from 
Jetavana, who, hearing of the Jetavana monk succeeded in cheating him. The monk 
was the crane and the hamlet dweller the crab of the story. J.i.220 ff.</p>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a large shoal of 
fish. A crane, who wished to eat them, stood on the bank of the pond with 
outstretched wings, gazing vacantly into space. The fish were impressed by his 
pious demeanour, but were warned against him by the Bodhisatta. </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a hypocrite who is 
identified with the crane. J.ii.233f.</p>
