<p>1. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No. 98).-The 
Bodhisatta was once a merchant named Pandita and entered into partnership with a 
dishonest man, Atipandita. When the time came for dividing the profits the 
latter claimed a larger share, for he, as his name showed, was the “brains” of 
the business. To settle the dispute he hid his father in a hollow tree, and 
feigning to consult a Tree-sprite, referred the matter to the Tree. Pandita 
suspecting the ruse, lighted a fire at the foot of the tree and thus exposed the 
cheat.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
cheating merchant of Sāvatthi, who is identified with Atipandita. He tried to 
rob his honest partner, always putting off his claims, in the hope that he would 
die from the hardships suffered in a long journey they had undertaken for trade. 
J.i.404f</p>

<p>2. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.218).-A 
villager once deposited five hundred ploughshares with a friend in the town, but 
when he came to claim them, he was told that they had been eaten by mice, and 
was shown the dung the mice had left behind. Some time later the villager took 
his friend’s son to bathe, hid him in a house, and reported to the townsman that 
the boy had been carried off by a hawk. When he was taken before the judge, who 
was the Bodhisatta, he protested that in a place where mice ate ploughshares a 
hawk could easily carry off a boy. The Bodhisatta settled their dispute 
(J.ii.181ff).</p>
<p>The introductory story is similar to 
that of No.1 above.&nbsp; </p>
