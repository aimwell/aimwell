<h4>1. Rādha Jātaka (No. 145)</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a parrot, named Potthapāda, and his brother 
was Rādha. They were brought up by a brahmin of Kāsī. When the brahmin was away, 
his wife admitted men to the house and her husband set the birds to watch. Rādha 
wished to admonish her, but his brother said it was useless and they must await 
the brahmin’s return. Having told him what had happened, the two parrots flew 
away, saying they could not live there any longer.</p>
<p>Rādha is identified with Ānanda (J.i.495f). The introductory story is 
identical with that of the Indriya Jātaka (No. 423).</p>

<h4>2. Rādha Jātaka (No. 198)</h4>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a parrot, brother to Potthapāda. They were 
brought up by a brahmin in Benares. When the brahmin went away, he told the 
birds to watch his wife and report to him any misconduct. But Potthapāda, in 
spite of his brother’s warning, admonished the woman, who, in a rage, while 
pretending to fondle him, wrung his neck and threw him into the fire. When the 
brahmin returned, Rādha said he did not wish to share his brother’s fate, and 
flew away.</p>
<p>Potthapāda is identified with Ānanda. The story was told in reference to a 
monk who became a backslider owing to a woman. J.ii.132ff.; cf. the Kālabāhu 
Jātaka.</p>
