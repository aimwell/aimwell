<p>A locality in the old Mahānāga garden, on the banks of the 
Mahāvālukagangā. It was there that the Buddha hovered in the air on his first 
visit to Ceylon, in order to frighten the Yakkhas. Later, Mahāsumana built there 
a shrine seven cubits in diameter, all of sapphire, and containing the hair 
given to him by the Buddha. After the Buddha’s death, Sarabhū, a disciple of 
Sāriputta, brought there the collar bone of the Buddha, which he deposited in 
the thūpa, increasing the height of the thūpa to twelve cubits. Uddhacūlābhaya 
raised it to thirty cubits, while Dutthagāmanī, dwelling there during his 
campaign against the Damila Chatta, increased it to eighty cubits (Mhv.i.24, 
33ff.; xxv.7; Cv. Trs.i.154, n.3). Vohārika Tissa erected a parasol over the 
thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.34). Attached to the thūpa was a vihāra, near which lived the 
three Lambakannas, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.58).</p>
<p>In later times, Sena II. gave maintenance villages to the 
vihāra (Cv.li.74), as did also Kassapa IV. (Cv.lii.14). Vijayabāhu I. found the 
vihāra in a bad state of decay and had it restored, (Cv.lx.59) while 
Parakkamabāhu VI. carried out repairs to the thūpa (Cv.xci.29). King Vīravikamma 
went from his capital to Mahiyangana, a distance of seven gāvutas on foot, and 
held a great festival in honour of the thūpa (Cv.xcii.17). King Narindasīha is 
mentioned as having visited Mahiyangana three times&nbsp;&nbsp; once alone and 
twice with his army&nbsp;&nbsp; and as having held magnificent festivals in its 
honour (Cv.xcvii.27ff). Vijayarājasīha held a festival there (Cv.xcviii.85), as 
did Kittisirirājasīha, who made a pilgrimage to the spot (Cv.xcix.38); he also 
made arrangements for travelers from Siam to Ceylon to visit the spot and hold 
celebrations there (Cv.c.125ff). Rājasīha II. was born in Mahiyangana, while his 
parents were staying there for protection from their enemies. Cv.xcv.12.</p>
