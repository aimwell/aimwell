<p><b>1. Mahātittha.</b> A brahmin village in Magadha, the 
birthplace of <a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā-Kassapa</a>. ThagA.ii.141; AA.i.99; SA.ii.143.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahātittha.</b> The name of Mahāmeghavana in the 
time of Kakusandha Buddha. It was presented to the Buddha by king Abhaya, who 
planted in it a branch of the Bodhi tree brought by Rucānandā. Mhv.xv. 58, 73f., 
83.</p>

<h4>3. Mahātittha</h4>
<p>A landing place on the west coast of Ceylon. The wives 
brought from Madhurā for Vijaya and his companions landed there, hence the name 
(Mhv.vii.58; see Mhv.Trs.60, n.1). There landed also in later times Bhalluka, 
from South India (Mhv.xxv.79), the Damilas and others who invaded Ceylon 
(Mhv.xxxiii.39; Cv.lviii.14; Cv.xi.37; Cv.lxxxviii.63). It was probably the 
chief port f or vessels plying between South India and Ceylon. Thus, it was from 
there that Sakkasenāpati embarked for the Pandu country (Cv.lii.73), and there 
that the Pandu king landed from Cola (Cv.liii.5). The expeditionary force of 
Vijayabāhu I. embarked there for Cola (Cv.lx.34), as did the forces of 
Parakkamabāhu I. under Lankāpura (Cv.lxxvi.83). </p>
<p>It was a convenient place for preparations to be made 
before advancing on the capital, or merely journeying thither (thus 
Cv.lxviii.81; Cv.li.28). It was a place of strategic importance, and when Māgha 
and Jayabāhu invaded Ceylon, they set up fortifications there. Cv.lxxxiii.16.</p>
