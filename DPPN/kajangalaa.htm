<p>A nun who lived in Kajangala. Once when 
the Buddha was residing in the Veluvana there, the inhabitants of the village 
went to her and asked her to explain in detail what the Buddha had taught them 
in brief. This she did, and when the matter was reported to the Buddha, he 
praised her very highly (A.v.54ff). The exposition given by her is quoted in the 
Khuddakap훮tha Commentary (pp.80, 83, 85). Her story is given in detail in the 
Avad훮nasataka (ii.41ff).</p>
