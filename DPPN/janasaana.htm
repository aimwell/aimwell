<p>An Ājīvaka. He it was who predicted the 
glory of Asoka by explaining the prenatal desires of his mother. The queen 
promised him great honour if his predictions should prove true. Later, when 
Asoka became king and heard the story, he sent a golden palanquin to fetch 
Janasāna to the palace. On the way, Janasāna visited the Vattaniya hermitage 
where lived Assagutta, and having heard the latter talk of āyatana, his earlier 
kamma asserted itself and he became a monk, attaining arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a 
python who died while listening to some monks reciting a chapter on the āyatanas.
