  <h2>Munika Jātaka (No.30)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once an ox, called Mahālohita, in a 
householder’s family, where his brother Cullalohita and he did all the work. 
When their master’s daughter was about to be married, a pig, named Munika, was 
brought and fattened on all kinds of luxuries. Cullalohita protested to his 
brother, but the latter warned him of Munika’s fate. And soon after Munika was 
killed and eaten.</p>
<p>The origin of the story is the same as that of the Culla 
Nāradakassapa Jātaka. The passion<span lang="en-us">-tost 
monk was Munika, and Ānanda the younger ox. J.i.196ff.</p>
