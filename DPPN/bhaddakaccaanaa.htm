<p>The youngest of the children of <a href="pandu.htm" title="pa/pandu.htm">Pandu</a>, the 
Sākiyan. She was 
so beautiful that seven kings begged to be allowed to marry her. Her father, 
unable to decide between her suitors, put her in a boat with thirty two 
companions and launched the boat upon the Ganges. The boat arrived in the course 
of the following day at Gonagāmaka in Ceylon, where the women landed, dressed as 
nuns. In due course they came to Upatissagāma, where the king, Panduvāsudeva, 
warned by soothsayers, awaited their arrival and married Bhaddakaccānā. 
</p>
<p>Later, six of her brothers came to Ceylon and settled in 
different parts; the brothers were Rāma, Uruvela, Anurādha, Vijita, Dīghāyu and 
Rohana. The seventh brother, Gāmani, stayed at home.</p>
<p>Bhaddakaccānā had ten children, the eldest being Abhaya 
and the youngest Ummādacittā. Mhv.viii.18ff.; ix. 1, 9 f.; Dpv.x.1ff.</p>
