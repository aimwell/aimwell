<p>A horse belonging to King Kutakanna-Tissa. 
Once the king, on his way from Anurādhapura to Cetiyapabbata, came to the 
Kadamba river and found that his horse would not cross it. When the trainer was 
blamed, he explained that the horse did not wish to have his tail wet, in case 
the king’s dress should be spoilt. The king held up the horse’s tail, and he 
immediately crossed the stream (MA.ii.653f).</p>
<p>The story was told to illustrate the 
good qualities of a well-trained horse.</p>
