<h4>1. Piyadassī</h4>
<p>The thirteenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in 
Sudhañña (Sudassana) and his mother was Sucandā (Candā). He was called Piyadassī 
because he showed many pleasing miracles. For nine thousand years he lived as a 
layman in three palaces: Sunimala Vimala and Giriguhā (Giribrahā). His wife was 
Vimalā and his son Kañcanavela (Kañcana). He left home in a chariot and 
practised austerities for six months. He was given milk rice by Vasabha’s 
daughter and grass for his seat by the Ajīvaka Sujāta. His, bodhi was a Kakudha 
tree. Among his converts were the deva king Sudassana and the elephant Donamukha. 
A monk named Sona conspired with Prince Mahāpaduma to kill the Buddha, Donamukha 
being the elephant they used in their unsuccessful plot. cp. Nālāgiri.</p>
<p>Piyadassī’s chief disciples were Pālita and Sabbadassī 
among monks and Sujātā and Dhammadinnā among nuns, his constant attendant being 
Sobhita. Sannaka and Dhammika were his chief lay patrons among men, and Visākhi 
and Dhammadinnā among women. He lived for ninety thousand years and died at 
Assatthārāma, his thūpa being three leagues in height.  </p>
<p>The Bodhisatta of that 
time was a brahmin named Kassapa, and he built a monastery for the Buddha at a 
cost of one hundred thousand crores. Bu.xiv.1ff.; BuA.172ff.; J.i.38f., etc.</p>
