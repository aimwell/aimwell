<p><b>1. Anulā.</b>-Daughter of Mutasiva, King of 
Ceylon, and wife of Mahānāga, who was brother and sub-king to Devānampiya-Tissa. 
With five hundred other women she heard Mahinda preach the Petavatthu, the 
Vimānavatthu and the Sacca Samyutta, and together with the others became a 
Stream-enterer (Mhv.xiv.56-7; Dpv.xi.8; xii.82). Later, hearing the sermon 
preached by Mahinda in the Mahāmeghavana, she, with others, became a Sakadāgāmī, 
and expressed to the king their wish to receive ordination. It was to enable 
these to be ordained that Sanghamittā was sent for (Mhv.xv.18-19; Sp.i.90ff.; 
Dpv.xv.73ff). Until the arrival of Sanghamittā, Anulā and her companions 
observed the ten precepts and lived in the Upāsikā Vihāra. Mhv.xviii.9-12. The 
Tikā (p.388) says they took on the ekāsanikanga vow as well; see also Mbv. 
pp.121, 144, 167.</p>
<p>After her ordination Anulā became an 
arahant (Mhv.xix.65; xvi.41) and was the first woman arahant in Ceylon.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Anulā.</b>-Widow of Khallātanāga, King of 
Ceylon, and later wife of Vattagāmani (Mhv.xxxiii.35, 36). When Vattagāmani had 
to flee from his enemies, she was the only one of his wives whom he took with 
him, because she was with child (Mhv.xxxiii.45). Later, when they were hiding in 
Malaya, under the protection of Tanasiva, Anulā quarrelled with the wife of 
Tanasiva and, as a result, Vattagāmani killed him. (Mhv.xxxiii.62ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Anulā.</b>-Wife of Coranāga and Queen of 
Ceylon for four months (in A.D. 12-16). She was a lewd woman and killed her 
husband that she might marry Mahācūla’s son, Tissa. She soon got tired of him 
and poisoned him. Then, in succession, she had as husbands Siva, a palace guard; 
Vatuka, a Tamil carpenter; Tissa, a woodcarrier; the Damila Niliya, a palace 
priest — all of whom she removed by poisoning. The last one she killed because 
she wished to live indiscriminately with thirty-two palace guards.</p>
<p>In the end she was killed by 
Kutakannatissa (Mhv.xxxiv.16-34; Dpv.xix.50ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Anulā.</b>-The chief woman-disciple of 
Kassapa Buddha. Bu.xxv.40; J.i.43.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Anulā.</b>-Daughter of Cūlasetthi of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. She lived with her husband in Andhakavinda, and after her father’s 
death she fed brahmins in his name, but this pious act was of no benefit to him 
(PvA.105ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Anulā.</b>-One of the chief 
women-supporters of Mangala Buddha (Bu.iv.25).</p>
