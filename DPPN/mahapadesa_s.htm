<p>Preached at the Ānanda cetiya in 
<a href="bhogagamanagara.htm" title="b/bhogagamanagara.htm">Bhoganagara</a>.  </p>
<p>The Buddha 
tells the monks of the four mahāpadesā to be respected by them. If a monks says 
he has a certain teaching direct from the Buddha himself, his statement should 
be compared with the rest of the Vinaya and Dhamma; if these do not agree, it 
should be rejected; if they do, accepted.  </p>
<p>The same applies to that which is said 
to have been learnt from a group of monks led by a Thera from a body of senior 
monks residing in a certain place, or from a single senior monk, proficient in 
the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mātikā. A.ii.167ff.; the sutta is incorporated 
in the <a href="mahaparinibbana_s.htm" title="maha/mahaparinibbana_s.htm">Mahāparinibbāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.123ff).</p>
