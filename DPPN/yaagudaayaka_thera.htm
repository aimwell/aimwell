<p>An arahant. Thirty thousand kappas ago, while on his way 
home laden with gifts, he found the river impassable and took his evening meal 
at a monastery. There he was pleased with the demeanour of the monks and gave 
them a meal of gruel with five savouries (? pañcanna yāgu). After death, he was 
born in Tāvatimsa, and was king of gods thirty three times and king of men 
thirty times. Ap.ii.375f.</p>
