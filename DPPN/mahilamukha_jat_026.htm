  <h2>Mahilāmukha Jātaka (No. 26)</h2>

<p>Brahmadatta, king of Benares, owned a state elephant, 
called Mahilāmukha, who was gentle and good. One day thieves sat down outside 
his stable and started talking of their plans for robbery, and murder. Several 
days in succession this happened, until at last, by dint of listening to them, 
Mahilāmukha became cruel and began to kill his keepers. The king sent his 
minister, the Bodhisatta, to investigate the matter. He discovered what had 
happened, and made good men sit outside the stables who talked of various 
virtues. The elephant regained his former goodness and gentleness.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who was 
persuaded by a friend to eat at the monastery of Gayāsīsa, built for Devadatta 
by Ajātuattu. The monk would steal off there at the hour of the meal and then 
return to Veluvana. After some time his guilty secret was discovered, and he was 
admonished by the Buddha. He is identified with Mahilāmukha and the king with 
Ānanda. J.i.185 8; see also Giridanta and Manoja Jātakas.</p>
<p>Mahisa Jātaka (No. 278). The Bodhisatta, was born once as 
a buffalo in Himavā. One day, as he stood under a tree, a monkey fouled him, and 
taking hold of his horn pulled him about. But the buffalo showed no resentment. 
This happened several times, and on being asked by the spirit of the tree why he 
endured it, the buffalo answered that it was by virtue of his goodness. Later 
the monkey tried his games on another buffalo, who killed him.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monkey who, in the 
same way, fouled an elephant of Sāvatthi and escaped unhurt owing to the 
patience of the elephant. On another day a fierce elephant came from the stables 
and the monkey was trampled to death. J.i.385 7.</p>
