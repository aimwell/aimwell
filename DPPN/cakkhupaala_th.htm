  <h2>Cakkhupāla Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An arahant. He was the son of a 
landowner, Mahā Suvanna of Sāvatthi, and was called Mahā-Pāla (major Pāla), his 
brother being Culla-Pāla. The boys were called Pāla on account of being born 
through the favour of a tree deity.  </p>
<p>Mahā-Pāla heard the Buddha preach at 
Jetavana and entered the Order. After five years of novitiate he went with sixty 
others to a woodland spot to meditate. There he fell a victim to ophthalmia and 
was prescribed for by a doctor; but he neglected his eyes, devoting his whole 
time to the duties of recluse ship. He became an arahant but lost the sight of 
his eyes, hence his name. Later, Cakkhupāla’s colleagues returned to Sāvatthi 
and, at his own request, Cakkhupāla’s brother sent his nephew Pālita, ordained 
as a monk, to fetch him. On the way through the forest, Pālita was attracted by 
the song of a woodcutter’s wife and, bidding his uncle wait, went and sinned 
with her. When Cakkhupāla, by questioning the novice, learnt of this, he refused 
to be accompanied by him, even though he should die on the way. Sakka’s throne 
was heated, and he led the Elder safely to Sāvatthi, where he was looked after 
by his brother to the end of his days (Thag.95; ThagA.i.195f).  </p>
<p>It is said that 
in a previous birth he had been a physician, and because a woman, whose disease 
of the eye he had cured, tried to cheat him out of his promised reward, he gave 
her a drug which completely ruined her eyes. DhA.i.15ff, where several details 
are given regarding Cakkhupāla which are not mentioned here.</p>
