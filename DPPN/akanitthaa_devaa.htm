  <h2>Akanitthā devā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of devas, living in the highest 
of the five Suddhāvasā (Pure Mansions) (D.iii.237).  </p>
<p>In the <a href="mahapadana_s.htm" title="maha/mahapadana_s.htm">Mahāpadāna Sutta</a> (D.ii.52f) 
the Buddha mentions that he visited their abode and conversed with beings who 
were born there as a result of the holy lives they had lived under various 
Buddhas. </p>
<p>In the <a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a> (D.ii.286) 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> 
speaks of them as the highest devas, and expresses his satisfaction that he, 
too, will be born among them in his last life.  </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says they are so 
called because of their supremacy in virtue and in happiness, and because there 
are no juniors among them (sabbeh'eva sagunehi ca bhavasampattiyā ca jetthā 
n'atth'ettha kanitthāti akanitthā). DA.ii.480. VbhA.521 [āyunā ca paññaya ca 
Akanitthā jetthakā sabba-devehi panītatarā devā (=DA.iii.739)].</p>
<p>In the <a href="visuddhi_magga.htm" title="vy/visuddhi_magga.htm">Visuddhi Magga</a> (p. 634) their 
world is spoken of as a Brahma loka where Anāgāmīs are born and enter complete 
Nibbāna (p. 710) (also ItA.40; DA.iii.740). The duration of life among these 
devas is 16,000 Kalpas (Kvu.207). Sometimes Anāgāmī 
are born among the Avihā devas and finish their existence, in a subsequent 
birth, among the Akanitthās. These are called “Uddhamsotā.” (DhA.iii.289f.; see 
also S.v.201).  </p>
<p>The Akanittha-bhavana is the upper limit of the rūpvacara-bhūmi 
(Ps.i.84); it is also spoken of as the highest point of the universe, 
<a href="aviici.htm" title="ay/aviici.htm">Avīci</a> being the lowest. Thus the quarrel among the 
<a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a> monks spread even up to the Akanitthā devā (J.iii.487), as did the shouts of the assembly at the severing of 
the branch of the Bodhi tree (Mbv. 150-1; see also Mil. 284).</p>
