<p>Preached at the <a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">Migāramātupāsāda</a> on a full moon night. A 
monk asks the Buddha a series of questions regarding the five <i>upādānakkhandhā</a></i>, their origin, their definition, and also as to how notions of self come about (<i>sakkāyaditthi</i>).  The Buddha answers him, and shows how deliverance can be attained by realization 
that there is no self in any <i>khandha</i>. </p>
<p>It is said that sixty monks, who heard the sutta, became 
arahants. M.iii.15<span lang="en-us">-20.</p>
