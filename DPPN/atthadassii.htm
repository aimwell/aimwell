<p>1. Atthadassī.-The fourteenth of the 
twenty-four Buddhas. He was born in Sobhana in the Sucindhanu pleasaunce, his 
parents being Sāgara and Sudassanā (Bu.xv.; BuA.178ff). He was so called because 
at his birth people recovered long-buried treasures. His wife was Visākhā and 
his son Sena (Sela according to the Buddhavamsa Commentary). He lived for 10,000 
years as a householder in three palaces — Amaragiri, Suragiri and Girivāhana. He 
left home on a horse called Sudassana. His penance lasted eight months, and his 
meal of milk-rice was given by a nāga woman, Sucindharā. A nāga, Dhammaruci, 
gave him the grass which he spread at the foot of the campaka tree, where he 
reached Enlightenment. His first sermon was preached in the Anomā-park near 
Anoma. His chief disciples were Santa, the king’s son, and Upasanta, son of the 
chaplain of Sucandaka. His chief women disciples were Dhammā and Sudhammā. 
Abhaya was his attendant, and his patrons were Nakula and Nisabha among the 
laymen, and Makilā and Sunandā among the lay-women. The Bodhisatta was a jatila, 
Susīma of Campaka, and he offered the Buddha a canopy of flowers brought from 
the deva-world. Atthadassī died at the age of 100,000 years at Anomārāma in 
Anupama and his relics were scattered in various places. He appeared in the 
Mandakappa, in the company of two others, Piyadassī and Dhammadassī. J.i.39.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Atthadassī. A Thera in Ceylon who, in 
company with two others, Buddhamitta and Buddhadeva, asked that the 
Jātakatthakatha be written (J.i.1; Gv.68). He was probably an incumbent of the 
Mahāvihara in Anurādhapura. See Pāli Lit. of Ceylon, 125.</p>

<p>3. Atthadassī.-One of the mythological 
kings of Kapilavatthu. Dip.iii.41.</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Atthadassī.-A Thera in Ceylon, 
supposed by some to be the author of the Bhesajjamañjūsā and to have been the 
head of the Pañca-mūla parivena. Pāli Lit. of Ceylon, 215.</p>
