  <h2>Mahāsuññatā Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preached at Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu. The Buddha was 
staying in the cell erected by Kālakhemaka, and near by, in the cell erected by 
Ghatāya, Ānanda, with many monks, was making robes. The Buddha knew from the 
number of pallets outside the cells of Kālakhemaka that many monks were in 
residence there. He therefore addressed Ānanda, telling him of the joys of 
tranquility and solitude. A monk should dwell apart and concentrate his heart 
internally and thus develop the four jhānas. He then knows that, whatever his 
posture, he will be free from evil dispositions; his speech will be free from 
faults, his thoughts pure. A monk should always search his heart to discover if 
he has any traffic with pleasures of sense. A disciple should follow his 
master’s footsteps, not in order to obtain interpretations of canonical law, but 
solely to hear words which conduce to passionless ness, illumination, Nibbāna 
(M.iii.109 18).</p>
<p>The sutta is also called Ganabheda, because it tends to 
break up crowds. Once, in the Vālikapitthi vihāra, Abhidhammika Abhaya recited 
this sutta with several others, and, understanding its import, dwelt apart and 
attained arahantship during the rains. MA.ii.907.</p>
