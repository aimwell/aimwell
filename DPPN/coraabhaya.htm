<p>A brigand, who set up his stronghold 
between Anurādhapura and Cetiyagiri. He once came with his followers to plunder 
Cetiyagiri monastery, but Dīghabhānaka-Abhaya Thera (q.v. ), hearing of his 
intentions, gave orders that the robbers should be given a meal of the monastery 
food. This so pleased Corābhaya that from that time he undertook to provide safe 
passage for all pilgrims to Cetiyagiri (Sp.ii.474).</p>
<p>Corābhaya is generally classed with 
Coranāga and, both are said to have been born after death in Lokantarikaniraya 
with bodies three gāvutas in height. AA.ii.532; MA.ii.920; DA.ii.433.</p>
