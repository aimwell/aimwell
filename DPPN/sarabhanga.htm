<p><b>1. Sarabhanga. </b>A Pacceka Buddha. M.iii.70. 
ApA.i.107.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sarabhanga Thera.</b> He belonged to a brahmin 
family of Rājagaha, and was given a name according to the family traditions. 
When he grew up, he became an ascetic, and made a hut for himself of reed 
stalks, which he had broken off&nbsp;&nbsp; hence his name, Sarabhanga (Reed 
plucker). The Buddha saw in him the conditions of arahantship, and went to him 
and taught the Dhamma. He listened and joined the Order, attaining arahantship 
in due course. He continued to live in his hut till it decayed and crumbled 
away, and, when asked why he did not repair it he answered that he bad looked 
after it during his ascetic practices, but that now he had no time for such 
things. He then declared his aññā in a series of verses. ThagA.i.480 f. These 
verses are found in Thag.vs.487 93.</p>
