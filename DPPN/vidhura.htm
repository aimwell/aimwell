<p><b>1. Vidhura.</b> A brahmin, chaplain of the king of 
Benares. For details see the <a href="sambhava_jat_515.htm" title="sa/sambhava_jat_515.htm">Sambhava Jātaka</a>. He is identified with Mahā Kassapa 
(J.v.67). Vidhura’s son was Bhadrakāra. J.v.60.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vidhura.</b> The Bodhisatta born as the minister of 
Dhanañjaya-Korabba. See the <a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm" title="vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545.htm">Vidhurapandita Jātaka</a>.  </p>
<p>His father was the brahmin <a href="canda.htm" title="c/canda.htm">Canda</a> (J.vi.262), and he owned three palaces: Koñca, Mayūra and Piyaketa 
(J.vi.289). Anujjā was his wife and Cetā his daughter in law; among his sons was 
<a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> (J.vi.290). </p>
<p>In one place (J.vi.301) he is spoken of as having one 
thousand wives and seven hundred female slaves.</p>
<p>The Vidhurapandita of the 
<a href="dhuumakaari_jat_413.htm" title="d/dhuumakaari_jat_413.htm">Dhūmakāri Jātaka</a> is 
probably identical with the above, as also the minister of the same name in the
<a href="dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm" title="d/dasabraahmana_jat_495.htm">Dasabrāhmana Jātaka</a>. The latter contains a long discussion between Vidhūra and the Korabba king regarding the qualities of a true brahmin.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vidhura. </b>The Milinda-Pañha (p.202) refers to a 
birth of the Bodhisatta in which he was a wise man (pandita) named Vidhura. At 
that time Devadatta, although a jackal, brought the kings of all Jambudīpa under 
his sway. The reference is evidently to the 
<a href="sabbadatha_jat_241.htm" title="sa/sabbadatha_jat_241.htm">Sabbadātha Jātaka</a> (No. 241), but 
there the Bodhisatta’s name is not given.</p>
