<p>Once, the Bodhisatta, after studying at Takkasilā, became 
an ascetic in the Himālaya, visited Uttarapañcāla, and resided in the garden of 
the Pañcāla king. The king saw him begging for alms, invited him into the palace 
and, having shown him great honour, asked him to stay in the park. When the time 
came for the Bodhisatta to return to the Himālaya, he wished for a pair of 
single soled shoes and a leaf parasol. But for twelve years he could not summon 
up enough courage to ask the king for these things! He could only get as far as 
telling the king he had a favour to ask, and then his heart failed him, for, he 
said to himself, it made a man weep to have to ask and it made a man weep to 
have to refuse. In the end the king noticed his discomfiture and offered him all 
his possessions; but the ascetic would take only the shoes and the parasol, and, 
with these, he left for the Himālaya. </p>
<p>The king is identified with Ānanda. J.iii.78ff.</p>
