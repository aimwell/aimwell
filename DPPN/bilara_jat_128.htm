<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a big rat, leader of a 
troop of rats. A roving jackal, wishing to eat them, took up his stand near 
their home, poised on one leg, feigning great holiness. Impressed by his 
austerities, the Bodhisatta and his troop worshipped him, and each day the 
jackal ate the rat, which was hindmost when they turned to leave him. Seeing 
their number diminish, the Bodhisatta suspected the reason, and one day he 
himself came last, behind the others. When the jackal pounced on him, he sprang 
at his throat and killed him, the other rats eating the body.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who was a 
hypocrite. J.i.460f.</p>
