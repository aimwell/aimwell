  <p>A merchant of Mahātitthapattana. He was away from home for three years, and the king’s 
  minister, Siva, wishing to possess his wife, paid a necromancer to send a 
  demon to kill Nandi.  
  <p>&nbsp;<p>The demon went to the ship, but on Nandi’s advice the 
  crew sought the Three Refuges, and the demon fled. Baulked of his prey, the 
  demon killed both the necromancer and Siva. Ras.ii.139f.<hr>
