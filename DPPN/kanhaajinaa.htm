  <h2>Kanhājinā</h2>

</ul>
<p>Daughter of Vessantara and Maddī. She 
was so called because, at birth, she was laid on a black skin (J.vi.487). When 
Vessantara retired to the forest, his wife and children accompanied him to 
Vankagiri. Later, both Kanhājinā and her brother Jāli were given to Jūjaka as 
slaves and were ill-treated by him. For sixty leagues they travelled with him, 
led and guarded by the gods, till they came to the court of their grandfather 
Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and there they were released, Kanhājinā’s price being one 
hundred elephants, one hundred male and female slaves, etc. The children 
afterwards rejoined their parents and lived happily at the court (J.vi.513ff).</p>
<p>Kanhājinā is identified with Uppalavannā 
(J.vi.593). In the verses she is sometimes called Kanhā (E.g., 546, 548, 553).</p>
<p>Vessantara’s gift of his children is 
considered the greatest of his gifts. E.g., Milinda, 117, 275, 284; Cyp.p.80; 
DhA.i.406; AA.i.64.</p>
