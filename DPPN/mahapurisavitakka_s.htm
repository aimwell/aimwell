<p>The books say (E.g., DhA.i.117) that <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> became an 
arahant after listening to this sutta. There is no sutta of this name, but the 
reference is evidently to the <a href="anuruddha_s_samy.htm#5" title="ay/anuruddha_s_samy.htm#5">Anuruddha Sutta</a> (A.iv.227ff), which the 
Buddha preached to Anuruddha who was then dwelling among the Cetis in 
<a href="pacinavamsamigadaya.htm" title="pa/pacinavamsamigadaya.htm">Pācīnavamsamigadāya</a>.  </p>
<p>Anuruddha was meditating on the seven purisa-vitakkā, and 
the Buddha appeared before him and taught him the eighth

precise and for one who delights in exactness, not for the diffuse or for him 
who delights in diffuseness. The Buddha later addresses the monks of 
<a href="sumsumaaragiri.htm" title="s/sumsumaaragiri.htm">Sumsumāragiri</a> and tells them of the eight mahā-purisa-vitakkā.</p>
