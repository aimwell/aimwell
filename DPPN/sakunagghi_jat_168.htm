</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a quail and was seized one day by 
a falcon. The quail lamented, saying that if he had remained in the feeding 
ground of his own people he would not have suffered thus. The falcon, hearing 
this, let him go, saying that he could catch him, no matter where he was. The 
quail flew back and perched on an immense clod, whence he called to the falcon. 
The falcon swooped down, but the quail just turned over, and the falcon was 
dashed to pieces against the clod. J.ii.58f.</p>
<p>The J훮taka was related on the occasion of the preaching of 
the Sakunov훮da Sutta (q.v.).</p>
