<p>A brahmin. Before the appearance of the 
Buddha in the world, Āmagandha became an ascetic and lived in the region of the 
Himālaya with five hundred pupils. They ate neither fish nor flesh. Every year 
they came down from their hermitage in search of salt and vinegar, and the 
inhabitants of a village near by received them with great honour and showed them 
every hospitality for four months.</p>
<p>Then one day the Buddha, with his monks, 
visited the same village, and the people having listened to his preaching became 
his followers. That year when Āmagandha and his disciples went as usual to the 
village, the householders did not show towards them the same enthusiasm as 
heretofore. The brahmin, enquiring what had happened, was full of excitement on 
hearing that the Buddha had been born, and wished to know if he ate “āmagandha,” 
by which he meant fish or flesh. He was greatly disappointed on learning that 
the Buddha did not forbid the eating of āmagandha, but, desiring to hear about 
it from the Buddha himself, he sought him at Jetavana. The Buddha told him that 
āmagandha was not really fish or flesh, but that it referred to evil actions, 
and that he who wished to avoid it should abstain from evil deeds of every kind. 
The same question had been put to the Buddha Kassapa by an ascetic named Tissa, 
who later became his chief disciple. In giving an account of the conversation 
between Kassapa Buddha and Tissa, the Buddha preached to Āmagandha the Āmagandha 
Sutta. The Brahmin and his followers entered the Order and in a few days became 
arahants. Sn., pp.42-5; SnA.i.278ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Āmagandha Sutta.</b>-The conversation 
between the Buddha and the brabmin Āmagandha mentioned above (Sn.42ff). 
According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.280ff) this was merely a reproduction of the 
conversation of the Buddha Kassapa with the ascetic Tissa, who later became his 
chief disciple.</p>
<p>The sutta is particularly interesting as 
being one of the few passages in which sayings of the previous Buddhas are 
recorded. The Buddha’s view is put forward as being identical with that which 
had been enunciated long ago, with the intended implication that it was a 
self-evident proposition accepted by all the wise.</p>
