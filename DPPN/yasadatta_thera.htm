  <h2>Yasadatta Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a family of <a href="mallaa.htm" title="ma/mallaa.htm">Malla</a> chieftains and was 
educated at <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, where he attained great proficiency. Later, while 
journeying in the company of <a href="sabhiya.htm" title="sa/sabhiya.htm">Sabhiya</a>, he came to 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, where he was present 
at the discussion between Sabhiya and the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. It was his purpose to try and 
discover flaws in the Buddha’s argument. The Buddha knew what was in his mind, 
and at the end of the <a href="sabhiya.htm" title="sa/sabhiya.htm">Sabhiya Sutta</a> admonished him in five verses (Thag.360 4). Yasadatta was greatly moved and entered the Order, winning arahantship in due 
course.</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha, he had been a very 
learned brahmin, living as an ascetic in the forest. One day he saw the Buddha, 
and, with clasped hands, praised his virtues (Thag.i.427f).  </p>
<p>He is evidently 
identical with Ñānathavika of the <a href="apadaana.htm" title="ay/apadaana.htm">Apadāna</a>. (Ap.ii.392f)</p>
