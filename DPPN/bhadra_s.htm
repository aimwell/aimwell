  <h2>Bhadra, or ? Bhagandha Hatthaka Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The headman Bhadragaka visits the Buddha at Uruvelakappa 
and asks for a teaching about dukkha. The Buddha says he will talk neither of 
the future nor of the past, but only of the present. By means of questioning 
Bhadragaka, the Buddha makes him realize that sorrow and suffering come only 
through desire. For example, he would grieve if anything happened to his friends 
in Uruvelakappa, or to his son CiravƒÅsi, or to his wife; but he would not worry 
about those who were unknown to him and therefore unloved by him (S.iv.327f).</p>
<p>The Commentary says (SA.iii.103) that in this sutta 
vattadukkha (? the sorrow of transmigration) is described.</p>
