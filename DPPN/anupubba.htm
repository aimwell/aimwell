<p>Setthi of Sāvatthi. He was so called 
because he engaged himself in a series of good works, each being of greater 
merit than the last, with the object of freeing himself from suffering. In the 
end he entered the Order, but finding the rules too numerous and irksome, he 
wished to return to the lay-life. His colleagues took him to the Buddha, who 
asked him to observe one rule only — guarding his mind; he agreed and became a 
Stream-enterer. DhA.i.297-300.</p>
