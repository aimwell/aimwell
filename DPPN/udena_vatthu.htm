  <h2>Udena Vatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story cycle of King Udena, in many 
respects the most interesting of all the stories of the Dhammapada Commentary 
(DhA,i.161-231). </p>
<p>It consists of six stories of diverse 
origin and character, dealing with the fortunes of the king, his three 
queen-consorts and his treasurer. </p>
<p>Only two of the stories are really 
concerned with Udena, the rest being introduced by familiar literary devices. 
Versions of each of the six stories occur in the writings of Buddhaghosa, 
indicating that they go back to a common source. </p>
<p>Parallels to one or more stories are 
also to be found in the Divy훮vad훮na, the Kath훮sarits훮gara and other Sanskrit 
collections and in the Tibetan Kandjur. </p>
<p>For an analysis of the cycle and its 
parallels see Burlinghame, Bud. Legends, i., pp.51 and 62ff.</p>
