<p>The Bodhisatta was once a world famed teacher. Among his 
pupils was Yava, son of the king of Benares. He was a good student, and when he 
was about to leave, the Bodhisatta, foreseeing danger for him, taught him three 
verses (the verses are in the nature of conundrums, with double meaning). The 
first two were based on incidents seen by the Bodhisatta – a horse killing the 
mouse that worried the sore place in his foot and throwing him into the well; 
and the same horse, later, trying to eat barley by putting its head through the 
fence; the third was made of his own accord. Later, Yava became king, and his 
son, when sixteen years old, made three attempts on his life. But they all 
failed because Yava repeated the stanzas taught him by the Bodhisatta. On each 
occasion the uttering of the stanzas made the boy feel that he was discovered, 
and he confessed his guilt, whereupon he was cast into chains.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to AjÄtasattu 
(J.iii.215 9). For details see the Thusa JÄtaka.</p>
