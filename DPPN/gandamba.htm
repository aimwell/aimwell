<p>The mango-tree, at the gate of Sāvatthi, 
under which the Buddha performed the Yamaka-pātihāriya (q.v.). The king’s 
gardener, Ganda, while on his way to the palace to give the king a ripe 
mango-fruit from the palace gardens, saw the Buddha going on his alms-rounds and 
offered him the mango. The Buddha ate it immediately, and gave the seed to 
Ānanda to be planted by the gardener at the city-gate. A tree of one hundred 
cubits sprouted forth at once, covered with fruit and flowers. At the foot of 
this tree Vissakamma, by the order of Sakka, built a pavilion of the seven kinds 
of precious things. J.iv.264f; J.i.88; DhA.iii.206ff; Mil.349.</p>
