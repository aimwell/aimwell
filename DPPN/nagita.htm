<h4>1. Nāgita Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. He belonged to a Sākiyan family in Kapilavatthu 
and entered the Order after hearing the preaching of the 
<a href="madhupindika_s.htm" title="ma/madhupindika_s.htm">Madhupindika Sutta</a>.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a Brahmin, named 
Nārada, and uttered three stanzas in praise of the Buddha. He was once a king 
named Sumitta (Thag.vs.86; ThagA.i.183f). He is probably identical with 
Atthasandassaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.169).</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nāgita Thera</h4>
<p>For some time the personal attendant of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (D.i.151; DA.i.310; A.iii.31, 341; iv.341; J.iv.95, etc.). He was the maternal 
uncle of the novice <a href="siha.htm#novice" title="s/siha.htm#novice">Sīha</a>, who is said to have addressed him by the name of Kassapa, his gotta 
name. He was fat and, therefore, lazy; he got most of his work done by Sīha.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nāgita Thera</h4>
<p>A thera of Ceylon, author of the Saddasāratthajālini. 
Gv.p.74; Svd.vs.1249.</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Nāgita Sutta</h4>
<p>Once, when the Buddha went to Icchānangala, the brahmin 
householders there came, in large numbers, to pay him their respects and made 
great uproar outside. When Nāgita, the Buddha’s personal attendant at the time, 
told him the cause of the clamour, the Buddha replied that he had nothing to do 
with homage; his concern was with renunciation. He went on to state five 
inevitable things: whosoever eats and drinks must answer the calls of nature; 
whosoever loves is destined to sorrow and despair; whosoever dwells on the 
asubha must feel disgust for the subha; whosoever sees impermanence in the six 
spheres of contact feels disgust for contact; whosoever sees the rise and fall 
in the five kinds of attachment, must feel disgust for attachment. A.iii.31ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nāgita Sutta</h4>
<p>The circumstances are the same as those of No. 1. The 
Buddha tells Nāgita that he is pleased with monks who do not live in the 
village, but who seek the forest and stave off gains and flattery, but to him 
the best is to walk on the highway unattached. A.iii.341ff.; cp. ibid., 
iv.341ff.</p>
