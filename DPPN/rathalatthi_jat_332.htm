  <h2>Rathalatthi Jātaka (No. 332)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The chaplain of the king of Benares, while on his way to his village estate, 
came upon a caravan in a narrow road, and, becoming impatient, threw his goad at 
the driver of the first cart. The goad, however, struck the yoke of his own 
chariot, and, rebounding, hit him on the forehead, where a lump appeared. He 
turned back in a rage and complained to the king, who, without any enquiry, 
confiscated the property of the caravan owner. But the Bodhisatta, who was the 
king’s chief judge, had the order reversed.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the chaplain of the king of Kosala, who 
was guilty of a similar offence, but, in this case, the king had the case 
examined by his judges and the chaplain was proclaimed guilty (J.iii.104ff). The 
stanzas of the Jātaka are quoted elsewhere. E.g., at J.iv.30, 451; vi.375.</p>
