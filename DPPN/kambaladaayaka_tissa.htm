<p>A name given to the monk who was later 
known as Vanavāsī-Tissa (q.v.). Though only seven years old, he was of great 
merit, and when he saw monks suffering from the cold he under took to find them 
blankets. One thousand monks went to Sāvatthi with him, and in a very short 
while he obtained for them more than the requisite number of blankets. 
Thenceforth he was called by the name of Kambaladāyaka. DhA.ii.89f.</p>
