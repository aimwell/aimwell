<p>A village, administered by the brahmins 
of the same name. Here halted the procession bearing the Sacred Bodhi-tree from 
Jambukola to AnurƒÅdhapura. </p>
<p>The brahmin, Tivakka, probably the head 
of the village, was present at the ceremony of the planting of the Bodhi-tree 
and later, one of the eight saplings from the tree was planted in the village.
