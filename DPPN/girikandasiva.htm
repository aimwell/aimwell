<p>A chieftain, uncle of Pandukābhaya and 
father of Suvannapāli. He had been appointed chieftain of the district of 
Girikanda by Panduvāsudeva, and refused to recognise Pandukābhaya’s claim to the 
throne (Mhv.x.29f). When Suvannapāli was carried away by Pandu-kābhaya, her 
father sent his five sons to rescue her, but they were all slain by Canda, son 
of Pandula (Mhv.x.41f). When Pandukābhaya became king he restored the province 
of Girikanda to his uncle, putting him in charge of it (Mhv.x.82).</p>
