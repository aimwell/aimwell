  <h2>Mahāpaduma Jātaka (No. 472)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Mahāpaduma, son of 
Brahmadatta, king of Benares. When Paduma’s mother died, his father took another 
wife. On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising, 
and, thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him, he entrusted her 
to the care of Paduma. The campaign was victorious. In the course of making 
arrangements for the celebration of his father’s return, Paduma entered the 
queen’s apartments. She was struck by his amazing beauty, and fell in love with 
him, inviting him to lie with her. On his indignant refusal, she feigned 
illness, and, on the return of the king, falsely accused him of having ill 
treated her. The king gave orders, in spite of the protestations of the people, 
that Paduma should be thrown from the “Robbers' Cliff.” The deity of the 
mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nāga king, who took 
him to his abode, where he stayed for one year. Paduma then went to the Himālaya 
and became an ascetic. The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom, 
but it was refused by Paduma. The king, convinced of the falsity of the charge 
brought against Paduma, caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers' Cliff.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Ciñcamānavikā’s 
false accusations against the Buddha. Ciñcā was the wicked queen, Devadatta the 
king, Sāriputta the deity, and Ānanda the Nāga. J.iv.187 96; DhA.iii.181ff.</p>
