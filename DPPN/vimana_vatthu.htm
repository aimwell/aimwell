  <h2>Vimāna Vatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The sixth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya. It describes the 
splendour of various celestial abodes belonging to different devas, obtained by 
them as reward for some meritorious act performed in a previous life. The 
stories were learnt from the devas themselves, by Moggallāna, Vangīsa and 
others, during their sojourn in the deva-worlds, and 
reported by them to the Buddha. </p>
<p>A Commentary on the work exists by Dhammapāla, forming 
part of the Paramatthadīpanī, and sometimes called Vimalatthavilāsinī (q.v.).</p>
<p>Stories from the Vimāna Vatthu were related by Mahinda in 
Ceylon in his first sermon to Anulā and her five hundred companions. Mhv.xiv.58.</p>
