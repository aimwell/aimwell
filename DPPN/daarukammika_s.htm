  <h2>Dārukammika Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A wood-seller visits the Buddha at 
Ñātika and tells him that, in his family, alms are given to various kinds of 
monks — forest-dwellers, rag-wearers, arahants, etc. </p>
<p>The Buddha points out to him that though 
it is difficult to distinguish the good and bad qualities of monks, yet he 
should continue to give alms to the Order. A.iii.391f.</p>
