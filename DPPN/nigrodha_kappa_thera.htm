  <h2>Nigrodha Kappa Thera</h2>

<p>He was the preceptor (upajjhāya) of Vangīsa, and together 
they lived in Aggālava cetiya (S.i.185), where Kappa died. When Vangīsa 
questioned the Buddha as to the destiny of Kappa, the Buddha’s answer was that 
he had completely passed away (Thag.vs.1263ff.; SN.vs.343ff). It is said 
(ThagA.ii.211; SNA.i.346) that Vangīsa was away when Kappa died, and had also 
seen him sleeping with his hands curled up. This was unlike a khīnāsava, but, in 
Kappa’s case, it was due to long continued habit. Vangīsa, not knowing this, was 
assailed with doubts as to his teacher’s attainments. Kappa was a vihāragaruka&nbsp;&nbsp; 
that is, he attached importance to keeping to his cell. When he came back from 
his alms rounds, he would enter his cell and not leave it again until evening or 
the next day. This caused disaffection in Vangīsa’s heart, which the latter 
quelled by force of reasoning (S.i.186; SA.i.208).</p>
<p>In Nigrodhakappa, Kappa was the thera’s personal name, but 
the prefix Nigrodha was given because he attained arahantship at the foot of a 
nigrodha (banyan) tree. SNA.i.346; because he dwelt under a banyan, says 
SA.i.207.</p>
