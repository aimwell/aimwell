  <h2>1. Metteyya</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>The future Buddha, the fifth of this kappa (Bu.xxvii.21). 
 
</p>
<p>According to the <a href="cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm" title="c/cakkavattisihanaada_s.htm">Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta</a>, he will be born, when human beings 
will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatī (present 
Benares), whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the 
fairy palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace 
away and will himself become a follower of Metteyya Buddha (D.iii.75ff).</p>
<p>The Anāgatavamsa (J.P.T.S.1886, pp.42, 46ff., 52; DhSA.415 
gives the names of his parents) gives further particulars. Metteyya will be born 
in a very eminent brahmin family and his personal name will be Ajita. Metteyya 
is evidently the name of his gotta. For eight thousand years he will live the 
household life in four palaces&nbsp;&nbsp; Sirivaddha, Vaddhamāna, Siddhattha 
and Candaka — his chief wife being Candamukhī 
and his son Brahmavaddhana. Having seen the four signs while on his way to the 
park, he will be dissatisfied with household life and will spend one week in 
practicing austerities. Then he will leave home, travelling in his palace and 
accompanied by a fourfold army, at the head of which will be eighty-four 
thousand brahmins and eighty four thousand Khattiya maidens. Among his followers 
will be Isidatta and Pūrana, two brothers, Jātimitta, Vijaya, Suddhika and 
Suddhanā, Sangha and Sanghā, Saddhara, Sudatta, Yasavatī and Visākhā, each with 
eighty four thousand companions. Together they will leave the household and 
arrive on the same day at the Bodhi tree. After the Enlightenment the Buddha 
will preach in Nāgavana and King Sankha will, later, ordain himself under him. 
Metteyya’s father will be Subrahmā, chaplain to King Sankha, and his mother 
Brahmavatī. His chief disciples will be Asoka and Brahmadeva among monks, and 
Padumā and Sumanā among nuns. Sīha will be his personal attendant and his chief 
patrons Sumana, Sangha, Yasavatī and Sanghā. His Bodhi will be the Nāga tree. 
After the Buddha’s death, his teachings will continue for one hundred and eighty 
thousand years.</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxxii.81f.; see Mil.159), 
Kākavannatissa and Vihāramahādevī, father and mother of Dutthagāmani, will be 
Metteyya’s parents, Dutthagāmani himself will be his chief disciple and 
Saddhātissa his second disciple, while Prince Sāli will be his son.</p>
<p>At the present time the future Buddha is living in the 
Tusita deva-world (Mhv.xxxii.73). There is a tradition that Nātha is the name of 
the future Buddha in the deva world.</p>
<p>The worship of the Bodhisatta Metteyya seems to have been 
popular in ancient Ceylon, and Dhātusena adorned an image of him with all the 
equipment of a king and ordained a guard for it within the radius of seven 
yojanas (Cv.xxxviii.68).</p>
<p>Dappula I. made a statue in honour of the future Buddha 
fifteen cubits high (Cv.xlv.62). It is believed that Metteyya spends his time in 
the deva-world, preaching the Dhamma to the assembled gods, and, in emulation of 
his example, King Kassapa V. used to recite the Abhidhamma in the assemblies of 
the monks (Cv.lii.47). Parakkamabāhu I. had three statues built in honour of 
Metteyya (Cv.lxxix.75), while Kittisirirājasīha erected one in the Rajata-vihāra 
and another in the cave above it (Cv.c.248,259). It is the wish of all Buddhists 
that they meet Metteyya Buddha, listen to his preaching and attain to Nibbāna 
under him. See, e.g., J.vi.594; MT. 687; DhSA.430.</p>
