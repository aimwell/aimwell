  <h2>Sangārava</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A very learned brahmin of Candalakappa. One day he saw 
Dhānañjānī trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, “Glory to the Buddha, the 
arahant, the all enlightened.” He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling 
monk, but when she told him of the Buddha’s marvellous qualities, he felt a 
desire to see him. Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed 
in Todeyya’s Mango grove. When Dhānañjānī told Sangārava that he was there, 
Sangārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha 
said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having 
discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He 
then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in 
due course, he won Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Sangārava asks further whether there are any gods. The 
Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement 
on that point. Sangārava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher 
(M.ii.209ff). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.808) that Sangārava was the youngest of 
the Bhāradvājas (q.v.), brothers of Dhānañjānī’s husband.</p>
<p>The Samyutta (S.i.182f) mentions a Sangārava who is 
perhaps distinct from the above. He lived in Sāvatthi and was a “bath ritualist,” 
believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening. The Buddha, at 
Ānanda’s request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after 
which he became the Buddha’s follower.</p>
<p>The Commentary (SA.i.207) explains that Ānanda and 
Sangārava had, as laymen, been friends, and Ānanda was anxious to prevent “this 
wretch (varāko) who, for all our friendship has contracted wrong views, from 
becoming a hell filler; moreover he has a circle of friends, and hundreds may 
follow if he is converted.”</p>
<p>Another Samyutta passage (S.v.121f.; see Sangārava Sutta, 
3) contains a sutta in which the brahmin Sangārava visits the Buddha and asks 
him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all. 
It may be this same brahmin who is mentioned several times also in the 
Anguttara. A.i.168 f; iii.230f.; v. 232, 252. For details see Sangārava SuttA (4 
7). </p>
<p>The Commentary states (AA.i.396) that he was an overseer 
in charge of the repair of the dilapidated buildings in Rājagaha (Rājagahanagare 
jinnapatisankhara nakārako āyuttakabrāhmano).</p>
