<p>An upāsaka of Ceylon. While he was a 
boy, his mother once fell grievously ill and the doctors ordered her hare’s 
flesh. Cakkana was sent by his brother into the field, where he caught a hare 
which, however, out of compassion he set free. His brother blamed him, but 
Cakkana cured his mother by a saccakiriyā, saying that, inasmuch as he had never 
deprived anything of life, by the power of that truth his mother should recover. 
(SA.ii.112; the story is slightly different in MA.i.165). Cakkana’s abstinence 
is one that was maintained “in spite of opportunity” (sampattivirati) and when 
he had not under-taken to observe any precept. DhsA., p. 103.</p>
