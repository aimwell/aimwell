  <h2>Pukkusāti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A young monk whom the Buddha met at the house of 
<a href="bhaggava.htm" title="b/bhaggava.htm">Bhaggava</a>, 
the potter, in <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. Pukkusāti was already occupying the guest room of the 
house, and the Buddha asked to be allowed to share it, to which Pukkusāti 
readily agreed. They sat together for sometime in silence, and then the Buddha 
preached the <a href="dhaatuvibhanga.htm" title="d/dhaatuvibhanga.htm">Dhātuvibhanga Sutta</a>. Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha at the end of 
the sermon and begged his forgiveness for not having paid him due honour; he 
then begged to have the upasampadā conferred on him. The Buddha consented and 
sent him to procure a begging bowl and a robe. On the way Pukkusāti was gored to 
death by a mad cow. When this was reported to the Buddha, he said that Pukkusāti 
was an Anāgāmin and had been born in the realms above, never more to return. 
M.iii.237 47. In this context Pukkusāti is spoken of as a kulaputta (iii.238); 
see also J.iv.180 and DhA.ii.35.</p>
<p>In his comments on the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta, Buddhaghosa 
gives a long account of Pukkusāti. MA.ii.979 ff. Cp. the story of Tissa, king of 
Roruva (ThagA.i.199f.)</p>
<p>He had been the king of <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, contemporary of 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> and of about the same age. A friendly alliance was established between 
the two kings through the medium of merchants who travelled between the two 
countries for purposes of trade. In the course of time, although the two kings 
had never seen each other, there grew up between them a deep bond of affection. Pukkusāti once sent to Bimbisāra, as a gift, eight priceless garments in 
lacquered caskets. This gift was accepted at a special meeting of the whole 
court, and Bimbisāra having nothing of a material nature, which he considered 
precious enough to send to Pukkusāti, conceived the idea of acquainting 
Pukkusāti with the appearance in the world of the Three Jewels (ratanāni) the 
Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He had inscribed on a golden plate, four 
cubits long and a span in breadth, descriptions of these Three Jewels and of 
various tenets of the Buddha’s teachings, such as the satipatthānā, the Noble 
Eightfold Path, and the Thirty seven factors of Enlightenment. This plate was 
placed in the innermost of several caskets of various precious substances, and 
was taken in procession on the back of the state elephant up to the frontier of 
Bimbisira’s kingdom. Similar honours were paid to it by the chiefs of other 
territories, through which lay the route to Takkasilā.  </p>
<p>When Pukkusāti, in the 
solitude of his chamber, read the inscription on the plate, he was filled with 
boundless joy and decided to renounce the world. He cut off his hair, donned the 
yellow robes of a monk, and left the palace alone amid the lamentations of his 
subjects. He travelled the one hundred and ninety two leagues to 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>, 
passing the gates of <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>; but having understood from Bimbisāra’s letter 
that the Buddha was at Rājagaha, he omitted to enquire for him at Jetavana, and 
travelled on forty five leagues more to Rājagaha, only to find that the Buddha 
was all the time in Sāvatthi. As it was then evening, he took lodging in Bhaggava’s house. The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw what was in store for 
Pukkusāti, and travelling on foot from Sāvatthi, reached Bhaggava’s house at 
sundown, and, waiting his opportunity, engaged Pukkusāti in talk and preached to 
him the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta, as related above. After his untimely death* 
Pukkusāti was born in the <a href="avihaa.htm" title="ay/avihaa.htm">Avihā</a> world, where, together with six others, he 
became an arahant at the moment of his birth (see S.i.35, 60, for the names of 
the others.).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*The cow that killed Pukkusāti is said to have been a 
  Yakkhinī who was a cow in one hundred births. In her last birth as a cow, she 
  killed, in addition to Pukkusāti, <a href="baahiya.htm" title="b/baahiya.htm">Bāhiya Dāruciriya</a>, 
  <a href="tambadaathika.htm" title="t/tambadaathika.htm">Tambadāthika</a>, and 
  <a href="suppabuddha.htm" title="s/suppabuddha.htm">Suppabuddha</a> the leper (DhA.ii.35).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pukkhusāti was one of seven monks who, in the time of 
Kassapa Buddha, decided to abstain from eating until they should attain 
arahantship. They lived on the top of a mountain. The senior monk attained 
arahantship, the second became an anāgāmī, but the remaining five died of 
starvation and were reborn in Tusita. In this age they became, respectively, 
Pukkusāti, <a href="kumaara_kassapa.htm" title="ku/kumaara_kassapa.htm">Kumāra Kassapa</a>, Dārucīriya, 
<a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabba Mallaputta</a> and 
<a href="sabhiya.htm" title="sa/sabhiya.htm">Sabhiya</a>. Ap.ii.473; 
DhA.ii.212; UdA.81; but see MA.i.335, where only three are mentioned (Pukkusāti, 
Dārucīriya, and Kassapa).</p>
