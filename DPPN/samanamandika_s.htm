<p>Pañcakanga, on his way to the Buddha, visits the 
Paribbājaka Uggāhamāna at the Samayappavādaka in the Tindukācīra in the 
Mallikārāma. Uggāhamāna tells him that, in his view, the triumphant recluse is 
he who does no evil, says and thinks no evil, and earns his living in no evil 
way. Pañcakanga reports this to the Buddha, who says that, according to 
Uggāhamāna, a tiny babe on its back would be such a recluse! No, says the 
Buddha, the triumphant recluse is one who is an adept in the Noble Eightfold 
Path and in utter knowledge and in utter deliverance, and he goes on to describe 
such a recluse in detail.' v.l. Samanamundikā. M.ii.22 9.</p>
