<p>1. KhemÄ TherÄ«.-An arahant, chief of the 
Buddhaâ€™s women disciples. She was born in a ruling family at SÄgala in the Madda 
country, and her skin was of the colour of gold. She became the chief consort of 
King BimbisÄra. She would not visit the Buddha who was at Veluvana, lest he 
should speak disparagingly of her beauty with which she was infatuated. The king 
bade poets sing the glories of Veluvana and persuaded KhemÄ to go there. She was 
then brought face to face with the Buddha, and he conjured up, for her to see, a 
woman like a celestial nymph who stood facing him. Even as KhemÄ gazed on the 
nymph, whose extraordinary beauty far excelled her own, she saw her pass 
gradually from youth to extreme old age, and so fall down in the swoon of death. 
Seeing that KhemÄ was filled with dismay at the sight, the Buddha preached to 
her on the vanity of lust, and we are told that at that moment she attained 
arahantship. With the consent of BimbisÄra she entered the Order, and was ranked 
by the Buddha foremost among his women disciples for her great insight (mahÄpaÃ±Ã±Änam 
aggÄ) (A.i.25; Dpv.xviii.9; see also MA.iv.168f.; Bu.xxvi.19; J.i.15,16).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara she was a 
slave, and having seen the Buddhaâ€™s chief disciple, SujÄta, gave him three 
cakes, and that same day she sold her hair and gave him alms.</p>
<p>In Kassapa Buddhaâ€™s time she became the 
eldest daughter of KikÄ«, king of Benares, and was named SamanÄ«. With her sisters 
she observed celibacy for twenty thousand years and built a monastery for the 
Buddha. She learnt the MahÄnidÄna Sutta, having heard the Buddha preach it. In 
the time of VipassÄ« she became a renowned preacher of the Dhamma, and during the 
time of both Kakusandha and KonÄgamana she had great monasteries built for the 
Buddha and his monks. AA.i.187f; Thig.139-44; ThigA.126ff; Ap.ii.543ff; 
DhA.iv.57ff; cf. the story of RÅ«pa NandÄ (DhA.iii.113-9).</p>
<p>Once when KhemÄ was at Toranavatthu, 
between SÄvatthi and SÄketa, Pasenadi, who happened to spend one night there, 
heard of her presence and went to see her. He questioned her as to whether or 
not the Buddha existed after death. She explained the matter to him in various 
ways, and Pasenadi, delighted with her exposition, related it to the Buddha 
(S.iv.374ff). She is mentioned in several places (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.347; 
S.ii.236) as the highest ideal of womanhood worthy of imitation, and is 
described as the nun par excellence.</p>
<p>KhemÄ is identified with the mother in 
the Uraga JÄtaka (J.iii.168), the queen in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423) and in the 
Hamsa (J.iv.430), the queen, KhemÄ, in the MahÄhamsa (J.v.382), and the princess 
in the MahÄjanaka (J.vi.68).</p>
<p>2. KhemÄ TherÄ«.-One of the two chief 
women disciples of DhammadassÄ« Buddha (Bu.xvi.19; J.i.39).</p>
<p>3. KhemÄ.-The Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.ii.791) (on A.iv.347) speaks of a KhemÄ UpÄsikÄ in a list of lay-women. This 
KhemÄ is most probably identical with KhemÄ (1).</p>
<p>4. KhemÄ.-Queen of Brahmadatta, king of 
Benares. She dreamed of a golden peacock preaching, and wished that her dream 
might come true. Though the king tried every means in his power, the wish could 
not be fulfilled and the queen died. See the Mora JÄtaka. J.ii.36.</p>
<p>5. KhemÄ.-Chief queen of Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares. She dreamed of a golden deer preaching the Dhamma, and her wish 
to see her dream come true was fulfilled (J.iv.256). For details see the Ruru 
JÄtaka.</p>
<p>6. KhemÄ.-Chief queen of Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares (J.iv.334). Her story is similar to that of KhemÄ (4). For 
details see the MahÄ-Mora JÄtaka.</p>
<p>7. KhemÄ.-Queen Consort of Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares (J.iv.413). Her story is similar to that of KhemÄ (5). She is 
identical with KhemÄ TherÄ« (J.iv.423). See the Rohantamiga JÄtaka.</p>
<p>8. KhemÄ.-Queen Consort of King Seyya (Samyama) 
of Benares. She saw a golden swan in a dream, and wished to see one in real life 
(J.v.354). She is identified with KhemÄ TherÄ« (J.v.382). For details see the 
Mahàhamsa JÄtaka.</p>
<p>9. KhemÄ.-A river flowing from HimavÄ 
(J.v.199f).</p>
