<p><b>1. Sonā. </b>One of the chief women patrons of 
Dīpankara Buddha. Bu.ii.215.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sonā.</b> An aggasāvikā, of Sumana Buddha. Bu.v.24; 
J.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sonā. </b>An eminent lay woman, disciple of the 
Buddha. A.iv.348.</p>

<p><b>4. Sonā.</b> An eminent Therī of Ceylon. Dpv.xviii.38.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sonā.</b> A Therī. She was declared foremost among 
nuns for capacity of effort (āraddhaviriyānam). She belonged to the family of a 
clansman of Sāvatthi, and because, after marriage, she had ten sons and 
daughters, she came to be called <b>Bahuputtikā</b>. When her husband renounced the 
world, she distributed her wealth among her children, keeping nothing for 
herself.</p>
<p>Her children soon ceased to show her any respect, and she 
entered the Order in her old age. She waited on the nuns and studied most of the 
night. Soon her strenuous energy became known to the Buddha, and he, sending 
forth a ray of glory, spoke to her. Then she attained arahantship. Her resolve 
to win eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when she was the 
daughter of a rich setthi. (A.i.25; Thig.vss.102-6; ThigA.96f.; Ap.ii.576; cf. 
the story of Bahuputtikā at DhA.ii.276f).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Commentary says (AA.i.199) that after she 
became an arahant she wished her colleagues to know this because they had been 
in the habit of constantly finding fault with her for various things, and she 
did not wish them to continue doing so and thereby commit a sin. She therefore 
filled a vessel with water, which she heated by her iddhi-power, using no fire. 
When the nuns came to look for water she told them that if they wanted warm 
water they could have it from the vessel. They found the water hot, and 
understood. Then they begged her forgiveness.</p>
