<p>Records the incident of the death of 
Upasena Vangantaputta from a snake-bite. Summoned by him, Sāriputta looked at 
him and said that he noticed no change at all in Upasena, either in his body or 
in his faculties. Upasena answered that that was because he had long before 
quelled all lurking tendencies of “I” and “mine.” S.iv.40f.</p>
