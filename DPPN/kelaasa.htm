<p>1. Kelāsa.-A mountain range in Himavā. 
It is one of the five ranges which stand round Anotatta and is of silver colour, 
two hundred leagues high, bent inwards “like a crow’s beak.” (SNA.ii.437f; 
MA.ii.585; UdA.300; AA.ii.759). It is sixty leagues in breadth, and Ālavaka, on 
his way to his house, having heard to his great anger that the Buddha was there, 
placed his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta. The touch of 
his foot sent pieces of the rock flying, and his shout “I am Ālavaka” was heard 
throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).</p>
<p>Kelāsa is often used in similes to 
describe an object that is perfectly white (E.g., J.iv.232; vi.490, 515; the 
horse Kanthaka, Mbv.26; DhA.i.192; Cv.lxxiii.114), very stately (E.g., an 
elephant’s head or a big building, J.i.321; v.52, 53; Cv.lxxviii.77), or 
difficult to destroy (E.g., J.v.39).</p>
<p>In the Mahāvastu (ii.97, 109; see also 
iii.309, 438), Kailāsa is mentioned as the abode of the Kinnaras. </p>
<p>In Sanskrit mythology, Kailāsa is given 
as the abode of the gods, chiefly Siva and Kubera. See, e.g., Epic Mythology 
passim and Ved. Ind. s.v. The mountain range has been identified as belonging to 
the trans-Himālayan system and consisting of a group of mountains over twenty 
thousand feet in height (see Cv.Trs.i.280, n.4).</p>

<p>2. Kelāsa.-A vihāra in Ceylon, probably 
in the district of Malagana. At one time sixty thousand monks dwelt there with 
Khuddatissa at their head (M.xxxii.53). This is probably not the Kelāsa vihāra 
(in Jambudīpa?) whence, we are told, Suriyagotta came with ninety thousand monks 
to the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa. M.xxix.43.</p>
