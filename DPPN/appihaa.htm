<p>A Sāmanera who lived in the Suvannakuti 
in Dakkhinagiri-vihāra.  </p>
<p>On the day after his ordination his mother had prepared 
seats and alms for eight monks, and, by the power of iddhi, these were made to 
suffice for 68,000 monks.  </p>
<p>The story is told in order to show the power of iddhi 
in connection with the Mahā Thūpa ceremonies (Ambasuppiya). (MT.552)</p>
