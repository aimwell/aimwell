<p>The Bodhisatta was once a very skilful archer, educated at 
Takkasilā and famed as Culla Dhanuggaha. He was a crooked little dwarf and, lest 
he should be refused employment on account of his size, he persuaded a tall, 
well built weaver, called Bhīmasena, to be his stalking horse. Bhīmasena went 
with him to the king of Benares and obtained the post of royal archer. Once, the 
kingdom was attacked by a tiger and Bhīmasena was sent to kill it. Following the 
advice of the Bodhisatta, he went with a large band of country men, and when the 
tiger was sighted he waited in a thicket and lay flat on his face. When he knew 
that the tiger had been killed, he came out of the thicket trailing a creeper in 
his hand and blamed the people, saying that he had meant to lead the tiger like 
an ox to the king and had gone into the wood to find a creeper for that purpose. 
“Who has killed the tiger and spoilt all my plans?” he asked. “I will report all 
of you to the king.” The terrified people bribed him heavily and said no word as 
to who had killed the tiger. The king, believing that Bhīmasena himself had 
killed it, rewarded him handsomely. The same thing happened with a buffalo. 
Bhīmasena grew rich and began to neglect the Bodhisatta. Soon after, a hostile 
king marched on Benares. Bhīmasena went with a large army riding on an elephant, 
the Bodhisatta behind him, but at the sight of the battlefield Bhīmasena was so 
terrified that he fouled the elephant’s back. The Bodhisatta taunted him and 
sent him home, while he himself captured the enemy king and brought him to the 
king of Benares, who showed him all honour.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who, although 
of low family, used to boast of that family’s greatness. The truth was 
discovered and his pretensions exposed. He is identified with Bhīmasena. J.i.355-9.</p>
