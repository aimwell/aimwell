<p>A nickname given to Jetthatissa I. When 
certain of his ministers chewed reluctance to accompany his father’s funeral 
procession, he finally persuaded them; but when they were assembled he had the 
gates shut on them, put them to death, and had their bodies empaled on stakes 
round his father’s pyre. Hence his name. Mhv.xxxvi.118-22.</p>
