<p><b>1. Sāketa Jātaka (No. 68). </b>Once, when the Buddha 
visited Sāketa, an old brahmin met him at the gate and fell at his feet, calling 
him his son, and took him home to see his “mother“&nbsp;&nbsp; the brahmin’s 
wife&nbsp;&nbsp; and his “brothers and sisters“&nbsp;&nbsp; the brahmin’s 
family. There the Buddha and his monks were entertained to a meal, at the end of 
which the Buddha preached the Jarā Sutta. Both the brahmin and his wife became 
Sakadāgāmins. When the Buddha returned to Añjanavana, the monks asked him what 
the brahmin had meant by calling him his son. The Buddha told them how the 
brahmin had been his father in five hundred successive past births, his uncle in 
a like number, and his grandfather in another five hundred. The brahmin’s wife 
had similarly been his mother, his aunt, and his grandmother. J.i.308f; cf. 
DhA.iii.317f.; SNA.ii.532f.</p>

<p><b>2. Sāketa Jātaka (No. 237). </b>The story of the 
present is the same as in Jātaka (1) above. When the Buddha returned to the 
monastery he was asked how the brahmin had recognized him. He explained how' in 
those who have loved in previous lives, love springs afresh, like lotus in the 
pond. J.i.234f</p>
<p>Sāketa Sutta. The Buddha explains to the monks at Sāketa 
how it is possible to reckon the five indriyas as the five balas and the five 
balas as the five indriyas. By developing the five indriyas, release can be 
attained. S.v.219f.</p>
