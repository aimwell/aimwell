<p>An arahant. He was born in Pāvā in the 
family of a Malla chieftain, and was called Khandasumana because, on his 
birthday, molasses and jasmine appeared in his house. Having heard the Buddha 
preaches in Cunda’s mango-grove at Pāvā, he entered the Order and became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the past he had built a railing of 
sandalwood round the thūpa of Padumuttara Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha 
he was unable to get any flowers, the king having bought them all for his 
offerings; he therefore bought a khandasumana-flower at a great price and 
offered it at the thūpa of the Buddha (Thag.96; ThagA.i.198).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Saparivāriya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.172). His Apadāna-verses are almost the 
same as those attributed to Nandiya Thera. See ThagA.i.82.</p>
