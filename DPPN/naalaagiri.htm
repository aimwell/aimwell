<p>An elephant of the royal stalls at Rājagaha. Devadatta, 
after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajātasattu’s consent to 
use Nālagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha’s death. The elephant, he 
said, knows nothing of the Buddha’s virtues and will have no hesitation in 
destroying him. Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his 
fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount 
of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of 
the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the 
Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he 
ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen 
monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror. 
Ānanda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the 
Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to 
make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. Just then, a 
woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror 
dropping the child at the Buddha’s feet. As the elephant was about to attack the 
child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, 
and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead. Thrilling 
with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha, and the 
Buddha taught him the Dhamma. It is said that had the elephant not been a wild 
beast he would have become a sotāpanna. Marvelling at the sight, the assembled 
populace threw all their ornaments on the elephant’s body, covering it entirely, 
and henceforth the elephant was known as Dhanapāla (Dhanapālaka). The Buddha 
returned to Veluvana, and that day, at eventide, preached the Cullahamsa Jātaka 
in praise of Ānanda’s loyalty to himself (Vin.ii.194f.: J.v.333ff.; Avedānas i. 
177). It is said (Mil. 349) that nine hundred million living beings, who saw the 
miracle, realized the Truth.</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta, in a past life, was once riding an 
elephant when he saw a Pacceka Buddha. Intoxicated by his own glory, he made the 
elephant charge the Pacceka Buddha. It was as a result of this action that the 
Buddha, in this birth, was charged by Nālāgiri (UdA.265; Ap.i.300). cp. 
Donamukha.</p>
