<p>A village in Ceylon, where Bhalluka 
pitched his camp (Mhv.xxv.80; see also Mhv. Trs.176, n.2). It is probably 
identical with Kolambālaka (Mhv.xxxiii.42), in which case it was near the 
Titthārāma, in the neighbourhood of the northern gate of Anurādhapura. There was 
also a monastery called Kolambahalāka founded by Sūratissa, and said to have 
been near Raheraka (Mhv.xxi.5). The Kolambahālaka-parivena was the residence of 
the monk Dāthāvedhaka. MT.176.</p>
