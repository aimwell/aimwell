<p><b>1. Aggi Sutta.</b>-A number of monks go to 
the Paribbājakārāma at Sāvatthi, and have a courteous discussion with the 
Paribbājakas, who claim that their teaching is the same as the Buddha’s. The 
monks are unable to refute their claim and seek the Buddha’s advice. He tells 
them that the bojjhangas form the distinctive feature of the Dhamma and that the 
Paribbājakas, if questioned about them, would not be able to answer. S.v.112.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Aggi Sutta.</b>-On the seven kinds of 
fires. A.iv.41.</p>
