<p>1. Dhātusena.-A householder of 
Nandivāpigāma, father of Dāthānāma. Cv.xxxviii.14.</p>
<p>2. Dhātusena.-King of Ceylon (460-78 A.C.). 
He was the son of Dāthānāma and brother of Silātissabodhi. He seems to have had 
another brother, Kumārasena (q.v.). Dhātusena belonged to the Morjyavamsa. He 
became a monk under his uncle, the incumbent of Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena, and 
remained with him till preparations for his campaign were made. Then he returned 
to the lay life, killed the Pāndyan, Tiritara, then reigning at Anurādhapura, 
and became king. His chief work was the construction of the Kālavāpi, which he 
carried out by damming the Gonanadī. He built eighteen vihāras and eighteen 
tanks. He showed great favour to the monks and did many works of piety. The 
Ambatthala-vihāra he gave to the Dhammarucikas.</p>
<p>He had two sons — Moggallāna and 
Kassapa. Kassapa rebelled against his father at the instigation of his 
brother-in-law-who had been punished for ill-treating the king’s daughter — and 
seized Dhātusena in the hope of securing his treasure. The king asked to be 
taken to Kālavāpi, saw the Thera who had been his teacher, and announced that 
his whole treasure was the Kālavāpi. Kassapa then had him buried alive.</p>
<p>Among Dhātusena’s gifts is mentioned 
that of one thousand gold pieces spent by him for an interpretation (?) of the 
Dīpavamsa (dīpetum Dīpavamsam). Cv.xxxviii.14f, 30ff.</p>
<p>3. Dhātusena.-A vihāra. See 
Uttaradhātusena.</p>
