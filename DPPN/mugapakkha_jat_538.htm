<p>Also called Temiya Jātaka. Candādevī, wife of the king of 
Kāsi, had, to her great grief, no son. Sakka’s throne was heated by her piety, 
and he persuaded the Bodhisatta, then in Tāvatimsa, to be born as her son. The 
Bodhisatta reluctantly agreed. Great were the rejoicings over his birth. He was 
called Temiya because on the day of his birth there was a great shower 
throughout the kingdom and he was born wet. When he was one month old, he was 
brought to the king, and, as he lay in his lap, he heard grievous sentences 
passed on some robbers brought before the king. Later, as he lay in bed, Temiya 
recollected his past births and remembered how he had once reigned for twenty 
years as king of Benares, and, as a result, had suffered in Ussada niraya for 
twenty thousand years. Anguish seized him at the thought of having to be king 
once more, but the goddess of his parasol, who had once been his mother, 
consoled him by advising him to pretend to be dumb and incapable of any action. 
He took this advice, and for sixteen years the king and queen, in consultation 
with the ministers and others, tried every conceivable means of breaking his 
resolve, knowing him to be normal in body. But all their attempts failed, and at 
last he was put in a chariot and sent with the royal charioteer, Sunanda, to the 
charnel ground, where he was to be clubbed to death and buried. At the queen’s 
urgent request, however, Temiya was appointed to rule over Kāsi for one week 
before being put to death, but the enjoyment of royal power did not weaken his 
resolve. The charioteer, under the influence of Sakka, took Temiya to what he 
considered to be the charnel-ground and there, while Sunanda was digging the 
grave, Temiya stole up behind him and confided to him his purpose and his 
resolve to lead the ascetic life. Sunanda was so impressed by Temiya’s words 
that he immediately wished to become an ascetic himself, but Temiya desired him 
to inform his parents of what had happened. When the king and queen heard 
Sunanda’s news, they went with all their retinue to Temiya’s hermitage and 
there, after hearing Temiya preach, they all became ascetics. The inhabitants of 
the three kingdoms adjacent to Benares followed their example, and great was the 
number of ascetics. Sakka and Vissakamma provided shelter for them. The crowds 
who thus flocked together were called the Mūgapakkha samāgama. With the death of 
Malayamahādeva Thera (q.v.) came the end of those who participated in this great 
collection of ascetics.</p>
<p>Temiya’s parents are identified with the parents of the 
Buddha, Sunanda with Sāriputta and the goddess of the parasol with Uppalavannā. 
The story was told in reference to the Buddha’s Renunciation (J.vi.1-30; 
the story of Temiya is also given in Temiyacariyā in Cyp.iii.6). It is often 
referred to (E.g., BuA.51) as giving an example of the Bodhisattva’s great 
determination. The Dhammika Sutta (q.v.) mentions Mūgapakkha in a list of 
teachers of old.</p>
