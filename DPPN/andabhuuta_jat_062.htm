  <h2>Andabhūta Jātaka (No. 62)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On the innate wickedness of woman. A 
girl is bred from infancy among women only, never seeing any man but her 
husband, the king’s chaplain. The latter had embarked on the enterprise of so 
bringing up the girl, in order to defeat the king at dice, because the king was 
in the habit of winning by a declaration of truth to the effect that all women 
were treacherous; the chaplain wanted to find an exception in order to falsify 
the declaration. For a time the experiment succeeds, but later, as a result of 
the king’s scheming, the girl starts an intrigue with a flower-seller as lover 
and is discovered (J.i.289ff). The Jātaka is so called because the woman in the 
story was guarded from the time she lay in her mother’s womb as a foetus (andabhūta).</p>
<p>The story was related concerning a monk 
who was worried by his passions.</p>
