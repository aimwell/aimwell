<p>One of the monks whom Devadatta incited 
to join him in stirring up discord among the Sangha, the others being Kokālika, 
Khandadevīputta and Samuddadatta (Vin.ii.196; iii.171). Katamorakatissa was held 
in high esteem by Thullānandā, for we are told that one day, on arriving at a 
house where she was a constant visitor, and on being told that several of the 
Buddha’s eminent disciples, such as Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Mahā Kaccāna, had 
also been invited, as they happened to be at Veluvana near by, she expressed 
great disappointment that these had been invited, when such most eminent 
disciples (mahānāgā) as Devadatta, Katamorakatissa, etc., were available. 
Vin.iv.66.</p>
<p>On another occasion, wishing to ordain a 
nun who was going through a probationary course, she summoned the monks, but 
seeing a great quantity of food and wishing to let only her favourites enjoy it, 
she dismissed the monks on a false pretext, keeping with her only Devadatta, 
Katamorakatissa and their colleagues (Vin.iv.335).</p>
<p>Katamorakatissaka was one of the monks 
about whom dissatisfaction was expressed to the Buddha, by the two Pacceka-brahma, 
Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa. S.i.148.</p>
