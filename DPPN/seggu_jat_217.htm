<p>The story of greengrocers who, in order to test his 
daughter, Seggu, took her to the woods and made as if wishing to seduce her. But 
she begged for his protection, and he, convinced of her virtue, gave her in 
marriage to a good young man.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a greengrocer of 
Sāvatthi, who similarly tested his daughter. The characters in both stories were 
identical. J.ii.179f.</p>
