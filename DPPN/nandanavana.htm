<h4>1. Nandanavana</h4>
<p>The chief of the parks in Tāvatimsa, where the inhabitants 
of Tāvatimsa, headed by Indra, go for their amusement. (E.g., DhA.ii.266; 
A.iii.40; J.vi.240; VvA.7, 34, 61, etc.; PvA.173, 176, 177, etc.; Mtu.i.32, 
etc.). Cakkavatti kings are born in Tāvatimsa after death and spend their time 
in Nandanavana (S.v.342). It is said (E.g., J.i.49) that there is a Nandanavana 
in each deva world. The devas go there just before their death and disappear in 
the midst of their revels. Thus, the Bodhisatta went to Nandanavana in the 
Tusita world before his “descent” into Mahāmāyās womb (J.i.50; see also 
J.vi.144). In Nandanavana is a lake called Nandana (J.ii.189) and evidently also 
a palace called Ekapundarīkavimāna (MT.568). Nandanavana was so called because 
it awoke delight in the hearts of all who visited it (J.v.158). Sometimes 
ascetics, like Nārada (Ibid.,392), possessed of great iddhi-power, would spend 
their siesta in the shadow of the grove.</p>

<h4>2. Nandanavana</h4>
<p>A park in Anurādhapura between the Mahāmeghavana and the 
southern wall of the city. Mahinda preached there, to the assembled populace, 
the Bālapanita Sutta, the day after his arrival in Anurādhapura. Later, on 
successive days, he preached the Asīvisūpama, the Anamatagga, the Khajjanīya, 
the Gomayapindī and the Dhammacakkappavattana Suttas. On the occasions of the 
preaching of these various suttas, thousands of people attained to various 
fruits of the Path, and, because the park was the first centre from which 
Mahinda radiated a knowledge of the Buddha’s teaching' it came to be called the 
Jotivana, by which name it was known later. Mhv.xv.1, 4, 176, 178, 186, 195, 
197, 199, 202; Dpv.xiii.11, 12, 14, 15; xiv.12, 17, 44, 48; Sp.i.80 82.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;3. Nandanavma</h4>
<p>A private park in Pulatthipura, laid out by Parakkamabāhu 
I. Cv.lxxiii.97; lxxix.2.</p>
