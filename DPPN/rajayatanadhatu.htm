<p>Probably identical with Rājāyatana cetiya in Nāgadīpa. Aggabodhi II. built 
for it the Unnalomaghara vihārā (C.xlii.62). </p>
<p>The cetiya was perhaps erected in honour of the Rājāyatana tree, which was 
brought by Samiddhisumana from Jetavana when he came with the Buddha to Ceylon 
(See Mhv.i.52, 57f). </p>
<p>It is said (DA.iii.899) that when the Buddha’s religion disappears, all the 
relics of the Buddha in Ceylon will gather together at the Mahācetiya, proceed 
from there to the Rājāyatana cetiya in Nāgadīpa, and from there, finally, to the 
Bodhi tree.</p>
