<p>A thera. He had a brother, also a monk, 
named Isibhatta. Having spent the rainy season in Sāvatthi, they went to take up 
their abode in a certain village. The people there gave them food and robes, but 
they refused to accept their share of these, because, according to the rule, the 
robes are the property of the Sangha until the Kathina-ceremony has been 
performed. The story is mentioned in connection with accepting robes elsewhere 
than in the spot where the rainy season has been spent. Vin.i.299.</p>
