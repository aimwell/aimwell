<h4>1. Paduma</h4>
<p>The eighth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in 
Campaka. His father was the Khattiya Asama (but see J.i.36, where he is called 
Paduma ) and his mother Asamā. For ten thousand years he lived as a householder 
in three palaces: Nandā, Suyasā and Uttarā (BuA. calls them Uttarā, Vasuttarā 
and Yasuttarā). His wife was Uttarā and his son Ramma. He left home in a chariot 
and practiced austerities for eight months. Dhaññavatī gave him milk rice, and 
an Ajīvaka, named Titthaka, spread grass for his seat under his bodhi tree, 
which was a Mahāsona. He preached his first sermon in Dhanañjuyyāna. His chief 
disciples were his younger brothers Sāla and Upasāla and his attendant was 
Varuna. Rādhā and Surādhā were his chief women disciples, and his chief patrons 
were Bhiyya and Asama among men and Rucī and Nandarāmā among women. </p>
<p>His body was fifty eight cubits high, and he lived for one 
hundred thousand years. He died in Dhammārāma and his relics were scattered. The 
Buddhavamsa Commentary states that his full name was Mahāpaduma, that he was so 
called because on the day of his birth a shower of lotuses fell over Jambudīpa, 
and that, at that time, the Bodhisatta was a lion.</p>

<h4>8. Paduma</h4>
<p>A cetiya built by Mahā Kaccāna, in a previous birth, for 
Padumuttara Buddha (Ap.i.84). The Apadāna Commentary explains that the building 
was, in fact, a gandhakuti, which was called a cetiya as a mark of respect (pūjanīyabhāvena), 
and that it was called Paduma because it was shaped like a lotus and was covered 
with lotuses.</p>
<hr>
<h4>9. Paduma Thera</h4>
<p>An arahant. He once threw a lotus to Padumuttara Buddha as 
he was traveling through the air, and the Buddha accepted it. For thirty kappas 
Paduma was king of the devas, and for seven hundred king of men. Ap.i.109f.</p>
