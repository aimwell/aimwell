<h2>1. Macha Jātaka (No. 34)</h2>
<p>Some fishermen once cast their net into a river, and a 
great fish, swimming along, toying amorously with his wife, was caught in the 
net, while his wife escaped. The fishermen hauled him up and left him on the 
sand while they proceeded to light a fire and whittle a spit whereon to roast 
him. The fish lamented, saying how unhappy his wife would be, thinking he had 
gone off with another. The Bodhisatta, who was the king’s priest, coming along 
to the river to bathe, heard the lament of the fish and obtained his freedom 
from the fishermen.</p>
<p>The story was related to a passion tossed monk who longed 
for the wife of his lay days. The two fish were the monk and his seducer. 
J.i.210-12.</p>

<h2>2. Maccha Jātaka (No. 75)</h2>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as a fish in a pond; there 
was a great drought, the crops withered, and water gave out in tanks and ponds 
and there was great distress. Seeing this, the Bodhisatta approached Pajjuna, 
god of rain, and made an Act of Truth, begging for rain. The request succeeded, 
and heavy rain fell.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a great drought in 
Kosala. Even the pond by the gate of Jetavana was dry, and the Buddha, touched 
by the universal suffering, resolved to obtain rain. On his way back from the 
alms round, he sent Ānanda to fetch the robe in which he bathed. As he was 
putting this on, Sakka’s throne was heated, and he ordered Pajjuna to send rain. 
The god filled himself with clouds, and then bending his face and mouth, deluged 
all Kosala with torrents of rain. The Pajjuna of the earlier story is identified 
with Ānanda. J.i.329 32; cp. Cyp.iii.10.</p>

<h2><b>3. Maccha Jātaka </b>(No. 216)</h2>
<p>The story very much 
  resembles Maccha Jātaka (1). J.ii.178f.</p>
