<p>1. Devasabha Thera.-An arahant. He was 
the son of the ruler of a province and succeeded to the title when quite young. 
He visited the Buddha, and after hearing him preach, entered the Order, 
attaining arahantship shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
dove, and, having seen the Buddha, offered him a piyāla-fruit. He was three 
times king under the name of Piyālī (Thag.v.100; ThagA.i.187f). He is probably 
identical with Piyālaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.169f.</p>
<p>2. Devasabha Thera.-An arahant. He was a 
Sākiyan of Kapilavatthu. He witnessed the Buddha settle the quarrel between the 
Sākiyans and the Koliyans and was established in the Refuges. Later he visited 
the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma and entered the Order, afterwards attaining 
arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a 
householder and offered the Buddha bandhujīvaka-flowers. Seven kappas ago he was 
a king named Samantacakkhu (Thag.v.100; ThagA.i.203f).</p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
Bandhujīvaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.175f.</p>
