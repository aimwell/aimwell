<h4>1. Nidāna Sutta</h4>
<p>The three means by which deeds are heaped up: greed, 
hatred and delusion. A.iii.338.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nidāna Sutta</h4>
<p>Preached at Kammāsadamma. Ānanda tells the Buddha that 
though the Paticcasamuppāda is so deep, yet, to him, it is so plain. The Buddha 
warns him against such an idea, because all samsāra is due to lack of 
understanding of the Causal law (S.ii.92). This sutta was probably called the 
Cūlanidāna Sutta (E.g., MA.i. 225; VibhA.267) as opposed to the Mahānidāna 
Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Nidāna Suttā</h4>
<p>Two suttas on the three originating causes of action: 
lust, malice and delusion. A.i.134f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nidāna Suttā</h4>
<p>The three causes of action: lust, malice and delusion.

<h4>3. Nidāna Sutta</h4>

of actions. A.i.264.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nidāna Suttā</h4>
<p>Actions are originated by desire for things which, in the 
past, were based on desire, for the like things in the future and at the present 
time. A.i.265.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nidāna Suttā</h4>
<p>The opposite of No. 4. A.i.266.</p>
