<p>King of <a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a>, in the country of 
Kampilla. His chaplain was Kevatta. For their story see the 
<a href="mahaummagga_jat_546.htm" title="maha/mahaummagga_jat_546.htm">Mahā 
Ummagga Jātaka</a>. Cūlani is identified with Sāriputta (J.vi.478). He is also called Cūlaniya 
(J.vi.437, 477) and Cūlaneyya (J.vi.437).</p>
<p>The <a href="peta_vatthu.htm" title="pu/peta_vatthu.htm">Petavatthu</a> (Pv.ii.13; PvA.160ff ) 
contains a story of a queen of Cūlani-Brahmadatta called 
<a href="ubbarii.htm" title="u/ubbarii.htm">Ubbarī</a>, whom he 
discovered while wandering about in his kingdom disguised as a tailor. Here the 
king is also referred to as Cūlaniputta (vs.8.9), and the scholiast explains 
(PvA.164) that Cūlani was his father’s name; it is said (Pv.ii.13, vs.9, 10) 
that there were innumerable kings of <a href="pancala.htm" title="pa/pancala.htm">Pañcāla</a> bearing that name.</p>
