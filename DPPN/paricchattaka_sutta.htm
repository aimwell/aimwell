  <h2>Pāricchattaka Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Just as the devas in Tāvatimsa rejoice on seeing the 
Pāricchattaka tree gradually growing and putting forth flowers, and hold 
celebrations at each stage, so do they rejoice when the householder leaves the 
world and joins the Order, finally attaining to nibbāna. His fame spreads from 
world to world, even up to the Brahma world (A.iv.117ff). </p>
<p>The sutta was evidently also known as the 
Pāricchattakopama. E.g., AA.i.32; MA.i.14.</p>
