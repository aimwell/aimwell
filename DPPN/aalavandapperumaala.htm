<p>A Damila general defeated by 
Parakkamabāhu I, (Cv.lxxvi.128). He belonged to the immediate retinue of King 
Kulasekhara. In the battle of Pātapa he was wounded and fled, but his enemies 
succeeded in slaying the horse on which he rode (Cv.lxxvi.223, 232). He is 
perhaps to be identified with Ālavanda who was slain by Parakkamabāhu in the 
village of Vadali (Cv.lxxvi.134).</p>
