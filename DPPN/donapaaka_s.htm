<p>Once Pasenadi, uncomfortable and short 
of breath after a heavy meal, visited the Buddha. The Buddha admonished him on 
the evils of gluttony and taught the young Sudassana, who came with Pasenadi, a 
verse to be repeated whenever food was placed before the king. The king paid the 
young man one hundred kahāpanas daily for this service. Pasenadi profited by the 
lesson and became healthy. S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f gives a fuller version of this 
story. There Sudassana is described as the king’s nephew. This is also probably 
the incident mentioned at DhA.iv.15f; but the youth there is called Uttara.</p>
