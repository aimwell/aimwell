<p>A mahāsāla brahmin, ranking with eminent 
brahmins such as Cankī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti and Todeyya (SN. p.115). He is 
mentioned as staying in Icchānangala (M.ii.196), where he evidently took part in 
the periodical gatherings of brahmin leaders — and also at Manasākata (D.i.235). 
He was a follower of the Buddha, of whom he was a great admirer. He appears to 
have been in the habit of talking to well known teachers of other schools and 
hearing their opinion of the Buddha, either for the purpose of comparing his own 
faith in him or of discovering their views. Two such conversations are recorded 
- one with Subha Todeyyaputta (M.ii.209), the other with Pilotika (M.i.175ff). 
His discussion with Pilotika he reported to the Buddha, who expanded it to form 
the Culahatthipadopama Sutta. The Buddha also preached to Jānussoni the 
Bhayabherava Sutta (M.i.16ff). Jānussoni’s permanent residence was Sāvatthi 
(DA.ii.399), and he often visited the Buddha at Jetavana, consulting him on many 
topics, such as: results of actions (A.i.56), sanditthaka-nibbāna (A.i.157), 
tevijja-brahmins (A.i.166), fearlessness of death (A.ii.173), the ideals of 
various classes of persons (A.iii.362), true celibacy (A.iv.54), the Paccārohani 
ceremony (A.v.233ff., 249ff.), the efficacy of gifts (A.v.269ff.), and 
eternalism and annihilation (S.ii.76). He had a white chariot with silver 
fittings and white trappings drawn by four pure white mares. He would drive 
about in this, wearing white garments, turban-cloths and sandals and fanned by a 
white fan. The reins, the goads and the canopy were also of white. His chariot 
was considered the finest in all Sāvatthi (S.v.4f; cp. M.i.175 and ii.208). 
Buddhaghosa says that Jānussoni was not his personal name but the name of the 
rank he held as chaplain to the Kosala king. MA.i.90; according to AA. (i.308) 
it was the name of any noble family, members of which held this rank. Cp. 
Govindiye abhisiñci (at D.ii.231).</p>
