<p><b>1. Rohitassa</b>. A devaputta. He once visited the Buddha at Jetavana and 
asked if one could, by travelling, reach the end of the world where there would 
be no birth, old age, death, etc. The Buddha said that such was not possible. 
The devaputta then confessed that he had, in a previous life, been a sage called 
Rohitassa, a Bhojaputta of great psychic powers, able in one stride to cross 
from the western ocean to the eastern. The Commentary (SA.i.92) adds that he 
would wash in the Anotatta Lake and go to eat in Uttarakuru. With such a stride, 
he had travelled for one hundred years, and yet failed to reach the worldâ€™s end, 
where there was no birth, old age, death, etc. That was true, agreed the Buddha; 
in this fathom long body is the world, its origin, its making and end, likewise 
the practice which leads to such end. S.i.61f.; repeated at A.ii.47f.</p>
