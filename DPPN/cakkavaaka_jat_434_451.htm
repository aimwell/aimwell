<p><b>1. Cakkavāka Jātaka (No.434)</b>.-A greedy 
crow, dissatisfied with the fish from the Ganges, flew to the Himālaya and 
there, seeing two golden-coloured geese (cakkavāka), asked what they fed on that 
they should be so beautiful. The geese replied that not food but character made 
people comely; the crow was too greedy ever to be beautiful.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
greedy monk who went from house to house in search of dainty food, frequenting 
the dwellings of the rich. The monk is identified with the crow. J.iii.520-4; 
cf. <a href="kaaka_jat_140_146_395.htm" title="ka/kaaka_jat_140_146_395.htm">Kāka Jātaka</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Cakkavāka Jātaka (No.451).</b>-Similar to 
the above. The reason given for the colour of the crow was that his heart was 
full of fear and sin and that he had done evil in past lives. The greedy monk 
always went about looking for invitations. J.iv.70-2.</p>
