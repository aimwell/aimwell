<p>An isolated rock in Ceylon. It was evidently named after 
the senāpati Subha, who built a fortress there in the time of Māgha 
(Cv.lxxxi.3). </p>
<p>Later, it was occupied by Bhuvanekabāhu (brother of 
Vijayabāhu IV.), and formed the centre of the campaign in the battle of 
Vijayabāhu IV. against Candabhānu. </p>
<p>Later, Bhuvanekabāhu continued to live there 
(Cv.lxxxviii.26, 61, 64 f., 79). After Vijayabāhu IV. was killed by his senāpati 
Mitta, Bhuvanekabāhu, who had succeeded to the throne at Jambuddoni, had once 
more to seek refuge in Subhagiri, and for some time it was the seat of 
government. A town seems to have grown up there in the same way as at Sīhagiri 
(Cv.xc.11, 28, 30, 35).</p>
<p>Bhuvanekabāhu himself ruled there for eleven years 
(Cv.xc.42). After his death, Ariyacakkavatti laid waste the town (Cv.xc.45), and 
the capital was later moved to Hatthigiri(sela)pura (Cv.xc.59).</p>
<p>Subhagiri is identified with the modern Yāpahu, near Maho. 
Cv.Trs.ii.135, n.3.</p>
