<p>The Majjhima Commentary contains a 
reference to a king of Ceylon bearing this name. He visited the Chief Elder of 
the Mahāvihāra when all the other monks were away, in order to test him. The 
Elder had very weak eyes, but when the king touched his feet as would a snake, 
he remained unafraid and asked who was there. The story is related to show that 
arahants know no fear. MA.ii.869.</p>
