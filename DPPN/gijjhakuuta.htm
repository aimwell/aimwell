  <h2>Gijjhakūta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the five hills encircling 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. It was evidently a favourite resort of those who followed the 
religious life. (It was so even in times gone by, see, e.g., J.ii.55). </p>
<p>The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> seems to have been attracted 
by its solitude, and is mentioned as having visited it on several occasions, 
sometimes even in the dark, in drizzling rain, while <a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a> made unsuccessful 
attempts to frighten him (S.i.109).</p>
<p>It was on the 
slopes of Gijjhakūta, where the Buddha was wandering about, that 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> 
hurled at him a mighty stone to kill him, but only a splinter injured his foot 
(Vin.ii.193, etc.).</p>
<p>It was there also that <a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka Komāra-bhacca</a> administered a 
purgative to the Buddha (AA.i.216). </p>
<p>Among those who visited the Buddha on Gijjhakūta are mentioned: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p><a href="sahampati.htm" title="sa/sahampati.htm">Sahampati</a> (S.i.153), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the youth <a href="maagha.htm" title="ma/maagha.htm">Māgha</a> (Sn., p.86), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the Yakkha <a href="inda.htm" title="i_/inda.htm">Inda</a> (S.i.206), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> (S.i.233; iv.102), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the Paribbājaka <a href="s2_sal.htm#Sajjha" title="s/s2_sal.htm#Sajjha">Sajjha</a> 
(A.iv.371), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the <a href="kassapagotta.htm" title="ka/kassapagotta.htm">Kassapagotta</a> monk (A.i.237), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="pancasikha.htm" title="pa/pancasikha.htm">Pañcasikha</a> (S.iv.103; D.ii.220), 
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="sutavaa.htm" title="s/sutavaa.htm">Sutavā</a> (A.iv.369), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the four kings of the <a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world and their 
followers (D.iii.195), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="abhayaraajakumaara_s.htm" title="am/abhayaraajakumaara_s.htm">Abhayarājakumāra</a> (S.v.126), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="upaka.htm" title="u/upaka.htm">Upaka Mandikāputta</a> 
(A.ii.181), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="dhammika.htm" title="d/dhammika.htm">Dhammika</a> (A.iii.368), and </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="vassakaara.htm" title="va/vassakaara.htm">Vassakāra</a> (A.iv.18; D.ii.72). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Several 
well-known suttas were preached on Gijjhakūta — e.g., the 
<a href="maagha.htm" title="ma/maagha.htm">Māgha</a>, <a href="dhammika_v_s.htm" title="d/dhammika_v_s.htm">Dhammika</a> and 
<a href="chalabhijaatiya_s.htm" title="c/chalabhijaatiya_s.htm">Chalabhijāti</a> Suttas, the discourse on the seven 
<a href="aparihaaniya_s.htm" title="ay/aparihaaniya_s.htm">Aparihānīyadhammā</a> (A.iv.21f.), 
the <a href="mahasaropama_s.htm" title="maha/mahasaropama_s.htm">Mahāsāropama</a> and 
<a href="aataanaatiya_s.htm" title="aa/aataanaatiya_s.htm">Ātānātiya</a> Suttas. (See also S.ii.155, 185, 190, 241; 
iii.121; A.ii.73; iii.21; iv.160). </p>
<p>It is said (AA.i.412) that in due course a 
vihāra was erected on Gijjhakūta for the Buddha and his monks; here cells were 
erected for the use of monks who came from afar, but these cells were so 
difficult of access that monks arriving late at Rājagaha would ask 
<a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabbamallaputta-Tissa</a> to find accommodation for them in Gijjhakūta, in order to 
test his capabilities (Vin.ii.76; DhA.iii.321f). </p>
<p>Mention is made of several 
eminent monks who stayed at Gijjhakūta from time to time — e.g., </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> 
(M.iii.263; A.iii.300; S.ii.155), </li>
  <li><a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> (A.iii.383), </li>
  <li><a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>, </li>
  <li><a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a>, </li>
  <li><a href="punna.htm" title="pu/punna.htm">Punna Mantāniputta</a>, </li>
  <li><a href="upaali.htm" title="u/upaali.htm">Upāli</a> and <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">
  Devadatta</a> (S.ii.155),</li>
  <li><a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Cunda</a> and <a href="channa.htm" title="c/channa.htm">Channa</a> 
(S.iv.55). </li>
</ul>
<p>Channa fell ill there, and ultimately committed suicide. (Another 
monk is mentioned as having thrown himself down from Gijjhakūta because he was 
discontented with his life, Vin.iii.82. According to one account, AA.i.146f, 
Vakkali, too, committed suicide by throwing himself from Gijjhakūta; but see 
<a href="vakkali.htm" title="va/vakkali.htm">Vakkali</a>). </p>
<p><a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> and
<a href="lakkhana.htm" title="l/lakkhana.htm">Lakkhana</a> are reported to 
have stayed there, and to have seen many inhabitants of Rājagaha reborn in 
Gijjhakūta as petas (S.ii.254; Vin.iii.104; for Moggallāna see also A.iv.75). 
 
</p>
<p>The <a href="mettiyabhummajaka.htm" title="me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka.htm">Mettiya-bhummajakas</a> (Vin.iii.167) and the 
<a href="chabbaggiyaa.htm" title="c/chabbaggiyaa.htm">Chabbaggiyas</a> (ibid., 82) were also 
in the habit of visiting the hill.</p>
<p>Several places are mentioned as having 
been visited by the Buddha during his sojourns on Gijjhakūta, and it may be 
inferred from accounts given of these visits that these places were within easy 
reach of the hill. Such, for example, are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>the Patibhānakūta (S.v.448),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the <a href="sitavana.htm" title="s/sitavana.htm">Sītavana</a>, where the Buddha went to visit 
<a href="sona.htm" title="s/sona.htm">Sona</a> (A.iii.374),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the river <a href="sappini.htm" title="sa/sappini.htm">Sappinī</a>, on 
the banks of which lived various <a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājakas</a>, including 
<a href="sarabha.htm" title="sa/sarabha.htm">Sarabha</a> (A.i.185; 
ii.29, 176),  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the Paribbājakārama of <a href="udumbarikaa.htm" title="u/udumbarikaa.htm">Udumbarikā</a>,  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the residence of <a href="nigrodha.htm" title="n/nigrodha.htm">Nigrodha</a>, near 
the <a href="moranivapa.htm" title="me_mu/moranivapa.htm">Moranivāpa</a> on the bank of the lake <a href="sumaagadhaa.htm" title="s/sumaagadhaa.htm">Sumāgadhā</a> (D.iii.39), and  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the park <a href="maddakucci.htm" title="ma/maddakucci.htm">Maddakucchi</a>, where the Buddha was removed after the injury to his foot 
(DhA.ii.164).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The <a href="suukarakhatalena.htm" title="s/suukarakhatalena.htm">Sūkara-khatalena</a> was on the slope of Gijjhakūta, and there the 
Buddha was once visited by <a href="diighanakha.htm" title="d/diighanakha.htm">Dīghanakha</a> (S.v.233; M.i.497).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka’s</a> mango-grove 
lay between Gijjhakūta and the walls of Rājagaha (DA.i.150).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Gijjhakūta was so called, either 
because its peak was like a vulture’s beak, or because it was the resort of many 
vultures (SNA.ii.417; AA.i.412; MA.i.291, etc). </p>
<p>Cunningham (CAGI.534), on the authority 
of both Fa Hien and <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a>, identifies Gijjhakūta with the modern 
Sailagiri, about two and a half miles to the north-east of the old town. It is 
also called Giriyek Hill. Gijjhakūta is sometimes referred to as Gijjhapabbata 
(J.ii.50; iii.255, 484) and as Gijjha. J.vi.204, 212.</p>
