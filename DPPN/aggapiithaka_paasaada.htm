<p>A building in the inner city of 
Anurādhapura. </p>
<p>It is said that when Ilanāga entered the 
city in splendour, after the festival at the Tissa-tank, his chariot was drawn 
by his former enemies, the Lambakannas, who were yoked to the chariot, and that 
the line thus made extended from the tank to the Aggapīthaka-pāsāda. MT.646.</p>
