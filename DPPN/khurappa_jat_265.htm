<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a forester, head 
of five hundred others. They hired themselves out to guide men through the 
forest. One day, while conducting a caravan, robbers fell on them and all but 
the Bodhisatta fled; he remained and drove the robbers off. When asked how he 
could do this, he replied that he who would do heroic deeds must contemn life.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk who had lost energy in his duties (J.ii.335f).</p>
