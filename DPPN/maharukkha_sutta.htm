<p>In him who contemplates enjoyment in things which make for 
grasping (upādana), craving grows with its consequent round of suffering, like 
juice which travels upwards from the roots of a tree. If he contemplates the 
misery of such things, craving ceases, like the growth of a tree which is cut in 
pieces and burnt to ashes. S.ii.87f.</p>
