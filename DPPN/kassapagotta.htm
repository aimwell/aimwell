<p>1. Kassapagotta.-Apparently the general 
name given to those belonging to the family of Kassapas. Thus the Ājīvaka Guna 
is addressed as Kassapagotta (J.vi.222) and again as Kassapa (J.vi.224, 229, 
235). See also <a href="kassapa.htm#28" title="ka/kassapa.htm#28">Kassapa</a> (28).</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Kassapagotta.-A monk living in 
Vāsabhagāma in the Kāsi kingdom. He was in the habit of showing extreme 
hospitality to the monks who came there from other parts. Once some monks who 
visited him enjoyed his hospitality and stayed on. After some time, feeling that 
they had outstayed their welcome, Kassapagotta grew tired of looking after them 
and was blamed by them for his neglect. He therefore went to Campā, where he 
laid his case before the Buddha, who declared that no blame attached to him. 
Vin.i.312ff.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Kassapagotta.-A monk living in 
Pankadhā in the Kosala country. He heard the Buddha preach a sermon, but was not 
satisfied with it and kept on thinking: “This recluse” (meaning the Buddha) “is 
much too scrupulous” (adhisallikhat'evāyam). Later, he was filled with remorse 
and, having sought the Buddha at Rājagaha, begged forgiveness for his 
thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>The Buddha praised him for having seen 
his transgression, and for his confession thereof and determination to practise 
self-restraint. A.i.236f</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Kassapagotta.-A monk, perhaps to be 
identified with one of the foregoing. He was once staying in a forest tract in 
Kosala and, seeing a trapper pursuing deer, intervened and protested against the 
man’s earning his living by such cruel means. The trapper was too preoccupied 
with his quarry to pay much attention to what was said. A deva of the forest 
drew near the monk and instructed him not to waste his time in preaching to a 
man who heard but did not understand what was being said. Kassapa was agitated 
and, according to the Commentary, gave himself up to much striving and became an 
arahant. S.i.198f; SA.i.223.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="5">5</a>. Kassapagotta.-One of the monks who 
accompanied the <a href="majjhima_th.htm" title="ma/majjhima_th.htm">Thera Majjhima</a> on his journey to the country of the Himālaya for 
the purpose of converting it to Buddhism (Dpv.viii.10; Sp.i.68; Mbv.115; 
MT.317).  </p>
<p>In a relic-urn, found in Tope No.2 of Sāñchi group, were the ashes of 
this monk, where he is described as “Hemavatācariya.” Cunningham: Bhilsā Topes, 
287.</p>
