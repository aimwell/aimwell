<p>(Also called Nigrodha Jātaka.) Once the Bodhisatta was 
born as king of the deer and was called Nigrodha. With him was the leader of 
another herd, and he was called Sākha. There was an agreement between these two 
leaders that, on alternate days, a deer from their herd should offer itself to 
be killed by the king of Benares. One day the turn fell on a pregnant doe of 
Sākha’s herd, and when she asked to be allowed to wait until she had brought 
forth her young she was refused by Sākha. She then appealed to Nigrodha, who 
took her turn on himself. Immunity had been granted to Nigrodha, and when his 
act was reported to the king, he came in person to enquire into the matter. On 
hearing the story, he was greatly moved, and promised immunity both to Nigrodha 
and the doe. But Nigrodha was not satisfied till the king promised immunity to 
all living beings. Later, on discovering that the deer, taking advantage of 
this, were destroying men’s crops, Nigrodha, gave orders to his herd to refrain 
from doing so.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the mother of Kumāra 
Kassapa (q.v.). She had joined the Order under Devadatta not knowing that she 
was pregnant. On discovering her condition, Devadatta expelled her from the 
Order. She appealed to the Buddha, who caused an enquiry to be held, and, having 
been assured of her innocence, he restored her to all honour. When Kumāra 
Kassapa was born he, too, was admitted to the Order.</p>
<p>Devadatta is identified with Sākha, Kumāra Kassapa with 
the doe’s young one, his mother with the doe, and the king with Ānanda. 
</p>
<p>J.i.145ff.; DhA.iii.148f. The story is figured in the 
Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham: pl. xxv. (1) and xliii. (2). It is given in Mtu. 
(i.359ff.) with several variations in detail.</p>
