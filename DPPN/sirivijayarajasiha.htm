<p>King of Ceylon (1739-47 A.C.). He was Narinda-sīhā’s 
brother in law and succeeded him. His wives came from Madhurā and be reigned in 
Sirivaddhanapura. He had great regard for Saranankara Sāmanera (q.v.), and 
invited him to write a commentary on the Catu-Bhānavāra. He held a great 
festival in honour of the Tooth Relic, erected images in Alokalena, and with the 
help of the Olandā (Dutch), he sent an embassy to Siam (Sāminda) to fetch monks 
from Ayojjhā, but died before they arrived. Cv.xcviii.2ff.</p>
