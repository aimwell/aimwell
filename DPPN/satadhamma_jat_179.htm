  <h2>Satadhamma Jātaka (No. 179)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in the lowest caste, and one 
day went on a journey, taking his food in a basket. On the way he met a young 
man from Benares, Satadhamma, a magnifico. They travelled together, and when the 
time came for the meal, because Satadhamma had no food, the Bodhisatta offered 
him some. “I could not possibly take yours,” said the magnifico, “because you 
are the lowest of the low.” The Bodhisatta ate some of the food and put the rest 
away. In the evening they bathed, and the Bodhisatta ate without offering 
Satadhamma anything. The latter had expected to be asked again and was very 
hungry. But finding that he was offered nothing, he asked the Bodhisatta for 
some and ate it. As soon as he had finished he was seized with remorse that he 
should thus have disgraced his family. So greatly was he upset that he vomited 
the food, and with it some blood. He plunged into the wood and was never heard 
of again.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to monks who earned 
their living in the twenty one unlawful ways, as physicians, messengers, etc. 
The Buddha summoned them and warned that food unlawfully come by was like red 
hot iron, a deadly poison. It was like partaking of the leavings of the vilest 
of mankind. J.ii.82 5.</p>
