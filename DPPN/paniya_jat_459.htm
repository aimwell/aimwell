  <h2>Pānīya Jātaka (No. 459)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story of how six persons became Pacceka Buddhas by 
feeling remorse for sins committed and by developing supernatural insight. The 
Jātaka derives its name from the first of these, who was a villager of Kāsi. He 
went with his friend into the fields, each carrying a flask of water. From time 
to time they drank, but the first drank out of the other’s flask, wishing to 
save the water in his own. In the evening remorse seized him, and as he stood 
reflecting on his wickedness he became a Pacceka Buddha.</p>
<p>The Pacceka Buddhas met at Nandamūlapabbhāra and together 
visited the king of Benares who was the Bodhisatta. On hearing their stories he 
renounced the world, and, in spite of the efforts of his consort to stop him, 
became an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to five hundred 
householders of Sāvatthi who became monks. They lived in the monastery but 
indulged in thoughts of sin. The Buddha sent Ānanda to summon them, and 
admonished them saying that no matter how small a sin it was, it must be checked 
(J.iv.113ff). The queen consort of the story was Rāhulamātā.</p>
