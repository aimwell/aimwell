<p><b>1. Revata.</b> The fifth of the twenty four Buddhas.  </p>
<p>He was born in Sudhaññaka (Sudhaññavatī), his father being the khattiya Vipula and his mother 
Vipulā. For six thousand years he lived in the household and then renounced the 
world, travelling in a chariot, leaving his wife Sudassanā and their son Varuna. 
The three palaces occupied by him in his lay life were Sudassana, Ratanagghi and 
Āvela. He practiced austerities for seven months and attained Enlightenment 
under a Nāga tree, having been given milk rice by Sādhudevī and grass for his 
seat by the Ājīvaka Varunindhara. His first sermon was preached at Varunārāma. 
 
</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta was a brahmin of Rammavatī, named Atideva, who, seeing the 
Buddha, spoke his praises in one thousand verses. Among the Buddha’s converts 
was King Arindama of Uttaranagara. The Buddha’s chief disciples were Varuna and 
Brahmadeva among monks and Bhaddā and Subhaddā among nuns. His constant 
attendant was Sambhava. His chief lay patrons were Paduma and Kuñjara, and 
Sirimā and Yasavatī. His body was eighty hands in height, and his aura spread 
uninterruptedly to a distance of one yojana. He died in the Mahāsāra pleasance 
at the age of sixty thousand, and his relics were scattered. Bu.vi.1ff.; 
BuA.131ff.; J.i.30, 35, 44.</p>

<p><b>2. Revata. </b>A monk, the personal attendant of Siddhattha Buddha. 
Bu.xvii.18; J.i.40.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Revata </b>(called <b><a name="Khadiravaniya">Khadiravaniya</a></b>). An arahant Thera. An eminent 
disciple of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, declared by him foremost among forest dwellers (araññakānam) 
(A.i.24). He was the youngest brother of <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, and a marriage was arranged 
for him by his mother who was miserable at seeing her children desert her one 
after another to join the Order, and wished to keep the youngest at home. He was 
only seven years old, and, on the wedding day, the relations of both bride and 
bridegroom showered blessings on the couple and said to the bride: “May you live 
as long as your grandmother.” Revata asked to see the grandmother, and was shown 
a woman of one hundred and twenty, decrepit, and showing all the signs of 
advanced old age. Realizing that his wife would probably share the same fate, he 
left the bridal procession on some pretext on the way home, and ran away to a 
place where some monks lived. Sāriputta, foreseeing this, had instructed the 
monks to ordain his brother without reference to his parents, and, when Revata 
revealed his identity, the monks at once admitted him into the Order.</p>
<p>When Sāriputta heard this, he wished to visit his brother, but was persuaded 
by the Buddha to wait. Revata, after waiting a long time for the visit from 
Sāriputta, obtained from his teachers a formula of meditation and himself set 
out to see the Buddha. On the way he stopped at a khadiravana (acacia forest) 
during the rainy season and there won arahantship.</p>
<p>At the end of the rains the Buddha, accompanied by Sāriputta and 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>, with 
five hundred other monks, started out to visit Revata.</p>
<p>There were two routes leading to the khadiravana, of which the shorter was 
thirty leagues long, straight, but infested with evil spirits. This the Buddha 
chose because <a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sīvalī Thera</a> was in the company of monks, and the Buddha 
knew that the deities of the forest would provide the monks with all they needed 
because of Sīvalī’s presence. When Revata knew that the Buddha was approaching, 
he created, by his magic power, splendid dwellings for him and his monks. The 
Buddha spent two months in the forest and then returned to the Pubbārāma in 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. There he found that <a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a> had heard contradictory accounts of 
the dwelling erected by Revata for the monks who had accompanied the Buddha. He 
dispelled Visākhā’s doubts and spoke of Revata’s powers. DhA.ii.188ff.; it was 
on this occasion that the Buddha related the story of Sivalī’s past; see also 
DhA.iv.186f.  </p>
<p>One of the stanzas (No. 212), of the Muni Sutta was also preached 
to the monks, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.i.261f.), in connection with Revata. 
This was immediately after the Buddha’s talk to Visākhā, mentioned above. The 
story of Revata’s ordination is also given at AA.i.126ff., with some variations 
in detail. The account given in ThagA.i.108ff. is much shorter; no mention is 
made of the Buddha’s visit to the khadiravana. Here it is said that, after 
winning arahantship, Revata went to Sāvatthi to greet the Buddha and Sāriputta.</p>
<p>Some time after, Revata returned to his native village and brought away with 
him his three nephews, sons of his three sisters, <a href="caalaa.htm" title="c/caalaa.htm">Cālā</a>, 
<a href="upacaalaa.htm" title="u/upacaalaa.htm">Upacālā</a> and 
<a href="sisupacala_theri.htm">Sisūpacālā</a>. 
Sāriputta heard of this and went to see Revata. Revata knowing that he was coming, exhorted his nephews to be particularly heedful, and Sāriputta expressed 
his pleasure at their behaviour. ThagA.i.110; his admonitory verse is given at 
Thag.vs.43; two verses uttered by Sāriputta in praise of Revata are given at 
Thag.vss.991-2.</p>
<p>The ThagA.i.551f&nbsp; mentions another incident which took place during 
Revata’s old age. He was in the habit of visiting the Buddha and Sāriputta from 
time to time after returning to his home in the khadiravana. Once, during a 
visit to Sāvatthi, he stayed in a forest near the city. The police, on the track 
of some thieves, came upon him, and, finding him near the booty which the 
thieves had dropped in their flight, arrested him and brought him before the 
king. When the king questioned him, the Elder spoke a series of verses (Thag.646 
58; Mrs. Rhys Davids speaks of Revata as a teacher of the Jain doctrine of 
ahimsā, Gotama the Man, p.116), demonstrating the impossibility of his 
committing such an act, and also by way of teaching the king the Dhamma. It is 
said (ThagA.l.555) that at the conclusion of the stanzas he sat cross legged in 
the sky until his body burnt itself out.</p>
<p>Revata loved solitude, and, on one occasion (DhA.iii.325f), a lay disciple 
named Atula, hearing that he was in Sāvatthi, went with five hundred others to 
hear him preach. But Revata said that he delighted in solitude and refused to 
address them, and Atula went away complaining.</p>
<p>Revata’s delight in solitude was sometimes misunderstood. For instance, the 
Elder Sanunñjani went about continually sweeping, and, seeing Revata sitting 
cross legged, thought him an idler. Revata read his thoughts and admonished him.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Revata was a boatman at Payāga on the 
Ganges, and once took the Buddha and his thousand followers across the river in 
a boat decked with canopies, flowers, etc. On that occasion he heard the Buddha 
declare one of the monks highest among forest dwellers, and wished for a similar 
honour for himself under a future Buddha (ThagA.i.108; A.A.i.126). Later, he was 
born in deva worlds. Fifty eight kappas ago he was a king named Tārana, and a 
kappa later another king named Campaka. Ap.i.51f.</p>

<p><b><a name="4">4</a>. Revata. </b>The DhpA.iv.176f&nbsp; mentions a novice Revata, with three 
others&nbsp;-&nbsp; <a href="sankicca.htm" title="sa/sankicca.htm">Sankicca</a>, 
<a href="pandita.htm" title="pa/pandita.htm">Pandita</a> and <a href="sopaka.htm" title="s/sopaka.htm">Sopāka</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp; all four of whom 
became arahants at the age of seven. The Revata referred to is, very probably, 
the Revata (3) above. For their story see <a href="pancachiddageha.htm" title="pa/pancachiddageha.htm">Pañcachiddageha</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>6. Revata.</b> Called <b>Soreyya Revata</b>. He was one of the Elders who took a 
prominent part in the Second Council.</p>
<p>He lived in <a href="soreyya.htm" title="s/soreyya.htm">Soreyya</a>, and, on discovering 
(by means of his divine ear) that the orthodox monks, led by 
<a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta Sānavāsī</a> 
and   <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa Kākandakaputta</a>, were anxious to consult him, Revata left Soreyya, and, 
travelling through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara and Aggalapura, reached 
Sahajāti. There the monks met him and consulted him regarding the “Ten Points.” 
 
</p>
<p>He enquired into these, and, after condemning them as wrong, decided to end the 
dispute. The <a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjiputtakas</a>, too, had tried to win Revata over to their 
side, but on failing to do so, persuaded Revata’s pupil, 
<a href="uttara.htm" title="u/uttara.htm">Uttara</a>, to accept 
robes, etc., from them, and speak to his teacher on their behalf. Uttara did 
this, but was dismissed by Revata as an unworthy pupil.</p>
<p>Revata suggested that the dispute should be settled in Vesāli, and the monks 
having agreed, he visited <a href="sabbakama.htm" title="sa/sabbakama.htm">Sabbakāmī</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp; who was the oldest monk then 
living and a pupil of Ānanda (according to Mhv.iv.57, 60, Revata, himself was a 
pupil of Ānanda and had seen the Buddha; cp. Dpv.iv.49)&nbsp;-&nbsp; during the 
night, and talked to him on matters of doctrine. During the conversation, Sānavāsī arrived and questioned Sabbakāmī regarding the Ten Points, but the 
latter refused to express an opinion in private. On Revata’s suggestion a jury 
of eight, four from either side, was appointed to go into the question. Revata 
himself was a member of this jury, and he it was who questioned Sabbakāmī during 
the meeting, held in Vālikārāma, regarding the Ten Points. All the Ten Points 
were declared to be wrong, and, at the end of the questions, seven hundred monks&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
chosen from one hundred and twelve thousand, at the head of whom was Revata&nbsp;-&nbsp; 
held a recital of the Dhamma, which recital therefore came to be called Sattasatī (“Seven Hundred”). This recital, according to the Mhv., lasted for 
eight months.</p>
<p>Vin.ii.299ff. The Mhv.iv.1ff gives an account of this Council, which account 
differs in numerous details. In both accounts it is Revata who takes the most 
prominent part in settling the dispute. The Mhv. introduces 
<a href="kaalaasoka.htm" title="ka/kaalaasoka.htm">Kālāsoka</a> as 
the patron of the Second Council; cp. Dpv.iv.46ff.; v.15ff.; Sp.i.33f.; it would 
appear from the Dpv. account that the heretics refused to accept the decision of 
Revata’s Council and separated off, to the number of ten thousand, forming a new 
body called the <a href="mahasanghika.htm" title="maha/mahasanghika.htm">Mahāsanghikas</a>.</p>

<p><b>7. Revata. </b>An Elder of Ceylon. He was a Majjhimabhānaka, and, once, 
going to Revata (8) who lived in the Malaya country of Ceylon, he asked him for 
a subject of meditation. The latter knowing that the former was a Majjhimabānake 
spoke to him of the difficulties facing such a one in meditation. The other at 
once agreed not to recite the Majjhima until his meditations should prove 
fruitful. He was given a topic of meditation, and attained arahantship nineteen 
years later. But when, at the end of that time, he again started to recite the 
Majjhima, he was never in doubt as to a single consonant. Vsm.i.95.</p>
<p><b>8. Revata.</b> An Elder of Ceylon, living in the Malaya country of Ceylon. 
See Revata (7).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Revata.</b> Teacher of Buddhaghosa. He was very proficient in the 
Vedas, and, when Buddhaghosa visited him in his vihāra and recited the Vedas, he 
was able to speak with contempt of Buddhaghosa’s knowledge. Buddhaghosa then 
became his pupil, and was later sent by him to Ceylon to translate the 
Singhalese Commentaries into Pāli. Cv.xxxvii.218ff.</p>
