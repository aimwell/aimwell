<p>A grove near <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> where 
<a href="anaathapindika.htm" title="ay/anaathapindika.htm">Anāthapindika</a> first met 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. In the grove was a cemetery described as bhayabherava (ThagA.i.47; 
cf. Dvy.264, 268), and, when Anāthapindika approached it, he was filled with 
fear and trembling. But he was reassured by a friendly Yakkha, 
<a href="sivaka.htm" title="s/sivaka.htm">Sīvaka</a> 
(Vin.ii.155f.; when the Buddha was staying there, Māra asked him to die; 
D.ii.116).</p>
<p>In the Sītavana was the <a href="sappasondika.htm" title="sa/sappasondika.htm">Sappasondikapabbhāra</a> (S.i.210f; 
Vin.ii.76; iv.159), where Upasena was killed by a snake bite (S.iv.40) and 
<a href="sona.htm" title="s/sona.htm">Sona 
Kolivisa</a> tried, without success, to practise asceticism.
(A.iii.374). </p>
<p><a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta Thera</a> so loved the Sītavana that he came 
to be called “Sitavaniya.” </p>
<p>In Asoka’s day his brother Tissakumāra, (Ekavihāriya) is 
also mentioned its delighting in the solitude of Sītavana (Thag.vs.540; or does 
this Sītavana not refer to any particular place?). </p>
<p>There were five hundred “walks” (cankamanāni) in Sītavana. 
AA.ii.679.</p>
