<p><b>1. Sonuttara Thera. </b>An arahant. He lived in the 
Pūjā-parivena in the Mahāvihāra and was entrusted by Dutthagāmanī with the task 
of finding relics for the Mahā Thūpa. In the time of the Buddha he had been the 
brahmin Nanduttara, and had entertained the Buddha on the occasion on which, at 
Payāgatittha, Bhaddaji Thera had raised, from the bed of the Ganges, the palace 
he had occupied as Mahāpanāda. Filled with marvel, Nanduttara wished that he 
might have the power of procuring relics possessed by others. Sonuttara visited 
the Mañjerika-nāga-bhavana and asked the Nāga king, Mahākāla, to give him the 
relics which he had there and which had once been enshrined in Rāmagāma. But 
Mahākāla, unwilling to part with them, told his nephew, Vāsuladatta, to hide 
them. Sonuttara knew this, and when Mahākāla told him he might take the relics 
if he could find them, Sonuttara, by his magic power, took the relic casket from 
Vāsuladatta, unknown to him, and brought it to Anurādhapura, where the relics 
were deposited in the Mahā Thūpa. Mhv.xxxi.4-74.</p>
