  <h2>Kandari Jātaka (No.341)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Kandari, a king of Benares, was very 
handsome; each day he received one thousand boxes of perfume for his use, and 
his food was cooked with scented wood. His wife, Kinnarā, was very beautiful; 
his chaplain was Pañcālacanda. One day, Kinnarā, on looking out, saw a loathsome 
cripple in the shade of a jambu-tree near her window, and conceived a passion 
for the man. Thereafter she would wait for the king to fall asleep and would 
then, nightly, visit the cripple, taking him dainty foods and having her 
pleasure with him. One day the king, returning from a procession, saw the 
misshapen creature, and asked the chaplain if such a man could ever win the love 
of a woman. The cripple, hearing the question, proudly boasted of his intimacy 
with the queen. At the chaplain’s suggestion the king watched the queen’s 
movements that same night, and saw the cripple abuse her and strike her for 
being late in coming. The blow fell on her ear breaking off her ear ornament, 
which the king picked up.</p>
<p>The next day he ordered the queen to 
appear before him in all her ornaments, and having proved that he knew of her 
infidelity, handed her over to the chaplain to be executed. Pañcālacanda, 
pitying the woman, begged that she should be pardoned, because in being unchaste 
she had but obeyed the instincts common to all women. To prove his contention, 
Pañcālacanda took the king with him and, in disguise, they wandered through 
Jambudīpa, testing the virtue of various women, including that of a young bride 
who was being taken to her husband’s house. Convinced that all women were alike, 
the king spared Kinnarā’s life, but drove her out of the palace together with 
the cripple, and caused the jambu-tree to be cut down.</p>
<p>The story was among those related by the 
bird Kunāla to his friend Punnamukha, testifying to the unfaithfulness of women. 
Kunāla is identified with Pañcālacanda. J.v.437-40; J.iii.132.</p>
