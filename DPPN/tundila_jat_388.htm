  <h2>Tundila Jātaka (No.388)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a pig 
and had a brother. They were adopted by an old woman of a village near Benares 
and were called Mahātundila and Cullatundila. </p>
<p>The woman loved them like her own 
children and refused to sell them, but, one day, some lewd men made her drunk 
and she agreed to sell Cullatundila. When Cullatundila discovered this, he ran 
to his brother, but the latter preached to him how it was the fate of pigs to be 
slaughtered for their flesh; he should, therefore, meet his death bravely. All 
Benares heard the Bodhisatta’s preaching, and flocked to the spot. The king 
adopted the pigs as his sons and Mahātundila was appointed to the seat of 
judgment. On the king’s death, he wrote a book of law for the guidance of future 
generations.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk who was in constant terror of the thought of death. The monk was identified 
with Cullatundila (J.iii.286ff).</p>
<p>It is said (DhA.i.83) that the lewd men 
were identical with the Bhaddavaggiyā. Having heard Mahātundila preach the five 
precepts, they observed them for sixty thousand years, hence their attainment of 
arahantship as in their last birth.</p>
<p>Mahātundila’s preaching is referred to 
as the Tundilovāda.</p>
