<p>The Thapati of Pasenadi, king of Kosala. He was a devoted 
follower of the Buddha and loved discussion. </p>
<p>The Bahuvedaniya Sutta (M.i.396ff.; see also S.iv.223f) is 
based on a discussion between him and Mahā Udāyi, which discussion Ānanda 
overheard and repeated to the Buddha. On another occasion, Pañcakanga related to 
the Buddha the conversation he had had with the Paribbājaka Uggāhamāna 
Samanamandikāputta, and the Buddha preached to him the Samanamandikā Sutta 
(M.ii.23ff). </p>
<p>The Anuruddha Sutta (M.iii.144ff) contains a discussion 
between Anuruddha and Abhiya Kaccāna, which took place at Pañcakanga’s house, 
whither he had invited them. The discussion was started by a question asked by 
Pañcakanga. Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.629; SA.iii.86) that Pañcakanga was the 
Thapati’s personal name, and that he was so called (“Five tools”) because he 
carried the five tools of a carpenter: vāsīpharasu (adze), nikhādana (chisel), 
danda (measuring stick), muggara (gavel), and kālasutta (blackened thread). He 
explains Thapati by vaddhakī jettha.</p>
