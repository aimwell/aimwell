<p>A brahmin of Sāvatthi. Once when the 
Buddha was ill with cramp and desired hot water Upavāna obtained from Devahita 
hot water and molasses, which he sent on a pingo by a serving man. Hot 
fomentations and the administering of molasses cured the Buddha’s complaint. 
Devahita came later to the Buddha, and after some conversation he was converted 
(S.i.174f; DhA.iv.232). Devahita was said to be a friend of Upavāna 
(ThagA.i.311f).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.201) adds 
that Devahita earned his living from the provision of water heated on his row of 
ovens and of cosmetics for those who came to bathe. On hearing of the Buddha’s 
illness, he gave to Upavāna a kind of treacle to be administered in water.</p>
