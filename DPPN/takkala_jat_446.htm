<p>Once in a village lived a man called 
Vasitthaka, an only son, who looked after his father with great devotion, until 
the latter, much against the wishes of his son, found a wife for him. A son was 
born to the pair and, when seven years old, he overheard his mother planning to 
have the old man taken by a ruse to the cemetery and there killed and buried in 
a pit. The next morning, when his father set out in a cart for the cemetery, the 
child insisted on accompanying him. Having watched his father dig a pit, he 
asked what it was for, and was told that the useless old man was a burden to 
keep and that the pit was for him. The boy was silent, and when his father 
stopped to have a rest, he took up the spade and began to dig another hole. On 
being asked the reason, he said it was for his father when he should be too old 
to be supported. This remark opened Vasitthaka’s eyes; he returned home and 
drove away his wife. He afterwards took her back on her promising to give up her 
treacherous ways.</p>
<p>The story was related to a man who had 
looked after his father; but the wife, whom he took at his father’s wish, wanted 
to get rid of the old man, and suggested the idea to her husband. But his answer 
was that if she found the house inconvenient she could go elsewhere. The Buddha 
said that the characters of both stories were identical, and that he himself was 
the lad of the atītavatthu. J.iv.43-50.</p>
