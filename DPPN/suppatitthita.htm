<p><b>1. Suppatitthita. </b>A ford, across the Nerañjarā, 
where the Buddha bathed just before eating the meal given by Sujātā. J.i.70; 
BuA.7.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Suppatitthita.</b> A nigrodha tree belonging to king 
Koravya. The king and his court ate the first portion of the fruit as big as 
pipkins and sweet; the army had the second portion, the town and country people 
the third, recluses and holy men the fourth, and birds and beasts the last. None 
guarded its fruit, and none would hurt another in order to obtain its fruit.</p>
<p>One day there came a man who ate his fill of the fruit, 
broke a branch, and went his way. The deva of the tree was angry, and the tree 
bore no more fruit. Koravya visited Sakka and consulted him. Sakka sent a squall 
to punish the deva and made the deva appear before him full of repentance. Then 
Sakka warned him to keep the Rukkhadhamma, which was that various people take 
and make use of various parts of a tree; it is not for the deva of the tree to 
mope and pine on that account. A.iii.369f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Suppatitthita.</b> The minister who traced the

a previous birth of Gosīsanikkhepa Thera. Ap.i.245.</p>
