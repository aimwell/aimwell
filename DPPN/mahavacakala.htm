<h2>Mahāvācakāla</h2>
<p>A man who lived on the banks of the Mahāvālukagangā. For 
thirty years he meditated on the thirty two impurities of the body in the hope 
of becoming a sotāpanna. But at the end of that period he gave up his 
meditations, renouncing the Buddha’s Doctrine as futile. </p>
<p>After death he was born as a crocodile in the river, and 
one day sixty carts laden with stone pillars started crossing the river at 
Kacchakatittha. The crocodile ate bulls, carts, and pillars. AA.i.367.</p>
