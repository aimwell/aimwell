<p><b>1. Dīgha-Kārāyana.</b>-Nephew of Bandhula, 
commander-in-chief of Pasenadi. After Bandhula’s death, Dīgha was appointed in 
his place and accompanied the king. Once, during their travels, they came to 
Nangaraka (Ulumpa says DhA.iii.356) and, hearing that the Buddha was at 
Medatalumpa, went to see him, but Dīgha stayed outside while the Buddha talked 
to Pasenadi (M.ii.118f; MA.ii.753f; J.iv.151). The Dhammapada Commentary 
(i.355ff) adds that Dīgha went about reviling the king for the murder of his 
uncle, and that when Pasenadi went in to the Buddha, leaving the royal insignia 
in Dīgha’s charge, the latter saw his chance of revenge. He left Pasenadi, 
hastened to Vidūdabha and crowned him king. He then returned to Sāvatthi, 
leaving for Pasenadi only a single horse and one female servant. It was this 
treachery which led to Pasenadi’s untimely death.</p>

<p><b>2. Dīgha-Kārāyana.</b>-A minister of Bhātiya 
(Bhātikābhaya?). He was a very learned brahmin and was appointed by the king to 
settle a dispute between the residents of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri, 
regarding the charge brought against Dabba-Mallaputta by the nun Mettiyā. He 
decided in favour of the Mahāvihāra residents (Sp.iii.583).</p>
