<h2>Mahāsatthivassa Thera</h2>
<p>A resident of Katthakasālā parivena. King Vasabha went to 
the monastery, as the monk lay dying, intending to worship him, but at the door 
he heard the groans of the ill man, and disgusted that, after sixty years of 
monastic life, he should not be able to conquer his pain, he did not enter. This 
was reported to the Elder, and putting forth great effort, he subdued his pain 
and sent word to the king to come to him. Vasabha entered, and prostrating 
himself before the Elder, said, “I worship you, not for your arahantship, but 
for the exertion you put forth while yet a puthujjana.” DA.i.291.</p>
