  <h2>Sanankumāra</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Mahā Brahmā. In the Nikāyas (D.i.121; M.i.358; S.i.153; 
A.v.327) he is mentioned as the author of a famous verse, there quoted:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>Khattiyo settho jane tasmim ye gottapatisārino 
  </dd>
  <dd>Vijjācaranasampanno so settho devamānuse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In one place (S.ii.284) the verse is attributed to the 
Buddha, thus endowing it with the authoritativeness of a pronouncement by the 
Buddha himself. Sanankumāra is represented as a very devout follower of the 
Buddha. </p>
<p>In a sutta of the Samyutta (S.i.153), he is spoken of as 
visiting the Buddha on the banks of the Sappinī, and it was during this visit 
that the above verse was spoken. Sanankumāra was present at the preaching of the 
Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.261). </p>
<p>In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the 
Buddha an occasion on which Sanankumāra attended an assembly of the Devas, 
presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods. There was suddenly a vast 
radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanankumāra. As the usual 
appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be 
perceived by the Devas of Tāvatimsa, he is forced to appear as a relatively 
gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in 
their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then 
Sanankumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha (because all devas like Pañcasikha, 
says the Commentary, DA.ii.640) and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in 
the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the 
Tāvatimsa Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight 
characteristics of a Brahmā’s voice. (These are given at D.ii.211). He then 
proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of 
a Tāvatimsa Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking 
refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Each deva fancies that only the 
shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then 
Sanankumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka’s throne, 
addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of iddhi; on the three avenues 
leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four satipatthānas, and 
the seven samādhiparikkhārā. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of 
Magadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born 
in the deva worlds. When Sanankumāra has finished his address, Vessavana wonders 
if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future. The Brahmā 
reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.</p>
<p>Sanankumāra means “ever young.” Buddhaghosa says 
(MA.ii.584; cf. SA.i.171) that, in his former birth, he practised jhānas while 
yet a boy with his hair tied in five knots (pañcacūlakakumārakāle), and was 
reborn in the Brahma world with the thāna intact. He liked the guise of youth 
and continued in the same, hence the name. Rhys Davids (Dial.ii.292, n.3; 
cf.i.121, n.1) sees in the legend of Sanankumāra the Indian counterpart of the 
European legend of Galahad. The oldest mention of it is in the Chāndogya 
Upanisad (Chap. VII), where the ideal, yet saintly knight, teaches a typical 
brahmin the highest truths. In the Mahābhārata (iii.185, Bombay Edition) he 
expresses a sentiment very similar to that expressed in the stanza quoted above. 
In mediaeval literature he is said to have been one of five or seven mind born 
sons of Brahma who remained pure and innocent. A later and debased Jaina version 
of the legend tells in detail of the love adventures and wives of this knight, 
with a few words at the end on his conversion to the saintly life. See 
J.R.A.S.1894, p. 344; 1897, p.585 f; Revue de, Histoire des Religions, 
vol.xxxi.pp.29ff.</p>

<p><b>Sanankumāra Sutta. </b>Brahmā Sanankumāra visits the 
Buddha on the banks of the Sappinī, and speaks a verse (S.i.153; for the verse 
see Sanankumāra) in praise of learning and good conduct. The Buddha approves of 
the sentiment contained in the verse.</p>
