</ul>
<p>A monk. He was a Sākyan and loved holding discussions with 
the heretics. When he suffered defeat at their hands, he would resort to 
falsehood and evasion, or would ask his opponent to and meet him somewhere and 
then go there before the appointed time and give it out that his opponent had 
avoided him. This matter was reported to the Buddha, who rebuked Hatthaka for 
his conduct. Vin.iv.1f.; cf. DhA.iii.390.</p>
