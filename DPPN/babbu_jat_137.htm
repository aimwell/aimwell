<p>There was once a rich merchant of <b>Kāsi</b> who amassed 
forty crores of gold. His wife died and, because of her love of money, was 
reborn as a mouse dwelling over the family treasure. In due course the rest of 
the family died and the village was deserted. The Bodhisiatta was a stone 
cutter, working a quarry near the mouse’s residence. She, liking him, brought 
him one day a coin, suggesting that, with a part of it, he should buy her some 
meat. The Bodhisatta agreed, and this continued for some time. One day the mouse 
was caught by a cat, but she obtained her release by promising him some of her 
food. She was later caught by three other cats, but was let free on the same 
terms. The mouse thus had only one fifth of her food and grew very thin. The 
Bodhisiatta noticed this, and when she told him the reason, he put her inside a 
crystal box and suggested that when the cats came she should refuse to have 
anything to do with them. The first cat arrived and, on being reviled by the 
mouse, jumped on the crystal box and was crushed to death. The same fate 
overtook the other cats. The mouse thus became free, and in gratitude to the 
Bodhisatta, showed him all the treasure.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to <b>Kānā</b> (q.v.), who 
lost her husband owing to four monks. The monks were the cats and Kānā the 
mouse. J.i.477 80.</p>
