  <h2>Sambula Jātaka (No. 519)</h2>
  </li>

<p>Sambulā was the wife of Sotthisena, king of Benares, whose 
father was the Bodhisatta. Sambulā was very beautiful, but when Sotthisena, 
being seized with leprosy, left his kingdom and went into the forest, she went 
with him and tended him with great devotion. One day, after fetching food from 
the forest, she went to bathe, and was drying herself, when she was seized by a 
Yakkha who threatened to carry her away.  </p>
<p>By her power Sakka’s throne was heated, 
and Sakka, coming with his thunderbolt, frightened the Yakkha and put him in 
chains. It was late when Sambulā returned home, and Sotthisena, wishing to test 
her love, refused to believe her story.  </p>
<p>She then performed an Act of Truth, 
declaring that she was faithful and sprinkled water on Sotthisena. He was 
completely healed, and together they went to Benares, where Sotthisena’s father 
was still king. He made Sotthisena king and became an ascetic. Sotthisena gave 
himself up to pleasure and neglected Sambulā. The ascetic, returning, found her 
thin and miserable and, learning the reason, admonished Sotthisena.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
<a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā’s</a> great 
devotion to her husband. She is identified with Sambulā and 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> with Sotthisena. J.v.88 98.</p>
