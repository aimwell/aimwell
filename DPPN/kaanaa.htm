  </li>
</ul>
<p>Daughter of Kānamātā. After she married 
she visited her mother, and one day, while she was there, her husband sent for 
her. Her mother, not wishing her to return empty-handed, asked her to wait till 
she had made some cakes. When the cakes were ready, a monk came to the door and 
Kānā gave him some. Four other monks came, and the cakes were finished. Four 
times Kānā’s husband sent for her and four times the same thing happened. So, in 
anger, the husband took another wife. Kānā, learning this, was so greatly 
annoyed that she reviled and abused every monk she saw until no monk dared go 
into her street. The Buddha, hearing of this, visited Kānā’s mother, and having 
finished his meal there, sent for Kānā, argued with her, and convinced her that 
the monks were not to blame inasmuch as they had only taken what was given them. 
At the end of the Buddha’s discourse Kānā became a sotāpanna. The king saw the 
Buddha returning from Kānā’s home and, on learning what had happened, sent for 
her, adopted her as his daughter, and arranged for her marriage with a rich 
nobleman. Thenceforward Kānā’s generosity to the monks became proverbial. 
Vin.iv.78f; DhA.ii.149ff; the Samantapāsādikā (iv.819) gives a somewhat 
different account; there, when Kānā’s husband heard that the Buddha had been to 
see her, he sent for her and she returned. </p>
<p>It was on Kānā’s account that the Babbu 
Jātaka (q.v.) (J.i.477f) was preached. Kānā is identified with the mouse of the 
story.</p>
<p>She was called Kānā because she was so 
beautiful that those who saw her became blind with passion for her (ye ye tam 
passanti, te te rāgena kānā honti) (Sp. loc. cit.).</p>
<p>Both Kānā and her mother are mentioned 
among those who kept the eightfold fast. A.iv.349; AA.ii.791.</p>
