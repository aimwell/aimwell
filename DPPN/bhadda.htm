<p><b>1. Bhadda.</b> A lay disciple of Nādikā who, the 
  Buddha declared, had destroyed the five orambhāgiyasamyojanā and had been born 
  in the highest deva worlds, thence to pass away entirely. D.ii.92.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhadda Thera.</b> He was born in the family of a setthi of Sāvatthi. His 
parents had gone to the Buddha before his conception, and had told him that if 
they had a child they would give him to the Buddha as his servant. When he was 
seven years old, they took him, arrayed in his best, to the Buddha, in 
fulfilment of their promise. The Buddha asked Ānanda to ordain him. This he did 
and instructed him, and the same night Bhadda became an arahant. The Buddha 
called to him saying, “Come, Bhadda,” and that was his upasampadā.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had offered hundreds 
of thousands of robes, etc., to the Buddha and his monks. Thag.vss.473-9; 
ThagA.i.474f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhadda Thera.</b> Perhaps to be identified with 
  Bhadda (2). He is mentioned as staying at the Kukkutārāma in Pātaliputta in 
  the company of Ānanda, with whom he discussed the righteous and the 
  unrighteous life (S.v.15f) and the cultivation of the satipatthānas. S.v.171f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhadda</b>. One of the two chief disciples of 
  Kondañña Buddha. J.i.30; Bu.iii.304.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Bhadda.</b> Commander in chief of Sena I. He 
  built the Bhaddasenāpatiparivenia and endowed it with servants and revenues. 
  Cv.l.82.</p>
