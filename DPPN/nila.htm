<h4>1. Nīla</h4>
<p>A friend of Mahinda I. He died early, and Mahinda refused 
the kingship out of sorrow for his friend. Cv.xlviii. 27ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nīla Thera</h4>
<p>He belonged to a family of flower sweepers. He joined the 
Order and became an arahant in the tonsure hall. When he came to Sāvatthi in 
search of a rag robe a Mahābrahmā saw him and stood worshipping him. Other 
brahmas heard of this, and all worshipped him. SA.ii.217.</p>
