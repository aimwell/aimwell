  <h2>IsidÄsÄ« TherÄ«</h2>

<p>She was the daughter of a good and 
wealthy merchant of <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">UjjenÄ«</a>. Having come of age, she was given in marriage to the 
son of a merchant in SÄketa.</p>
<p>For one month she lived with him as a 
devoted wife; then because of her past kamma, her husband became estranged from 
her, and turned her out of the house. She was married again with the same 
result, and a third time to a friar. IsidÄsÄ«â€™s father persuaded him to give up 
the pilgrimâ€™s life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to 
stay with her any more. IsidÄsÄ« then met the therÄ«
<a href="j.htm#Jinadattaa" title="j/j.htm#Jinadattaa">JinadattÄ</a>, whom she 
entertained to a meal at her house. Under JinadattÄ, IsidÄsÄ« joined the Order 
and became an arahant.</p>
<p>The TherÄ«gÄthÄ (vv.400-47), which 
contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present 
life, but also her past lives. She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and 
had committed adultery in that life. As a result she was born in hell for a long 
time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite 
slave and a carterâ€™s daughter. In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in 
payment of her fatherâ€™s debts. When she was sixteen, the merchantâ€™s son, 
GiridÄsa, fell in love with her and married her. He had already one wife, and 
the new one caused dissension between her and her husband. Therefore it was that 
in this life she was hated by her husbands. This account of her sojourn in 
samsÄra was related by IsidÄsÄ« in response to a request by one of her 
fellow-nuns, BodhÄ« (ThigA.260ff).</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks (Sisters, Introd. 
pp.xxii f) that IsidÄsÄ«â€™s verses in the TherÄ«gÄthÄ suggest late literary craft 
and bear the impress of late literary creation. The scene is PÄtaliputta, and 
not any of the usual towns mentioned in the Canon, and the name of IsidÄsÄ«â€™s 
sponsor – JindattÄ â€” is, she says, significant. Perhaps there are traces here of 
Jainistic influence.</p>
<p>In the DÄ«pavamsa (xviii.9) IsidÄsÄ« (IsidÄsikÄ) 
is mentioned in a list of eminent therÄ«s who were leaders of the Order of 
bhikkhunis.</p>
