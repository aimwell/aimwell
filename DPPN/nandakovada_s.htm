  <h2>Nandakovāda Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Preached at the Rājakārāma, at the Buddha’s special 
request, by Nandaka (q.v.), to five hundred nuns led by Pajāpatī. The first part 
of the sermon is a catechism, the second is more explanatory, and contains 
various similes illustrating the impermanence of the senses and of sense 
objects. The sermon ends with the seven bojjhangas. After the sermon the nuns 
visit the Buddha who, seeing that their minds are not quite ripe, asks Nandaka 
to repeat the sermon to them the next day. Nandaka does so, and their 
enlightenment is assured. M.iii.270ff.; cf. J.ii.392, where it says the nuns 
became arahants at the conclusion of the sermon.</p>
