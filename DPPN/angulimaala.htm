  <h2>Angulimāla (Angulimālaka)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A robber who was converted by the Buddha 
in the twentieth year of his ministry, and who, later, became an arahant. His 
story appears both in the Majjhima Cy., 743ff., and in the Thag. Cy., ii.57ff. 
The two accounts differ in certain details; I have summarised the two versions.
</p>
<p>He was the son of the brahmin
<a href="bhaggava.htm" title="b/bhaggava.htm">Bhaggava</a>, 
chaplain to the king of <a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>, his mother being
<a href="mantaanii.htm" title="ma/mantaanii.htm">Mantānī</a>. He was born under the 
thieves' constellation, and on the night of his birth all the armour in the town 
shone, including that belonging to the king. Because this omen did no harm to 
anyone the babe was named Ahimsaka. The Thag. Cy. says he was first called 
Himsaka and then Ahimsaka. See also Ps. of the Brethren, 323, n.3.</p>
<p>At <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> he became a favourite at 
the teacher’s house, but his jealous fellow-students poisoned his teacher’s 
mind, and the latter, bent on his destruction, asked as his honorarium a 
thousand human right-hand fingers. Thereupon Ahimsaka waylaid travellers in the 
<a href="jaalinii.htm" title="j/jaalinii.htm">Jālinī</a> forest in Kosala and killed them, taking a finger from each. The 
finger-bones thus obtained he made into a garland to hang round his neck, hence 
the name Angulimāla.</p>
<p>As a result of his deeds whole villages 
were deserted, and the king ordered a detachment of men to seize the bandit, 
whose name nobody knew. But Angulimāla’s mother, guessing the truth, started off 
to warn him. By now he lacked but one finger to complete his thousand, and 
seeing his mother coming he determined to kill her. But the Buddha, seeing his 
upanissaya, went himself to the wood, travelling thirty yojanas, (DA.i.240; 
J.iv.180) and intercepted Angulimāla on his way to slay his mother. Angulimāla 
was converted by the Buddha’s power and received the “ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā” 
(Thag.868-70) while the populace were yelling at the king’s palace for the 
robber’s life. Later, the Buddha presented him before King 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> when the 
latter came to <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>, and Pasenadi, filled with wonder, offered to provide 
the monk with all requisites. Angulimāla, however, had taken on the dhutangas 
and refused the king’s offer.</p>
<p>When he entered <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> for alms, he 
was attacked by the mob, but on the admonition of the Buddha, endured their 
wrath as penance for his former misdeeds.</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapadatthakatha 
(iii.169) he appears to have died soon after he joined the Order.</p>
<p>There is a story of how be eased a 
woman’s labour pains by an act of truth. The words he used in this saccakiriyā (yato 
aham sabbaññutabuddhassa ariyassa ariyāya jātiyā jāto) have come to be regarded 
as a paritta to ward off all dangers and constitute the Angulimāla Paritta. The 
water that washed the stone on which he sat in the woman’s house came to be 
regarded as a panacea (M.ii.103-4; MA.747f).</p>
<p>In the Angulimāla Sutta he is addressed 
by Pasenādi as Gagga Mantānīputta, his father being a Gagga. The story is 
evidently a popular one and occurs also in the Avadāna Sataka (No.27).</p>
<p>At the Kosala king’s <a href="asadisadaana.htm" title="ay/asadisadaana.htm">Asadisadāna</a>, an 
untamed elephant, none other being available, was used to bear the parasol over 
Angulimāla. The elephant remained perfectly still — such was Angulimāla’s power 
(DhA.iii.185; also DA.ii.654).</p>
<p>The conversion of Angulimāla is often 
referred to as a most compassionate and wonderful act of the Buddha’s, e.g. in 
the Sutasoma Jātaka, (J.v.456f.; see also J.iv.180; SnA.ii.440; DhA.i.124) which 
was preached concerning him. The story of Angulimāla is quoted as that of a man 
in whose case a beneficent kamma arose and destroyed former evil kamma 
(AA.i.369).</p>
<p>It was on his account that the rule not 
to ordain a captured robber was enacted (Vin.i.74).</p>
<p>For his identification with Kalmāsapāda 
see J.P.T.S., 1909, pp. 240ff.</p>
