  <h2>Dasaratha Jātaka (No.461)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Dasaratha, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, had three 
children, Rāmapandita, Lakkhana and Sītā. On the death of his queen he took 
another queen and had by her a son, Bharata. When Bharata was seven years old 
his mother claimed the kingdom for him in accordance with a boon granted her by 
the king. The king was horrified and fearing that she would harm his elder 
children, sent them into the forest for twelve years, asking them to return 
after his death. In the forest Rāma lived the ascetic life while Lakkhana and 
Sītā provided him with food. Dasaratha died after nine years, and when the 
ministers refused to recognise Bharata as king, he went into the forest in 
search of Rāma. Rāma, however, refused to return until three more years had 
elapsed, and on Bharata refusing to occupy the throne, Rāma gave him his straw 
slippers to be placed on the throne in his absence. When cases were heard, if 
the decision given was wrong, the slippers would beat upon each other, but, if 
right, they would lie quiet. After three years Rāma returned and reigned from 
his palace of Sucandaka for sixteen thousand years, with Sītā as queen consort.

<p>Dasaratha was Suddhodana, Bharata 
Ānanda, Lakkhana Sāriputta, Sītā Rāhulamātā and Rāma the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was related to a man of 
Sāvatthi who greatly grieved at his father’s death and neglected all his duties. 
J.iv.123-30.</p>
