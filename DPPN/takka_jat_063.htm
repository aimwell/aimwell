  <h2>Takka Jātaka (No.63)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic on 
the banks of the Ganges, from which he rescued Dutthakumārī, daughter of the 
setthi of Benares, who had been thrown into the flood during a storm by her 
long-suffering servants. The ascetic succumbed to the wiles of Dutthakumārī and 
took up his abode with her in a village, where they earned their living by 
selling takka (curds or dates). He therefore came to be called Takkapandita. One 
day the village was looted by robbers, and they carried the woman away together 
with their booty. Living happily with the robber chief, she feared that her 
former husband might come to claim her; she therefore sent for him with sweet 
words, planning to have him killed.</p>
<p>While being beaten by the robber-chief, 
Takkapandita kept repeating, “Ungrateful wretches,” and, on being asked the 
reason, related the story. The robber thereupon killed the woman.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with the 
robber-chief.</p>
<p>The story was related to a 
passion-tossed monk (J.i.295-99). </p>
<p>The Jātaka is sometimes referred to as 
the Takkāriya Jātaka, E.g., J.v.446 (16).</p>
