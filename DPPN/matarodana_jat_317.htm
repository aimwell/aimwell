<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in a family worth eighty 
crores. When his parents died, his brother managed the estate. Some time later 
the brother also died, but the Bodhisatta shed no tear. His relations and 
friends called him heartless, but he convinced them that he did not weep because 
he knew that all things are transient.</p>
<p>The story was related to a landowner of S훮vatthi who gave 
himself up to despair on the death of his brother. The Buddha visited him and 
preached to him, and the man became a sot훮panna. J.iii.56 8.</p>
