<p>A courtesan of Hatthinipura in the Kuru kingdom. Once a 
large number of monks assembled there, and when she was asked to help in 
entertaining them, she abused the monks, calling them “shavelings.” Later she 
was born as a peta in a village far away. She revealed her identity to an 
upāsaka, who had come from Hatthinipura on business. He reported the matter to 
her mother, who gave alms in her name, and after that the peta was happy.
