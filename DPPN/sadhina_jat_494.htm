  <h2>Sādhīna Jātaka (No. 494)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Sādhīna, king of Mithilā. 
He built six alms halls and spent daily six hundred thousand pieces on alms. He 
lived a good life, and his subjects followed his example. In the assembly of the 
Devas his praises were spoken, and various Devas wished to see him. So Sakka 
sent Mātalī, with his chariot, to fetch Sādhīna to Tāvatimsa. When he arrived, 
Sakka gave him half his kingdom and his luxuries. For seven hundred years, in 
human reckoning, Sādhīna ruled in heaven, and then he became dissatisfied and 
returned to his royal park on earth. The park keeper brought news of his arrival 
to Nārada, the reigning king, seventh in direct descent from Sādhīna. Nārada 
arrived, paid homage to Sādhīna, and offered him the kingdom. But Sātdhīna 
refused it, saying that all he wished was to distribute alms for seven days. 
Nārada arranged a vast largesse for distribution. For seven days Sādhīna gave 
alms, and on the seventh day he died and was born in Tāvatimsa. The story was 
related to lay disciples to show them the importance of keeping the fast day.</p>
<p>Ānanda is identified with Nārada and Anuruddha with Sakka 
(J.iv.355 60).</p>
<p>Sādhīna was one of the four human beings who went to 
Tāvatimsa while in their human body. Mil.115, 271; MA.ii.738.</p>
