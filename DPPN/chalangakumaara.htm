<p>A general sent by the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> to 
instruct Elakamāra in the art of war; afterwards he became Elakamāra’s 
commander-in-chief. Elakamāra’s wife misconducted herself with Chalangakumāra 
and also with his attendant Dhanantevāsī. Kunāla said it was he who was 
Chalangakumāra and that, therefore, he was an incarnation of the Buddha. 
J.v.425, 430.</p>
