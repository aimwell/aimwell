<p>A nunnery built by <a href="devaanampiyatissa.htm" title="d/devaanampiyatissa.htm">Devānampiyatissa</a> for the use of 
<a href="sanghamitta_theri.htm" title="sa/sanghamitta_theri.htm">Sanghamittā</a>. It was called Hatthālhaka because it was built near the spot where 
the king’s state elephant was fettered. Sanghamittā’s following came to be 
called Hatthalhakā from living in the vihāra.</p>
<p>Later, they occupied also all the twelve buildings 
attached to the Upāsikā-vihāra, even when other sects arose (Mhv.xix.71, 83; 
xx.21f, 49). The vihāra was originally within the city wall of Anurādhapura; but 
later, when Kutikanna-Tissa and Vasabha raised the boundary wall, part of the 
vihāra grounds lay outside. The original boundary included the Kadambanadī. MT. 
611.</p>
