<p>The capital of <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> and situated near the modern Patna. 
The Buddha visited it shortly before his death. It was then a mere village and 
was known as Pātaligāma. At that time <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu’s</a> ministers, 
<a href="sunidha.htm" title="s/sunidha.htm">Sunīdha</a> and 
<a href="vassakaara.htm" title="va/vassakaara.htm">Vassakāra</a>, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajjīs</a>. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also 
mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The 
gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at 
which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).</p>
<p>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is 
uncertain. <a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a> seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it 
was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. 
The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu (Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 
1). The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara 
Nikāya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, 
however, in the time of <a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a> that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the 
ninth year of his reign Asoka’s income from the four gates of the city is said 
to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred 
thousand for his sabhā or Council (Sp.i.52).</p>
<p>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, 
and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it 
(Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of 
the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta 
was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ānanda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when 
they came to Pātaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; 
S.v.15f., 171f). At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built 
an assembly ball for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).</p>
<p>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its 
foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of 
Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to 
Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A 
large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into 
various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when 
necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the 
building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might 
be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his 
monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).</p>
<p>Pātaliputta was also called Pupphapura (Mhv.iv.31, etc.; 
Dpv.xi.28) and Kusamapura (Mbv.p.153). The journey from Jambukola, in Ceylon, to 
Pātaliputta took fourteen days, seven of which were 
spent on the sea voyage to Tāmalitti (E.g., Mhv.xi.24). The Asokārāma built by 
Asoka was near Pātaliputta (Mhv.xxix.36). The Buddha’s water pot and belt were 
deposited in Pātaliputta after his death (Bu.xxviii.9). The Peta Vatthu 
Commentary (p.271) mentions that trade was carried on between Pātaliputta and 
<a href="suvannabhuumi.htm" title="s/suvannabhuumi.htm">Suvannabhūmi</a>.</p>
