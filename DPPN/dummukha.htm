<p><b>1. Dummukha.</b>-A Licchavi chieftain. He 
was present at the discussion of the Nigantha <a href="saccaka.htm" title="sa/saccaka.htm">Saccaka</a> with the Buddha, and 
seeing Saccaka discomfited in the debate, Dummukha compared him to a crab pulled 
out of a pond and ill-treated by village boys (M.i.234).</p>
<p>The Commentary says (MA.i.459) that 
Dummukha just happened to be his name. He was in reality quite handsome.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Dummukha.</b>-King of Kampilla in 
<a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a>. One day, while looking from his window down on to the palace 
yard, he saw several bulls setting upon a cow in lust, and one bull, stronger 
than the rest, killed another with his horns. The king, realizing the evil 
nature of lust, entered into a trance and became a Pacceka Buddha. J.iii.379, 
381.</p>
