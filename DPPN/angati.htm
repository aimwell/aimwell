  <h2>Angati</h2>

</ul>
<p>King of Videha; he ruled at Mithilā. His 
chief queen bore him a daughter Rujā, all his other 16,000 wives being barren.</p>
<p>His ministers were Vijaya, Sunāma and 
Alāta.</p>
<p>He questions an ascetic, Guna, as to the 
various moral duties, and following his advice, devotes himself solely to 
pleasure. Ruja, however, is virtuous and tries to deliver him from his heretical 
beliefs, but it is not till the Bodhisatta — who had been born as the Mahā 
Brahma Nārada -comes down to earth in the guise of an ascetic, and frightens the 
king with descriptions of the various hells, that Angati is convinced of the 
error of his ways.</p>
<p>He was a former incarnation of Uruvela 
Kassapa. J.vi.220-55.</p>
