</ul>
<p>A monk, when pondering on dukkha, realizes that it is the 
result of birth, and he practises according to the Dhamma to bring about its 
cessation. </p>
<p>He ponders further and gets at the root cause of all 
things; he then realizes a state free from birth, decay, old age and death, and 
he becomes aware of its realization. S.ii.80ff.</p>
