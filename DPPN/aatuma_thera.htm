<p>The son of a setthi in Sāvatthi. When he 
grew up his mother proposed to find him a wife, but on account of his upanissaya, 
he left the world and was ordained. His mother tried to entice him back but he 
declared his great determination and, developing insight, became an arahant 
(Thag.v.72; ThagA.i.160).</p>
<p>In Vipassī’s time he had been a 
householder and had made offering to Vipassī of perfumed water and fragrant 
powder.</p>
<p>Thirty-one kappas ago he was a king 
named Sugandha. Ātuma is probably identical with Gandhodakiya Thera of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.157-8.</p>
