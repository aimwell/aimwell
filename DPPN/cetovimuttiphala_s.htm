<p>1. Cetovimuttiphala Sutta.-When a monk 
perceives the foulness of the body, is conscious of the cloying of food, feels 
distaste for the world, perceives impermanence in all compounded things, and has 
the thought of death inwardly established in him, there come to him 
mind-emancipation and emancipation by way of insight and he becomes completely 
free. A.iii.84.</p>
<p>2. Cetovimuttiphala Sutta.-The thought 
of impermanence, of ill in impermanence, of no-self in ill, of renunciation and 
of dispassion â€” these things, when developed, have, as their fruit, 
mind-emancipation and emancipation by way of insight. A.iii.85.</p>
