<p>A city in the <a href="anguttaraapa.htm" title="ay/anguttaraapa.htm">Anguttarāpa</a> country 
(probably its capital). The Buddha once visited the city with 1,250 monks and 
the whole company was entertained by the <a href="keniya.htm" title="ku/keniya.htm">Jatila Keniya</a> (Vin.i.245ff). From Āpana 
the Buddha went on to Kusinārā (Vin.i.247). In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.225), 
Āpana is spoken of as a township of the Angas (Angānam nigamo) and the Buddha is 
mentioned as having stayed there with Sāriputta. </p>
<p>Several suttas were preached at Āpana, 
among them </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>the <a href="potaliya.htm" title="pu/potaliya.htm">Potaliya Sutta</a> (regarding Potaliya), 
  (M.i.359ff) </li>
  <li>
  <p>the <a href="latukikopama_s.htm" title="l/latukikopama_s.htm">Latukikopama Sutta</a> (to Udāyi) 
  (M.i.447ff), </li>
  <li>
  <p>the <a href="s6_siy.htm#Sela_s" title="s/s6_siy.htm#Sela_s">Sela Sutta</a> (regarding Sela) 
  (M.ii.146ff; Sn.pp.102ff) and </li>
  <li>
  <p>the <a href="sadhaa.htm#Apana" title="sa/sadhaa.htm#Apana">Saddha or Āpana Sutta</a> (S.v.225-7).

<p>Āpana was a brahmin village and was the 
home of the Elder Sela (ThagA.ii.47). On the occasion of the Buddha’s visit to 
Āpana, during which he converted Sela and Keniya, he seems to have stayed at 
Āpana for over a week and ordained three hundred monks in the company of Sela (Sn., 
p.112).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.586), 
the village was called Āpana because it had twenty thousand bazaars (āpanā) and 
was therefore distinguished for its shops (āpanānam ussannattā). Near the 
village, on the banks of the river Mahī, was the woodland where the Buddha 
stayed during his visits.</p>
