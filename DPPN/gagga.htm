<p>1. Gagga.-A monk. He became insane, and 
in this condition did many things unworthy of a monk. When his colleagues blamed 
him, the Buddha interceded on his behalf and suggested that he be given 
absolution for his offences, in view of his insanity. The monks acted according 
to the Buddha’s advice. Vin.i.123; ii.80f.</p>
<p>2. Gagga.-A brahmin, father of 
Angulimāla (M.ii.102). Gagga, whose wife was Mantānī, was chaplain to the king 
of Kosala (MA.ii.743). Gagga may have been a gotta-name. Thus when, after his 
ordination, Angulimāla is introduced to Pasenadi, the latter addresses him as 
Gagga Mantāniputta. M.ii.102.</p>
<p>3. Gagga.-A brahmin, father of the 
Bodhisatta in the Gagga Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
