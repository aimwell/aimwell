  <h2>Lohapāsāda</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A building at Anurādhapura, forming the uposatha hall of 
the Mahāvihāra. It was originally built by Devānampiyatissa (see Mhv.xv.205), 
but it was then a small building erected only to round off the form of Mahā 
vihāra (vihāraparipunnamattasādhakam) (MT. 364). Later, Dutthagāmani pulled it 
down and erected on its site a nine storey building, one hundred cubits square 
and high, with one hundred rooms on each storey. The building was planned 
according to a sketch of the Ambalatthikapāsāda (the actual Ambalatthikā (q.v.) 
of the Lohapāsāda was to the east of the building, DA.ii.635) in Bīranī’s palace 
which eight arahants obtained from the deva world. The building was roofed with 
copper plates, hence its name. The nine storeys were occupied by monks, 
according to their various attainments, the last four storeys being reserved for 
arahants. In the centre of the hall was a seat made in the shape of Vessavana’s 
Nārīvāhana chariot (for details see Mhv.xxvii.1ff). The building was visible out 
at sea to a distance of one league (MT. 505). Once Dutthagāmani attempted to 
preach in the assembly hall of the Lohapāsāda, but he was too nervous to 
proceed. Realizing then how difficult was the task of preachers, he endowed 
largesse for them in every vihāra (Mhv.xxxii.42ff). Dutthagāmani had always a 
great fondness for the Lohapāsāda, and as he lay dying he managed to have a last 
view of it (Mhv.xxxii.9). Thirty crores were spent on its construction; in 
Saddhātissa’s day it caught fire from a lamp, and he rebuilt it in seven storeys 
at a cost of nine millions.</p>
<p>Khallātanāga built thirty two other pāsādas round the 
Lohapāsāda for its ornamentation (Mhv.xxxiii.6), while Bhātikābhaya carried out 
various repairs to the building (Mhv.xxxiv.39), and Ānanda gāmanī added an inner 
courtyard and a verandah (ājira) (Mhv.xxxv.3). Sirināga I. rebuilt it in five 
storeys (Mhv.xxxvi.25,52), Abhayanāga built a pavilion in the courtyard and 
Gothābhaya had the pillars renewed (Mhv.xxxvi.102).</p>
<p>He evidently started to rebuild the structure, because we 
are told (Mhv.xxxvi.124) that, after his death, his son Jetthatissa completecd 
up to seven storeys the Lohapāsāda which had been left unfinished (vippakata) by 
his father.</p>
<p>The building was worth one crore, and Jetthatissa offered 
to it a jewel worth sixty thousand, after which he renamed it Manipāsāda. 
Afterwards Sona, a minister of his brother, the renegade king Mahānāma, acting 
on the advice of heretical monks led by Sanghamitta, destroyed the pāsāda and 
carried away its wealth to enrich Abhayagiri vihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.10f,59).</p>
<p>Mahānāma’s son, Sirimeghavanna, had the pāsāda restored to 
its original form (Mhv.xxxvii.62), and, later, Dhātusena renovated it 
(Mhv.xxxviii.54), as did Aggabodhi I., who distributed the three garments to 
thirty six thousand monks at the festival of dedication and assigned a village 
to provide for its protection (Mhv.xlii.20). His successor, Aggabodhi II., 
deposited in the pāsāda the Buddha’s right collar bone, which relic was later 
transferred to the Thūpārāma (Mhv.xlii.53,59). In the reign of Aggabodhi IV., 
the ruler of Malaya repaired the central pinnacle (Mhv.xlvi.30), while Mānavamma 
provided a new roof (Mhv.xlvii.65). Sena II. completely restored the pāsāda and 
placed in it an image of the Buddha in gold mosaic. The building was evidently 
not in use at the time, but he provided for its upkeep and assigned villages for 
its protection, and decreed that thirty two monks should be in constant 
residence (Mhv.li.69f). Sena IV. was in the habit of preaching in the Lohapāsāda 
periodical sermons to the monks (Mhv.liv.4) which were based on the suttas, but, 
after his death, the place again fell into disrepair and was destroyed by the 
Colas. Parakkamabāhu I. restored it once again (Mhv.lxxviii.102), but it was 
soon after pillaged again and fell into ruin, in which state it remains to this 
day. There are now sixteen hundred monolithic stone columns (the same number as 
in the time of Parakkamabāhu I.), which evidently formed the framework of the 
lowest storey.</p>
<p>Frequent mention is made in the books of sermons preached 
in the lowest storey of the Lohapāsāda, at which very large numbers were 
present. Once, when Ambapāsānavāsī Cittagutta preached the Rathavinīta Sutta, 
there were twelve thousand monks and one thousand nuns (MT.552f). On another 
occasion, Bhātikābhaya described the contents of the Relic chamber of the Mahā 
Thūpa to all the monks of the Mahāvihāra assembled in the Lohapāsāda (MT.555).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.581) that, up to his day, it was 
customary for all the monks of Ceylon, who lived to the north of the 
Mahāvālukanadī, to assemble in the Lohapāsāda twice a year, on the first and 
last days of the vassa, while those to the south of the river assembled at the 
Tissamahāvihāra. When disputes arose as to the interpretation of various rules 
or teachings, the decision was often announced by a teacher of repute from the 
lowest storey of the Lohapāsāda (DA.ii.442, 514).</p>
<p>The hood of the Nāga king Mucalinda was of the same size 
as the storehouse (bhandāgāragabbha) of the Lohapāsāda (UdA.101). A mass of 
rock, as big as the seventh storey of the Lohapāsāda, if dropped from the 
Brahmaworld, would take four months to reach the earth. DA.ii.678.</p>
