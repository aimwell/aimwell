<p>1. Atthaka.-A celebrated sage, composer 
and reciter of sacred runes, mentioned together with nine others (Vāmaka, 
Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsettha and Bhagu. 
Vin.i.245; D.i.104; DA.i.273), as the ancient rsis of the brahmins. They 
abstained from food at unseasonable times. They were the first teachers of the 
Tevijja Brahmins (D.i.238) and great sacrifices were conducted by them 
(A.iv.61).</p>
<p>Various teachings are attributed to 
them, e.g. that they recognised five kinds of Brahmins — brahmasama, devasama, 
mariyāda, sambhinnamariyāda, and brāhmanacandāla (A.iii.224ff). These sages did 
not claim to have discerned and realised the five qualities-truth, austerities, 
chastity, study and munificence — specified by the brahmins for the attainment 
of merit and the achievement of what is right (M.ii.199-200), though their 
followers behaved as if they did. Nor did they claim that they personally saw 
and knew that “here alone resides the truth and everything else is vain.” 
(M.ii.169) In the Vimānavatthu Commentary it is said that the Buddha had 
realised those things of which these sages thought and for which they wished 
(p.265). (Brahmacintitan ti brahmehi Atthakādīhi cintitam, pañcacakkhunā dittham).</p>
<p>It is said that Atthaka and the other 
seers had the divine eye and had incorporated the teachings of Kassapa Buddha 
into their own scriptures. Thus (at that time) the three Vedas were in 
conformity with the Dhamma. But later the brahmins went back on these teachings 
(DA.i.273).</p>
<p>Atthaka is generally identified with 
Astaka mentioned as the author of Rg-veda x.104, unless the name be taken as a 
corrupt reading under which some representation of Atri may lurk. VT.ii.130, 
n.2.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Atthaka.-King. Mentioned in a list of 
kings who in times past had been unable to get beyond the domain of sense in 
spite of making great gifts and holding great sacrifices. J.vi.99.</p>
<hr>
<p>3. Atthaka.-King. Mentioned in a list of 
former kings who had followed righteousness and who, by waiting diligently on 
ascetics and recluses, had gone to Sakka’s heaven. J.vi.251.</p>
<hr>
<p>4. Atthaka.-King. When Dandaka, having 
sinned against Kisavaccha, was destroyed with his realm, three of the 
subordinate lords within his kingdom — Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhīmaratha — went to 
consult the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga on the fate of Dandaka and his fellow-sinners. 
Their doubts were set at rest, and at the end of Sarabhanga’s discourse they 
became free of their sensuality (kāmarāga) (J.v.135-49). Sakka himself was 
present at the interview and asked questions of Sarabhanga.</p>
<hr>
<p>5. Atthaka.-Pacceka Buddha. Mentioned in 
a nominal list. M.iii.70; Ap.i.107.</p>
