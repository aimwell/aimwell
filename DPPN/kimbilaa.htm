<p>A town on the banks of the Ganges. It 
was in a veluvana (more probably a niceluvana; the Anguttara Commentary ii.642 
explains it as a Mucalindavana) there the Buddha stayed and where the Kimbila 
and Kimbilā Suttas were preached (A.iii.247, etc.; S.iv.181f; v.322).  </p>
<p>According 
to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), it was the birthplace of the setthiputta Kimbila (Kimbila 2). The city existed in the time of Kassapa Buddha 
and was the residence of the woman who later became Kannamundapetī (Pv.12; 
PvA.151). Among the palaces seen by Nimi when he visited heaven was that of a 
deva who had been a very pious man of Kimbilā (J.vi.121). Another such pious 
person of the same city was Rohaka with his wife Bhadditthikā. Vv.xxii.4; 
VvA.109.</p>
