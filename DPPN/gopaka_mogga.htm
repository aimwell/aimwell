<p><b>Gopaka Moggallāna.</b>-A brahmin minister of 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, in charge of some defence works in Rājagaha (M.iii.7). See Gopaka 
Moggallāna Sutta. The Theragāthā (vs.1024) contains a stanza spoken by 
Moggallāna Thera in answer to a question by Gopaka Moggallāna. Gopaka asks 
Moggallāna how many of the Buddha’s teachings he remembers. Eighty-four 
thousand, answers the latter and proceeds to explain. ThagA.ii.130.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta.</b>-Soon after the 
Buddha’s death, <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>, on his way to 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> for alms, visits the place where Gopaka Moggallāna was strengthening the city’s defences. Moggallāna asks him if 
there were any monk in every way like the Buddha, and receives a negative 
answer. <a href="vassakaara.htm" title="va/vassakaara.htm">Vassakāra</a> arrives and, on being told the topic of conversation, asks the 
same question and is told by Ānanda that the monks regard the Dhamma as their 
protector. It is true, however, that there are monks whom they hold in great 
esteem and reverence, and Ānanda enumerates the qualities which win for them 
such homage. M.iii.7ff</p>
