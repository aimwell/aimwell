  <h2>Mahā Kappina Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, 
considered foremost among those who taught the monks (bhikkuovādakānam) 
(A.i.25). He was older than the Buddha, and was born in a frontier kingdom three 
hundred yojanas in extent, in the city of Kukkutavatī. On the death of his 
father he became rājā under the name of Mahā Kappina. His chief wife was 
<a href="anojaa.htm" title="ay/anojaa.htm">Anojā</a>, from <a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sāgala</a> in the Madda kingdom. She had been his companion in good 
works in past births. Every morning Mahā Kappina would send men out of the four 
gates of the city to stop any scholarly or learned men who might happen to pass 
along the road, and then to return and tell him of them. He owned five horses: 
Vāla, Puppha, Vālavāhana, Pupphavāhana and Supatta. Supatta he alone rode, the 
others were used by his messengers. One day, after the Buddha’s appearance in 
the world, traders came from Sāvatthi to Kukkutavatī and, after disposing of 
their goods, went to see Mahā Kappina. He received them and asked them about 
their country and the teaching (sāsana) which they followed. “Sire,” they 
replied, “we cannot tell you with unwashed mouths.” A golden jug of water was 
brought, and with cleansed mouths and clasped hands they told the king of the 
appearance of the Buddha. At the word “Buddha” Kappina’s body was suffused with 
rapture. He made them utter the word three times, giving them one hundred 
thousand pieces. The men told him also of the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he 
trebled his gifts and forthwith renounced the world, followed by his ministers. 
They set forth to find the Buddha, and reached the bank of a river which they 
crossed by an “Act of Truth,” saying, “If this teacher be a Sammāsambuddha, let 
not even a hoof of these horses be wetted.” In this manner they crossed three 
rivers: the Aravacchā, the Nīlavāhana (q.v.), and the Candabhāgā. The Buddha 
perceived them with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Sāvatthi, went 
through the air to the banks of the Candabhāgā (one hundred and twenty yojanas, 
says J.iv.180; see also SNA.ii.440)&nbsp; and sat down under the great banyan 
tree facing the landing stage of the river, sending forth Buddha rays. Kappina 
and his men saw him and prostrated themselves. The Buddha taught them the 
Doctrine, and they became arahants and joined the Order, the formula “Ehi 
bhikkhu” being their sanction and their ordination. But see Vsm.393, where it 
says that at the end of the sermon Kappina became only an anāgāmin and his 
followers sotāpannas.</p>
<p>Anojā and the wives of Kappina’s ministers hearing that 
their husbands had renounced the world and gone to see the Buddha, determined to 
do likewise. They crossed the river in the same way as Kappina and his retinue, 
and approached the Buddha as he sat under the banyan tree on the banks of the 
Candabhāgā. The Buddha made the husbands and wives invisible to each other and 
preached to the latter. They became sotāpannas and were ordained by Uppalavannā, 
the Buddha taking the monks to Jetavana. Mahā Kappina spent his days in the 
ecstasy of jhāna, and so full of happiness was he that he constantly repeated “aho 
sukham, aho sukham,” which made the monks suspect that he was longing for the 
pleasures of kingship which he had left behind, until the Buddha dispelled their 
doubts.</p>
<p>One day the Buddha discovered that Kappina lived 
inactively, enjoying his happiness, and that he never taught anybody. (Vin.i.105 
records that when Kappina was in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi he wondered 
whether he need attend the uposatha ceremonies, since he himself was pure). The 
Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go. He sent for him and asked him to 
teach the Doctrine to his associates. This Kappina did, and at the end of a 
single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title 
conferred on him. </p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Kappina had registered 
a vow to become chief among admonishers of monks, having seen a similar honour 
conferred on a disciple of the Buddha. He was at that time an assessor (akkhadassa) 
of Hamsavatī, and having invited the Buddha and his monks entertained them with 
great honour. In another birth he was a Koliyan, and waited upon five hundred 
Pacceka Buddhas and gave them robes. The story of the entertainment of the 
Pacceka Buddhas is given at length in DhA.ii.112ff., and the number given there 
is one thousand. They came to Benares, but the king, occupied with the ploughing 
festival, asked them to return on the third day. The wife of the senior weaver 
of a village near by heard this and invited the Pacceka Buddhas to her village, 
where there were one thousand artisans. On the invitation being accepted, she 
returned quickly to the village, told the people of what she had done, and they 
all made the necessary preparations, each family looking after one Pacceka 
Buddha. The Pacceka Buddhas, by their own wish, stayed on for three months, the 
same woman seeing to all their comforts. At the end of their visit, she 
persuaded each family to give a set of robes to its own Pacceka Buddha. The 
senior weaver was Kappina and his wife Anojā. </p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was the leader of a 
guild of one thousand men and built a great parivena containing one thousand 
rooms. AA.i.175ff.; ThagA.i.507ff.; SA.ii.172ff.; DhA.ii.117ff. gives a more 
detailed and slightly different version; ep. Avadānas.ii.102f.</p>
<p>It is said (DhA.ii.115f) that once Kassapa Buddha was 
preaching and that all the householders of Benares, with their families, went to 
hear him. Scarcely had they entered the monastery when there was a heavy 
downpour of rain. Those who had friends among the novices and monks found 
shelter in their cells, the others were unprotected. The senior householder then 
suggested that they should build a great monastery so that all might be 
sheltered in future; the others agreeing, he himself gave one thousand, each of 
the other men five hundred, and each woman two hundred and fifty. The monastery 
had one thousand pinnacles, and when money ran short, each gave half as much 
again. At the dedication ceremony the festival lasted for seven days. The senior 
householder’s wife, Anojā, offered the Buddha a casket of anoja flowers and 
placed at his feet a garment of the colour of the flowers worth one thousand, 
and made a wish that in future births her body should be of the colour of the 
anoja flower.</p>
<p>Although Kappina was famed as a teacher of monks, the 
Theragāthā, curiously enough, contains verses in which he admonishes the nuns (bhikkhuniyo) 
(Thag.vss. 547 556; ThagA.i.511).</p>
<p>Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale (? odāta), 
thin, and having a prominent nose (tanukam tunganāsikam). He possessed great 
iddhi-powers and had attained every samāpatti, which could be attained 
(J.ii.284). (It was owing to his iddhi powers that he was able to follow the 
Buddha to the Brahma world, S.i.145; see also S.v.315, where he is described as 
samādhibhāvanīya). It has been remarked (Brethren, p.257 n.2) that the verses 
attributed to him are, for the most part, more gnomic sayings of popular 
philosophy than genuine Dhamma, and that they would have befitted an early Greek 
Pagan. Mrs. Rhys Davids (J.R.A.S. 1927, ii.p.206f; also Sākya, p.140) has an 
interesting theory that Kappina was Assaji’s teacher.</p>
<p>Mahā Kappina was quite often in the company of Sāriputta, 
and it is said (Thag.vs.1086) that once, seeing the profound homage the gods 
payed to his colleague, he smiled by way of congratulation.</p>
