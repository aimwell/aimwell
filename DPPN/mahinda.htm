<hr>
<p><b>1. Mahinda Thera. </b>Son of Asoka and brother of 
Sanghamittā. He was fourteen at the time of the coronation of his father and was 
ordained at the age of twenty, his preceptor being Moggaliputtatissa. The 
ordination was performed by Mahādeva, while Majjhantika recited the kammavācā. 
Mahinda became an arahant on the day of his ordination (Mhv.v.204ff.; Dpv.v.24 f 
; Sp.i.51). He spent three years in study of the Doctrine under his preceptor, 
and, later, when the latter retired to Ahogangā, he left his one thousand 
disciples for seven years under the care of Mahinda (Mhv.v.233; Sp.i.52). When 
the Third Council was held, Mahinda had been for twelve years a monk and was 
charged with the mission of converting Ceylon. But he delayed for six months, 
until Devānampiyatissa became king. He then went to Dakkhināgiri and from there 
to his birthplace, Vedisagiri, staying in Vedisagiri vihāra and visiting his 
mother, the queen Devī. Still one more month he tarried, teaching the Doctrine 
to Bhanduka, and then, on the full moon day of Jettha, at the request of Sakka, 
he went, in company with </p>
<ul>
  <li>Itthiya, </li>
  <li>Uttiya, </li>
  <li>Sambala, </li>
  <li>Bhaddasāla, </li>
  <li>Sumanasāmanera and </li>
  <li>Bhanduka, </li>
</ul>
<p>to Ceylon, where he converted Devānampiyatissa by 
preaching to him the Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta. Later, on the same day, he 
preached the Samacitta Sutta. The next day, at the request of the king, he 
visited Anurādhapura, travelling through the air and alighting on the site of 
the (later) Pathamacetiya. After a meal at the palace he preached the Petavatthu, 
the Vimānavatthu and the Sacca Samyutta, and Anulā and her five hundred 
companions became sotāpannas. Later, in the elephant stables, he preached the 
Devadūta Sutta to the assembled people, and, in the evening, the Bālapandita 
Sutta, in Nandanavana. The night he spent in Mahāmeghavana, and on the next day 
the king gave the park to Mahinda, on behalf of the Order.</p>
<p>Mahinda pointed out to the king various spots destined to 
be connected with the growth of the sāsana in Ceylon, offering flowers at the 
same, and at the site of the (later) Mahā Thūpa, he described the visits of the 
Four Buddhas of this kappa to Ceylon. On the fourth day he preached the 
Anamatagga Sutta in Nandanavana and helped the king in defining the boundaries 
of what later became the Mahāvihāra. On the fifth day he preached the Khajjanīya 
Sutta, on the sixth the Gomayapindī sutta, and on the seventh the 
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.</p>
<p>The pāsāda first built for the residence of Mahinda was 
called Kālapāsāda parivena. Other buildings associated with him were the 
Sunhātaparivena, the Dīghacanka parivena, the Phalagga parivena, the 
Therāpassaya parivena, the Marugana-parivena, and the 
Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena. </p>
<p>Twenty six days Mahinda stayed in Mahāmeghavana, and on 
the thirteenth day of the bright half of Āsālha, after having preached the 
Mahāppamāda Sutta, he went to Missakapabbata, to spend the vassa. The king had 
sixty eight rock cells built in the mountain and gave them to the theras on the 
full moon day. On the same day Mahinda ordained sixty two monks, who attained 
arahantship, at Tumbarumālaka. After the full moon day of Kattika, at the 
conclusion of the pavārana ceremony, Mahinda held a consultation with 
Devānampiyatissa and sent Sumanasāmanera to Pātaliputta to bring the relics of 
the Buddha from Dhammāsoka and other relics from Sakka. These relics were 
brought and placed on the Missakapabbata, which from then onwards was called 
Cetiyegiri. The collar bone from among the relics was deposited in the Thūpārāma 
(q.v.), which was built for the purpose. It was at Mahinda’s suggestion that 
Devānampiyatissa sent an embassy headed by Mahāarittha to Asoka, with a request 
that Sanghamittā should come to Ceylon with a branch of the Bodhi tree. The 
request was granted, and Sanghamittā arrived in Ceylon with the branch. 
Devānampiyatissa, during the later part of his reign, acting on the advice of 
Mahinda, built numerous vihāras, each one yojana from the other; among them were 
Issarasamanaka and Vessagiri.</p>
<p>Mahinda is said to have taught the Commentaries to the 
Tipitaka in, the Singhalese language, after translating them from the Pāli 
(Cv.xxxvii.228ff).</p>
<p>The Samantapāsādikā (pp. 102ff ) mentions a recital held 
by Mahinda under the presidency of Mahāarittha.</p>
<p>Mahinda continued to live for the first eight years of the 
reign of Uttiya, who succeeded Devānampiyatissa. Then, at the age of sixty, he 
died on the eighth day of the bright half of Assayuja, in Cetiyagiri, where he 
was spending the rainy season. His body was brought in procession, with every 
splendor and honour, to the Mahāvihāra and placed in the Pañhambamālaka, where 
homage was paid to it for a whole week. It was then burnt on a pyre of fragrant 
wood on the east of the Therānambandhamālaka, to the left of the site of the 
Mahā Thūpa. A cetiya was erected on that spot over half the remains, the other 
half being distributed in thūpas built on Cetiyagiri and elsewhere. The place of 
cremation was called Isibhūmangana, and there for many centuries were cremated 
the remains of holy men who lived within a distance of three yojanas.( For 
details of Mahinda see Mhv.xiii. xx; Dpv.vii.57f., xii., xiii., iv.: xv.; 
Sp.i.61, 69ff., 79ff., 83ff., 90ff., 103, etc.)</p>
<p>Later, King Sirimeghavanip had a life size image of 
Mahinda made of gold; this he took to the Ambatthalacetiya. For eight days a 
festival was held in its honour; on the ninth day the image was taken from 
Ambatthala, carried by the king himself at the head of a large and splendid 
procession, and placed for three days in Sotthiyākara vihāra. On the twelfth day 
it was taken with all splendours to Anurādhapura, to the Mahāvihāra, where it 
was left for three months in the courtyard of the Bodhi tree. From there it was 
removed to the inner city and deposited in a magnificent image house to the 
south east of the palace. An endowment was set up for the annual performance of 
ceremonies in honour of the image, and this custom was continued for many 
centuries. The image was brought from the inner town to the (Mahā)vihāra on the 
pavārana day, and every year an offering was made on the thirteenth day 
(Cv.xxxvii.66ff).</p>
<p>Dhātusena had the image brought to the place where 
Mahinda’s body was cremated and there held a great festival (Cv.xxxviii.58), 
while Aggabodhi I. set up the image on the banks of the tank called Mahindatata, 
and ensured that the special task of carrying the image to the dyke of the tank 
was the task of the Taracchas. Cv.xlii.30.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahinda.</b> See Indra (=Sakka).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahinda.</b> King, father of Phussa Buddha 
(AA.i.165; SA.iii.4; DhA.i.84). Elsewhere he is called Jayasena. See Phussa.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mahinda. </b>A king of old, descendant of 
Mahāsammata, and last of a dynasty which ruled at Rojanagara. Twelve of his sons 
and grandsons ruled in Campā. Dpv.iii.28.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Mahinda I. </b>Brother of Kassapa III. and king of 
Ceylon (724 27 A.C.). He refused to be crowned, out of sorrow for the death of 
his friend Nīla, and administered the government as ādipāda. He thus came to be 
known as Adipāda Mahinda. His brother’s son, Aggabodhi, was his viceroy, while 
his own son was made ruler of Dakkhinadesa.</p>
<p>He gave ten cartloads of food to the Mahāpāli and would 
eat nothing without first giving of it to beggars. He built a nunnery for the 
bhikkhunīs (called Mahindaupassaya) and gave to it the village of Nagaragalla. 
He also built the Mahindatata vihāra. Cv.xiviii.26ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Mahinda.</b> Son of Aggabodhi VII. He was made 
viceroy, but died young. Cv.xlviii.69, 75.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Mahinda.</b> Son of Silāmegha (Aggabodhi VI.) 
(Cv.xlviii.42, 76). Aggabodhi made him senāpati and gave over the government to 
him. But when Aggabodhi VI. died and Aggabodhi VII. came to the throne, Mahinda 
went to Mahātittha. Later, on the death of Aggabodhi VII., Mahinda quelled all 
disturbances and put the queen in chains because she conspired to kill him. His 
cousin Dappula rose against him, but was defeated after much fighting. Mahinda 
then married the queen of Aggabodhi VI. and became king as Mahinda II., when a 
son was born to him. Dappula again rose in revolt, but Mahinda made a treaty 
with him and gave him part of Rohana with the Gālhagangā as boundary.</p>
<p>Among Mahinda’s benefactions was the erection of the 
Dāmavihāra-parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra in Pulatthipura, also the 
costly Ratanapāsāda, containing a golden image of the Buddha. To the Silāmegha 
nunnery Mahinda gave a silver Bodhisatta statue. He had the Abhidhamma recited 
by the monks of Hemasāli Vihāra, and built many shrines and helped those who 
were poor or in trouble. To the lame he gave bulls and to the Damilas horses. He 
strengthened the weir of the Kālavāpi. He reigned for twenty years (772 92 A.C.) 
and was succeeded by his son Udaya I. (Cv.xlviii.83ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Mahinda.</b> Son of the Adipāda Dāthāsīva of Rohana. 
He quarreled with his father, took service under Udaya I. and married his 
daughter Devā. He was later sent to Rohana, where he drove out his father. His 
two sons revolted against him, and, with Udaya’s help, led an army against him. 
Mahinda defeated them, but was killed in a fight with another kinsman. 
Cv.xlix.10ff.; 66ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Mahinda.</b> Son of Udaya I.; he was, however, known 
by the name of Dhammikasilāmegha and was a very pious man. He gave the income 
from the Getthumba Canal to be used in repairs of the Ratanapāsāda. He became 
king as Mahinda III. and reigned for four years (797 801 A.C.). Cv.xlix.38ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Mahinda. </b>Son of Mahinda III. When Aggabodhi IX. 
came to the throne, contrary to the laws of succession, Mahinda fled to India 
(Cv.xlix.84f). He was afterwards slain by Sena I. (Cv.l.4).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Mahinda.</b> Younger brother of Sena I. and his 
viceroy. He quelled the rising of Udaya against the king, his brother. When the 
Pandu king invaded Ceylon, Mahinda led an army against him, and, on the defeat 
of his forces, he cut his own throat. Cv.l. 6, 10, 21ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Mahinda.</b> Eldest son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of 
Rohana. He was killed by Kittaggabodhi’s sister. Cv.l.51.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>13. Mahinda.</b> Son of the Adipāda Kassapa and brother 
of Sena II. He married Tissā and Kitti. He became viceroy under Sena II. and 
ruled in Dakkhinadesa. Later he was discovered guilty of an intrigue in the 
king’s harem, and fled, unrecognized, with his family, to Malaya. Afterwards, 
however, he regained his honors and continued as viceroy, his daughter Sanghā 
being married to Kassapa, son of Sena II. Mahinda built a temple under the Bodhi 
tree, and, in the course of its construction, a workman discovered that one of 
the beams would harm a branch of the tree. Mahinda, on being informed of this, 
came and made a saccakiriyā, as a result of which the branch of the tree 
straightened itself during the night, leaving the building free. Mahinda also 
built the Mahindasena parivena, and died in the twenty third year of Sena’s 
reign (Cv.l.59; li.7, 13, 15ff., 53ff). Adipāda Kittaggabodhi was his Son. 
Ibid., 94.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>14. Mahinda.</b> Son of Kassapa V., and brother of Sena 
II. and Sanghā. When the Adipāda Kittaggabodhi raised a rebellion in Rohana 
against Udaya II., the latter sent Mahinda to quell it with the help of the 
general Vajiragga. The expedition was completely successful and Kittaggabodhi 
taken prisoner. Mahinda stayed in Mahāgāma and ruled over Rohana justly and 
well. Among his works was the construction of a dam across the Mahānadī 
(Cv.li.99ff). When Kassapa IV. became king, Mahinda revolted against him, but 
the king, through the influence of Mahinda’s father, persuaded him to desist. 
Later, Mahinda returned to Anurādhapura at the request of the monks, and, after 
having married the king’s daughter, went back to Rohana, where, evidently, he 
died. Cv.lii.4ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>15. Mahinda.</b> Viceroy of Sena IV. and probably his 
brother. He afterwards became king as Mahinda IV. (956 72 A.C.). He married a 
Kālinga princess. During his reign, the Vallabha king invaded Ceylon, but was 
defeated by the general Sena and entered into a treaty with Mahinda. Mahinda 
showed great favour to the Pamsukulikas and the Lābhavāsins and decreed that the 
incomes derived from vihāras should not be taxed. His good acts were many. He 
had a Commentary to the Abhidhamma written by the Thera Dhammamitta in the 
Sitthagāma-parivena and the Abhidhamma recited by the Thera Dāthānāga.</p>
<p>He made great offerings at the Mahā Thūpa and started to 
build the Candanapāsāda, where he had preserved the Hair Relic of the Buddha. He 
restored the temple of the four cetiyas in Padalañchana as well as the Temple of 
the Tooth, the Dhammasanganigeha and the Mahāpāli. He built the Mahāmallaka for 
the Theravāda nuns and completed the Manipāsāda. Mahinda’s wife was Kittī (q.n), 
who, herself, engaged in various works. Their son was Sena (Sena V.). 
Cv.liv.1ff.; Cv. Trs.i.178, n. 2; 179, n. 2; 183, n. 2.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>16. Mahinda.</b> Younger brother of Sena V. He 
succeeded Sena as Mahinda V. and ruled for ten years at Anurādhapura under great 
difficulties. He was weak and powerless, and the Kerala soldiers in his employ 
mutinied for better salaries. Mahinda escaped to Rohana by means of an 
underground passage, and lived at Sīdupabbatagāma with his brother’s wife as 
queen, later marrying his brother’s daughter. Their son was Kassapa, and 
afterwards they lived in Kappagallaka. In the thirty sixth year of Mahinda’s 
reign, the Colas, taking advantage of the discontent in Ceylon, invaded the 
country, capturing the king, the queen, and all the royal regalia. They ruled 
for many years with Pulatthinagara as base, and Mahinda died in Cola after a 
captivity lasting for twelve years (Cv.iv.1ff). Lokitā and Devalā were his 
maternal cousins. Cv.lvii.27.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>17. Mahinda</b>. Son of Moggallāna and Lokitā and 
brother of Kiti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.). Cv.lvii.42.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>18. Mahinda.</b> Son of Vikkamabāhu II. and brother of 
Gajabahu. He fought against Deva, general of Parakkamabāhu I,, at 
Hedillakhandagāma, but was defeated, and fled to Billagāma. From there he went 
to Vallitittha, and was again defeated. Later he joined Mānābharana, and was 
sent by him to Moravāpi, thence to Anurādhapura, where he defeated Mahālekha 
Rakkha and Bhandārapotthakī, who marched against him. From Anurādhapura, Mahinda 
proceeded to Kālavāpi where, for three months, he fought against 
Bhandārapotthakī Bhūta, and was finally defeated by him. This is the last we 
hear of him. Cv.lxii.59; lxxii.46, 82, 123ff., 176ff., 191f., 198ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>19. Mahinda.</b> An officer of Kittisirimegha, sent by 
him to fetch the young Parakkamabāhu. Cv.lxvi. 66.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>20. Mahinda.</b> A Lambakanna in the Morya district, an 
officer of Parakkamabāhu I. He was a Nagaragiri, and was sent by Parakkamabāhu 
to Mallavālāna, where he conducted a victorious campaign against Uttararattha. 
Later he took Anurādhapura, and was one of those responsible for the capture of 
Gajabāhu at Pulatthipura. Cv.lxix. 13; lxx. 89, 146ff.; 158, 199ff.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>22. Mahinda.</b> A minister and kinsman of 
Parakkamabāhu I. He lived in the palace and erected at Pulatthipura a pāsāda for 
the Tooth Relic. Cv.lxxiii.124ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>23. Mahinda.</b> A man of the Kulinga clan, whose wife 
was a cowherd’s daughter called Dīpanī. He killed Vijayabāhu II. and reigned for 
five days, but was slain by Kittinissanka. Cv.lxxx.15ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>24. Mahinda.</b> Son of Sumanadevī and Bodhigutta. He 
came among the escort of the Bodhi tree. Devānampiyatissa conferred on him the
