<p><b>1. Yasuttarā. </b>One of the palaces occupied by Paduma 
Buddha in his last lay life. BuA.146; but see Paduma.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Yasuttarā.</b> A devatā of Tāvatimsa. She had been a 
resident of Bārānasī. She once spun two robes, and, having washed them, she 
offered them to the Buddha. The Buddha accepted the gift and preached to her and 
she became a sotāpanna. After death she was born in Tāvatimsa as Yasuttarā and 
was much loved by Sakka. When she realized that her good fortune was due to her 
faith in the Buddha, she visited him at Jetavana and told him her story. It is 
said that, owing to the power of her merit, she owned a most marvellous 
elephant. Vv.iv.3; VvA.181ff.</p>
