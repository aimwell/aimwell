<p>Once a religious mendicant, clad in a 
leather garment, saw a ram falling back before him, and imagining that the 
animal was doing him obeisance, uttered its praises. The Bodhisatta, who was a 
merchant, hearing this, warned the ascetic that the ram was only preparing to 
attack him, and even as he was speaking the animal charged the mendicant and 
felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk of Sāvatthi, to whom a similar thing happened while he was wearing a 
leather jerkin. J.iii.82ff</p>
