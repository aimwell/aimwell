<p>According to some accounts the city, 
where Mahā Kappina ruled before he became a monk, is called, not Kukkuta (q.v.), 
but Kukkutavatī. Perhaps the former was the name of the county and the latter 
that of its capital. From here to Sāvatthi was a distance of one hundred and 
twenty leagues, and there was a trade route between the two cities which 
merchants travelled on foot (janghavānijā), and also a route from the 
Majjhimadesa. Three rivers had to be crossed on the way: the Aravacchā, the 
Nīlavāhanā and the Candabhāgā. DhA.ii.116ff; a less detailed account is given in 
SA.ii.177f and AA.i.175f.</p>
