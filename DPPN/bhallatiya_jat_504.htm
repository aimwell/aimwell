  <h2>Bhallātiya Jātaka (No.504)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Bhallātiya, king of 
Benares. Desirous of eating venison cooked on charcoal, he gave the kingdom in 
charge of his courtiers and went to the Himālaya on a hunting expedition. While 
wandering about near Gandhamādana, among pleasant streams and groves, he came 
across two kinnaras fondly embracing each other and then weeping and wailing 
most pitifully. The king quieted his hounds, laid down his weapons, and 
approached the kinnaras. In answer to his questions, the female told him that 
one day, while she was picking flowers on the opposite bank for a garland for 
her lover, it grew late and a storm arose. The stream which separated the two 
lovers swelled in flood and they had to spend the night apart from each other. 
The memory of one night, thus passed in separation, had filled them with sorrow 
for six hundred and ninety seven years, and they still wept whenever they 
thought of it.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a quarrel between 
<a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> and <a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a> about conjugal rights. They were sulky and refused to look 
at each other. The Buddha visited the palace and reconciled them. The two 
kinnaras were identified with the king and the queen. J.iv.437ff.</p>
