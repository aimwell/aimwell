<ul>
  <li>
  <h2>Sovīra</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A country mentioned in the Mahāgovinda Sutta (D.ii.235), 
and again in the Aditta Jātaka (J.iii.470; cf. Mil.359, where it is mentioned as 
a place to be visited by sea). </p>
<p>In the time of King Renu, Bharata was king of Sovīra, and 
Roruka was its capital. </p>
<p>Cunningham identifies Sovīra with Eder, a district in the 
province of Gujerat, at the head of the gulf of Cambay. (Anct. Geog. of India, 
p.569f.; he identifies Sauvīra with Sophir or Ophir; cf. Hopkins, Great Epic, 
373, 474.). </p>
<p>The compound Sindhu-Sovīra (E.g., VvA.332) suggests that 
Sovīra was situated between the Indus and the Jhelum.</p>
