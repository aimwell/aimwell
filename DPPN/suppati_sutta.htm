<p>Once, in Veluvana, the Buddha had been walking about for 
the greater part of the night; then having washed his feet and entered his cell, 
he lay down to sleep, and Māra appeared and asked him why he slept. </p>
<p>The Buddha replied that his wishes were the sole arbiter 
in this matter. S.i.107f.</p>
