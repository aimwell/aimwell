<p>A devarāja, the god of rain. He was subject to the will of 
Sakka, and the books contain instances of his causing rain to fall at the 
command of Sakka (J.i.330; Mhv.xxi.31; J.iv.253). </p>
<p>He was also influenced by the exercise of saccakiriyā 
(protestation of truth) E.g., J.i.331f. Buddhaghosa (SA.i.64) describes him as 
Vassavalāhaka, and says that he was an inhabitant of the Cātummahārājika-world. 
Kokanadā and Culla Kokanadā were his daughters (S.i.29f). </p>
<p>Pajjunna is mentioned among the Mahāyakkhas to be invoked 
in time of need (D.iii.205), and he was present at the preaching of the 
Mahāsamaya Sutta. Ibid., ii.260.</p>
