  <h2>Cūla-Sakuladāyi Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha visits Sakuladāyi at the 
Moranivāpa near Rājagaha and their talk turns on perfection. The Buddha points 
out that Sakuladāyi’s conception of perfection is vague and undefined, and 
proves, on examination, empty and faulty. In answer to Sakuladāyi’s question as 
to what the Buddha would define as absolute bliss, the Buddha explains the four 
Jhānas and the destruction of the Āsavas. Sakuladāyi is converted (M.ii.29ff). 
The sutta also contains references to the teachings of Nigantha Nātaputta.</p>
