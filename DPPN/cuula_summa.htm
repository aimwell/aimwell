<p>An eminent Commentator of Ceylon, 
teacher of Tipitaka Cūlanāga. The pupil seems to have disagreed with some of the 
explanations of his teacher — e.g., as to the meaning of ekāyanamagga. Cūlanāga 
said it referred to pubbabhāgasatipatthānamagga, but Cūlasumma held that it 
referred to missakamagga. They could come to no decision; but while on his way 
to the bathing-place, Cūlasumma revolved the problem in his mind, and 
discovering that his pupil was right announced his mistake when Cūlanāga was 
preaching on the day of the first quarter. Cūlanāga, realising how even his 
teacher could go astray on this point, explained it at great length for the 
benefit of future generations (DA.iii.744f.; MA.i.187). The Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.ii.845) calls him Dīpavihāravāsī, while the Vibhanga Commentary (p.489; 
probably Cūlasumma is here a misreading for Cūlasumana) says that he dwelt in 
Ninkaponnapadhānaghara in Cittalapabbata. The Samantapāsādikā (iv.892) says that 
he lived in Rohana.</p>
