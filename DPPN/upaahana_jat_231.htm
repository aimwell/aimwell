<p>Once the Bodhisatta was an 
elephant-trainer and taught his art to a young man of Kāsi. The latter wished to 
take service under the king, but would not accept any fee less than that paid to 
his teacher. A contest of skill was arranged to settle the point. The night 
before the contest the Bodhisatta taught an elephant to do all things awry, 
going back when told to go forward, etc. At the time of the contest the pupil 
could not match this in any way and was defeated and stoned to death by the 
onlookers. The Bodhisatta thereupon declared that a low-bred churl was like an 
ill-made shoe (upāhana). The story was told concerning the base ingratitude of 
Devadatta. J.ii.221ff.</p>
