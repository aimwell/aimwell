<p><b>1. Vasabha. </b>A householder of Kutumbiyangana and 
father of Velusumana. Mhv.xxiii.68.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vasabha. </b>King of Ceylon (127 171 A.C.). He was a 
Lambakanna of Uttarapassa and served under his uncle, the general of King Subha. 
As it was declared by the soothsayers that one named Vasabha would be king, 
Subha ordered the slaughter of all bearing that name and Vasabha’s uncle took 
him to the court to surrender him. But the general’s wife, Potthā, gave her 
husband betel without lime to take with him, and, on the way to the palace, 
Vasabha was sent back to fetch the lime. There Potthā told him of the plot 
against his life, gave him one thousand pieces and helped him to escape. When 
his plans were ready, he fought against Subha, killed both him and his uncle in 
battle and became king. Potthā was made his queen. Soothsayers told him that he 
would live only twelve years, and, after consultation with the monks, Vasabha 
did many acts of merit in order to prolong his life; he reigned for forty four 
years. Among the buildings erected by him were the Mahāvalligotta vihāra, the 
Anurārāma vihāra and the Mucela vihāra. He also built twelve tanks and raised 
the wall of Anurādhapura. His son and successor was Vankannāsikattissa. For 
details of Vasabha’s reign and works, see Dpv.xxii.1ff. and Mhv.xxxv.59ff</p>
<p>It is said (DA.ii.635) that once Vasabha listened to 
Dīghabhānaka monks reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta in the Ambalatthika pāsāda, 
near Lohapāsāda, and applauded the Buddha’s statement contained in the sutta 
that all things are transient. On another occasion he went to the 
Katthakasālaparivena to worship an Elder named Mahāsatthivassa (this may be only 
a descriptive title), but as he approached the door of his cell, he heard the 
Elder’s groans of pain, and, disappointed that he had not yet developed the 
power of suppressing pain even after sixty years of monastic life, the king 
turned away. The Elder was told of this by his attendant, and, putting forth 
great effort, attained arahantship; he thereupon sent for the king. The king lay 
at full length on the ground and worshipped him, saying, “It is not your 
arahantship I worship, but the Sīla you observed as a puthujjana.” (DA.i.291)</p>
<p>Another story is related of Vasabha, of how once, in order 
to test a monk, he sat near him and began to crush a jujube fruit. The monk’s 
mouth watered, and Vasabha knew that he was not an Arahant (MA.ii.869).</p>
<p>Once when Vasabha’s queen was ill, she was cured by 
medicines suggested by Mahāpaduma Thera. Sp.ii.471.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vasabha.</b> A brahmin of Varuna village. His 
daughter gave milk rice to Piyadassī Buddha before his Enlightenment. BuA.172.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vasabha. </b>One of the chief lay supporters of 
Nārada Buddha. Bu.x.25; J.i.37.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vasabha Thera.</b> He belonged to a family of a 
Licchavi rājā of Vesāli and joined the Order when the Buddha visited that town, 
winning arahantship in due course. According to the Apadāna verses quoted, he 
was born in Sāvatthi and was ordained under Sāriputta at the age of seven. Out 
of compassion for his patrons, he enjoyed what he received from them; the common 
minded thereupon deemed him self indulgent. Near him lived a fraudulent monk who 
deceived the people by pretending to live the simple life and was greatly 
honoured by them. Sakka, discerning this, visited Vasabha and questioned him 
concerning the ways of an impostor. The Elder replied in two verses (Thag.139 
40), and Sakka then warned the impostor and departed.</p>
<p>In the past, when the world was without a Buddha, Vasabha 
was a Jatila named Nārada on Samaggapabbata, with a retinue of fourteen 
thousand. Seeing no one deserving of his worship, he made a cetiya of sand on 
the bank of the River Apadikā, in the name of the Buddhas, gilded it and offered 
it his homage. Eighty times he was king of devas and three hundred times king of 
men (ThagA.i.257ff). He is evidently to be identified with Pulinathūpiya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.437f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vasabha.</b> Called Labhiya Vasabha. One of the 
famous warriors of Dutthagāmanī. He was called Labhiya because his body was 
noble in form, “straight like a stick (yatthi).” (MT. 459) When he was twenty 
years old, he started to build a tank with some friends, and he threw away 
masses of earth which would have needed ten or twelve ordinary men to move them. 
Kākavannatissa heard of this and summoned him to the court. The village 
irrigated by the tank was given to him, and it came to be called Vasabhodakavāra. 
Mhv.xxiii.90ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Vasabha.</b> A mountain near Himavā. ThagA.i.182; 
Ap.i.166.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Vasabha.</b> An arahant Thera in 
the time of Padumuttara Buddha, declared foremost for austere practices 
(Ras.i.27). The name is evidently a variant of Nisabha (q.v.).</p>
