<p>The Bodhisatta, was once a wise hermit living in a hut on 
the bend of a river. A pilgrim, a clever disputant, came to try and defeat him 
in debate. But, in answer to his question, the hermit asked him another, and the 
pilgrim was forced to retire discomfited.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a Paribbājaka who 
came to Sāvatthi to debate with the Buddha, but who was forced to own defeat. 
The two disputants were identical. J.ii.257f.</p>
