paid to the Buddha at Jetavana by the devaputta Khema and the verses uttered by 
Khema on that occasion. S.i.57.</p>
<p>2. Khema Sutta.-Two monks, Khema and 
Sumana, living at Andhavana near Sāvatthi, visited the Buddha. Khema stated 
before the Buddha that, when a monk has attained arahantship, the thought does 
not arise in him that he is inferior to anyone or that he has his equal. Having 
spoken thus, Khema took leave of the Buddha and departed; Sumana did likewise. 
When they were gone the Buddha declared to the monks that, by their statement, 
Khema and Sumana had manifested their arahantship. A.iii.358f.</p>
