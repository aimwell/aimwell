<p>An arahant. In the past, ninety-one 
kappas ago, he was a potter of <a href="hamsavatii.htm" title="h/hamsavatii.htm">Hamsavat카</a>, and once gave a well-made bowl of clay 
to the Buddha. As a result, he always had his food in gold and silver bowls 
(Ap.ii.444). </p>
<p>He is probably identical with 
<a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Mah훮cunda
