<p>A thera of Ceylon who had special charge 
of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3). He may be identical with the Tissadatta mentioned 
(VibhA.387, 389; MA.i.234) as being able to preach in eighteen different 
languages, explaining the text of the Tipitaka. </p>
<p>On one occasion, wishing to salute the 
Bodhi-tree by means of his iddhi-power, he caused it to draw near to him.
