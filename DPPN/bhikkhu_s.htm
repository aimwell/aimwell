<hr>
<p><b>1. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> Gains, favours and flattery 
  are a danger even to an arahant unless the freedom of his will is unshakable. 
  S.ii.238.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> Once Moggallāna and Lakkkhana 
  saw a Bhikkhu, born as a peta, going through the air, his body, robes, etc., 
  on fire. He had been a sinful monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha. S.ii.260.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhikkhu Sutta</b>. A monk asks for a teaching in 
  brief and the Buddha tells him that that for which a monk has bias, by that is 
  he reckoned (i.e., he has to give up all bias). The monk dwells in solitude, 
  reflecting on this, and becomes an arahant. S.iii.34f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhikkhu Sutta</b>. Ignorance consists in 
  ignorance of the nature of the body, its arising, its cessation and the way 
  thereto; wisdom is wisdom with regard to these things. The same with the other 
  khandhas. S.iii.162f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Bhikkhu Sutta. </b>The Buddha agrees with a group 
  of monks that if when questioned by other sectarians as to the object of their 
  holiness, they answer that it is the full knowledge of dukkha, their answer is 
  right; he proceeds to tell them what should be their answer if questioned as 
  to what is dukkha. S.iv.50f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells a monk about 
  feelings, their arising and cause, their cessation and the way thereto, etc. 
  S.iv.232.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> A monk asks for a teaching in 
  brief, and the Buddha tells him that he must have truly pure virtue and 
  straight view. Standing on sure virtue, he should cultivate the four 
  satipatthānas; thus will he reach his goal. The monk follows this teaching and 
  becomes an arahant. S.v.142f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Bhikku Sutta.</b> It is by cultivating the four 
  iddhi-pādas that a monk destroys the āsavas. 
  S.v.284.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Bhikkhu Sutta. </b>See Bhaya Sutta (6).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells the monks at 
  Gijjhakūta of seven things, the maintenance of which among the monks will 
  conduce to their progress and save them from desire. A.iv.216.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>11. Bhikkhu Sutta.</b> See also Bhikkhū Sutta.</p>
