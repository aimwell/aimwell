<p><b>1. Aciravatī.</b>-A river, the modern Rāpti 
in Oudh; one of the <a href="pancanadi.htm" title="pa/pancanadi.htm">Pañca-mahānadī</a> (Vin.ii.237), the five great rivers flowing 
from the <a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himālaya</a> eastwards (pācīnaninnā) (S.v.39, etc.) into the sea. During 
the hot season it ran dry, leaving a bed of sand (A.iv.101). It flowed through 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>, and at <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">
Sāvatthi</a> an udumbara grove grew on its banks; it, could be seen 
from the terrace of <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi’s</a> palace (Vin.iv.111-12; SnA.i.19). To the south of 
it was <a href="manasaakata.htm" title="ma/manasaakata.htm">Manasākata</a>, and on its southern bank was a mango grove where the Buddha 
sometimes resided (D.i.235-6). The Tevijja Sutta was preached here, and the 
Aciravatī is used in a simile to prove the futility of sacrifices and prayers: 
it is of no use standing on one bank of the river and calling to the other bank 
to come over.</p>
<p>In the river were many bathing places, 
in some of which courtesans bathed naked; the Bhikkhunīs did likewise until a 
rule was passed prohibiting it (Vin.i.293; iv.278). The 
<a href="chabbaggiyaa.htm" title="c/chabbaggiyaa.htm">Chabbaggiya</a> nuns, 
however, continued to do so even afterwards (Vin.iv.259f).</p>
<p>The river was crossed in rafts 
(Vin.iii.63); it sometimes became so full (D.i.244-5; M.iii.117; J.iv.167) that 
disastrous floods occurred, in one of which <a href="viduudabha.htm" title="vy/viduudabha.htm">Vidūdabha</a> and his army were swept 
into the sea (DhA.i.360).</p>
<p>In sheltered spots monks and brahmins 
used to bathe (Vin.iv.161), and once <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> himself bathed there (AA.i.315). 
The <a href="s5_say.htm#Sattarasavaggiya" title="s/s5_say.htm#Sattarasavaggiya">Sattarasa-vaggiya</a> monks frequented the river for water-sports 
(Vin.iv.111-12).</p>
<p>Once the Buddha was told that the 
<a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiya</a> monks were in the habit of seizing the cows that crossed the river 
(Vin.i.191).</p>
<p>The elder <a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sivalī</a> stopped on the banks of 
the Aciravatī while on his way to the Himālaya with five hundred monks 
(AA.i.139). In the time of Kassapa Buddha the river flowed round Sāvatthi and, 
at the eastern fort, flowed into a wide and deep lake on which separate bathing 
places were made for the king, the people, the Buddha and the Order respectively 
(MA.i.371).</p>
<p>The people on the banks were in the 
habit of casting nets for fish (UdA.366). Near the river was 
<a href="dandakappaka.htm" title="d/dandakappaka.htm">Dandakappa</a>, a 
Kosalan village, and while staying there Ānanda bathed in the river with many 
other monks (A.iii.402).</p>
<p>Two occasions are mentioned on which 
monks hit in the eye swans flying over the river (J.i.418 and ii.366. See also 
DhA.iv.5 and 8f). It was here that <a href="patacara.htm" title="pa/patacara.htm">Patācārā’s</a> child was drowned (DhA.ii.264).</p>
<p><a href="kapila.htm#4" title="ka/kapila.htm#4">Kapila</a> was born here as a golden fish as 
a result of his evil deeds (DhA.iv.41; see also 
<a href="k3_kay.htm#Kapila_s" title="ka/k3_kay.htm#Kapila_s">Kapila S</a>). In the Avadāna Sataka 
(DhA.i.63; also ii.60) the name is given as Aciravatī, and according to I Tsing 
(p.156) means the river of the Aji (dragon).</p>

<p><b>2. Aciravati.</b>-A canal which ran 
westwards from the Mahāvāluka-gangā in Ceylon; from it flowed four other canals 
eastwards: the Sataruddhā, Nibbindā, Dhavalā and Sīdā. Cv.lxxix.51-3.</p>
