<p><a href="bhuumija_th.htm" title="b/bhuumija_th.htm">Bhūmija</a> once went to the house of his nephew 
<a href="jayasena.htm" title="j/jayasena.htm">Jayasena</a> in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>.</p>
<p><a href="jayasena.htm" title="j/jayasena.htm">Jayasena</a> questioned him about the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> teaching, and, pleased with 
what he heard, entertained Bhūmija to a meal.  </p>
<p>Bhūmija reported this to the 
Buddha, who approved of what he had said to Jayasena and further developed the 
theme. </p>
<p>Right outlook is absolutely essential to the winning of 
the fruits of the higher life; it is just as impossible to get oil out of sand 
or milk from a cow’s horn at it is to obtain the fruits of higher life with a 
wrong outlook. M.iii.138ff.</p>
