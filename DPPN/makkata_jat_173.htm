<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a learned brahmin of Kāsi, and, 
when his wife died, he retired with his son to the Himālaya, where they lived 
the ascetic life. One day during a heavy shower of rain, a monkey, wishing to 
gain admission to the ascetics' hut, put on the bark dress of a dead ascetic and 
stood outside the door. The son wished to admit him, but the Bodhisatta 
recognised the monkey and drove him a way. The boy is identified with Rāhula 
(J.ii.68 f).</p>
<p>The circumstances in which the story was related are given 
in the Uddāla Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
