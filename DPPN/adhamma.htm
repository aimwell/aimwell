<p>A Kāmāvacara god, Devadatta, in a 
previous birth. </p>
<p>He appeared to men on fast days and 
admonished them to lead evil lives. </p>
<p>Once he met Dhamma (the Bodhisatta), and 
the two had a discussion in mid-air, at the end of which Adhamma plunged 
headlong into hell (J.iv.100-3).</p>
<p>His vehicle was called Adhammayāna.</p>
