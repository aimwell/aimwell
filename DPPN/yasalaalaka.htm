  <h2>Yasalālaka, Tissa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Younger brother of Candamukha Siva. He killed Siva at the 
festival sports at Tissavāpi and ruled as king for seven years and eight months 
(112-20 A.C.). His gate watchman, Subha, bore a strong 
resemblance to him, and Tissa would sometimes deck Subha in all his royal 
ornaments and place him on the throne, where all the nobles of the court paid 
him homage, thinking him to be the king, Tissa, meanwhile, enjoying the fun, as 
watchman. One day, as Tissa stood at the door, laughing to himself, Subha 
charged him with impertinence and ordered the guard to slay him. Mhv.xxxv.49ff.; 
Dpv.xxi.46.</p>
