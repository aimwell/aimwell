  <h2>Mahāariyavamsa Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On the four Ariyan lineages, reckoned as ancient and pure, 
and held in esteem by discerning recluses and brahmins of all times. A monk is 
content with any kind of robe; he does not, for the sake of robes, resort to 
unseemly conduct; he is free from either selfishness or greed with regard to 
robes; neither does he exalt himself because of his contentment. So it is with 
other requisites. He also delights in abandoning and in bhāvanā. A monk 
possessed of these four Ariyavamsā verily becomes a sage, praised by Brahmā 
himself (A.ii.27ff).</p>
<p>This sutta was evidently a favourite topic for a sermon 
(AA.i.385, 386). The Commentary explains (AA.ii.494) how, for instance, anyone 
who preaches on the first three Ariyavamsā (catupaccayasantosa) could bring the 
whole Vinaya Pitaka to bear on the discussion, while a discussion on the 
bhāvanārāma-ariyavamsa could include the two other Pitakas, chiefly the 
nekkhammapāli of the Patisambhidāmagga, the Dasuttara Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, 
the Satipatthāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the Niddesapariyāya of the 
Abhidhamma.</p>
<p>The full name of the sutta seems to have been 
Catupaccayasantosabhāvanārāma Mahāariyavamsa Sutta (AA.i.385). It was also 
probably called Vamsa Sutta for short.</p>
<p>It is probably this Mahāariyavamsa Sutta which was held in 
such high esteem by Vohāraka Tissa, that he ordered almsgiving throughout Ceylon 
whenever the “Ariyavamsa” was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; but see Mhv.Trs.258, n. 6). It 
is said that people would journey five yojanas to hear a monk preach the 
Ariyavamsa (E.g., AA.i.386), and mention is made of Mahāariyavamsabhānakā, who, 
judging from the stories of them (E.g., SA.iii.151), were extremely able and 
eloquent preachers.</p>
