<p>A brahmin of Sāvatthi.  </p>
<p>He visited the Buddha at Jetavana 
and the Buddha preached to him the <a href="cuula_saaropama_s.htm" title="c/cuula_saaropama_s.htm">Cūla Sāropama Sutta</a>, at the end of which he 
declared himself the Buddha’s follower (M.i.198ff). </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.422) 
that the man’s name was Koccha, and that he was called Pingala because he was 
tawny (pingaladhātuko).</p>
