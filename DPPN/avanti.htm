  <h2>Avanti</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the four great 
monarchies in the time of the Buddha, the other three being 
<a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a>, <a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a> and
<a href="vamsaa.htm" title="va/vamsaa.htm">Vamsa</a> (or Vatsa).  </p>
<p>Avanti is also mentioned among the 
sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadā</a> 
(A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260).  </p>
<p>Its capital was <a href="ujjenii.htm" title="u/ujjenii.htm">Ujjenī</a>. But according to 
another account (D.ii.235), Māhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for 
some time, the capital of Avanti. It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was 
divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the 
southern part (also called <b>Avanti Dakkhināpatha</b>) at Māhissati (Māhismatī) (Bhandarkar: 
Carmichael Lectures (1918), p.54). This theory is supported by the fact that in 
the Mahābhārata (ii.31, 10), Avanti and Māhismatī are referred to as two 
different countries.</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time, the King of Avanti 
was Pajjota, a man of violent temper (Vin.i.277), and therefore known as 
<a href="cannda_ppajjota.htm" title="c/cannda_ppajjota.htm">Canda 
Pajjota</a>. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which 
Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated. Instead, 
his daughter <a href="vaasuladattaa.htm" title="va/vaasuladattaa.htm">Vāsuladattā</a> became Udena’s wife and the two countries continued to 
be on friendly terms. The romantic story of this marriage is given in 
DhA.i.191ff. For a summary see <a href="vaasuladattaa.htm" title="va/vaasuladattaa.htm">Vāsuladattā</a>. </p>
<p>The kingdom of Assaka is invariably 
mentioned in connection with Avanti. Even in the Buddha’s life-time, Avanti 
became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born 
or resided there, are to be found  </p>

</ul>
<p>It is said that when Pajjota heard of 
the Buddha’s advent to the world, he sent his chaplain’s son, Kaccāna, with 
seven others, to invite him to Avanti.</p>
<p>Having listened to the Buddha’s 
teaching, the messengers became arahants, and when Kaccāna conveyed to the 
Buddha the king’s invitation to Avanti, he was asked by the Buddha to return and 
represent him. Kaccāna returned to Avanti and converted Pajjota to the faith of 
the Buddha (ThagA.i.485). Henceforward Mahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good 
deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta 
Pabbata (S.iii.9, 12; iv.115-16; A.v.46; also UdA.307).</p>
<p>The religion thus introduced, however, 
does not seem to have spread to any extent until much later; for we find Mahā 
Kaccāna experiencing great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that 
Sona Kutikanna might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until 
three years had elapsed that he succeeded (Vin.i.195). Later, when Sona 
Kutikanna visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā 
Kaccāna’s request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of 
the monks of Avanti Dakkhināpatha and of, other border countries (Vin.i.197-8). 
The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) The 
higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. </li>
  <li>(2) 
Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the 
soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle). </li>
  <li>(3) Monks are 
enjoined to bathe frequently (the men of Avanti attaching great importance to 
bathing). </li>
  <li>(4) Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. </li>
  <li>(5) Robes 
could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten 
days' rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have 
actually reached the monk’s hands (Cp. the first nissaggiya rule, Vin.iii.195-6) 
(this, evidently, because of difficulty of access).</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time of the Vesāli Council, 
however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, 
for we find <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa Kākandakaputta</a> sending messengers to Avanti to call 
representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants 
obeyed the summons (Vin.ii.298-9).</p>
<p>Among other localities in Avanti 
(besides those mentioned above) were Ghanaselapabbata, Makkarakata and Velugāma, 
and, in Jaina works, we find mention also of Sudarsanapura (Law: Ksatriya 
Tribes, p.148).</p>
<p>Even in the Buddha’s day there were 
rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Magadha, but we are 
not told that he ever did so (E.g.,M.iii.7). Subsequently, however, before the 
time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Magadha. Before Asoka became 
King of Magadha he was the Magadha Viceroy of Avanti and ruled in Ujjeni, and it 
was in Ujjeni that Mahinda and Sanghamittā were born and grew up (Mhv.xiii.8ff). 
But the country seems to have retained its name at least as late as the second 
century A.D., as may be seen from Rudradāman’s Inscription at Junagadh (Buddhist 
India, p.28).</p>
<p>Avanti is now identified with the 
country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly 
corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central 
Provinces (Law: Geography of Early Buddhism, p.22).</p>
<p>In the Milindapañha (Trs.ii.250, n.1) 
Avanti is mentioned as one of the three mandalas or great divisions of 
<a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>, 
the other two being Pācīna and Dakkhināpatha.</p>
<p>According to a late tradition recorded 
in the <a href="buddhavamsa.htm" title="b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> (Bu.xxviii.10), the Buddha’s mat (nisīdana) and rug were 
deposited, after his death, in Avanti.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been suggested that 
Avanti was the home of modern Pāli (E.g.,in Bud. India, pp.153-4). It has 
further been suggested that the Avanti school of monks — founded by Mahā 
Kaccāna, who was considered the greatest analytical exponent of the Buddha’s 
time — living in comparative isolation (as seen above) on account of difficulty 
of access (Avanti, however, lay on the road taken by <a href="bavari.htm" title="b/bavari.htm">Bāvari’s</a> ten disciples on 
their way from Patitthāna to Sāvatthi), and laying special stress on dhutavāda 
practices (Vin.ii.299) — developed branches of knowledge dealing mainly with 
grammar and doctrinal interpretation by ways of exegetical analysis. The Pāli 
grammar ascribed to Kaccāyana and the Netti-ppakarana were both works of this 
school. For a discussion of this see PLC.181ff </p>
<p>Avanti was one of the parts into which 
the earth was divided by King Renu, with the help of his Great Steward, Mahā-Govinda. 
The King of Avanti at the time was Vessabhū and his capital Māhissati. 
D.ii.235-6.</p>

<p><b>2. Avanti.</b>-King of Ujjeni in a past age. 
During his reign the Bodhisatta was born, under the name of Citta, in a Candāla 
village outside Ujjeni. His story is related in the
