<p>A town in Kosala, near the Himālaya. It 
has been given, free from all taxes (as brahmadeyya), to Pokkharasātī by the 
king of Kosala, in recognition of the former’s skill. It was thickly populated 
and had much grassland, woodland and corn (D.i.87; DA.i.245). The Icchānangala 
wood was in the neighbourhood, and when the Buddha was staying in the wood 
Pokkharasātī first sent his pupil Ambattha and then went himself to visit the 
Buddha (see the Ambattha Sutta).</p>
<p>There was a road which connected 
Ukkatthā with Setavyā (A.ii.37) and with Vesāli (J.ii.259). Chatta goes from 
Setavyā to Ukkatthā to learn under Pokkharasātī (VvA.229).</p>
<p>It was in the Subhagavana at Ukkatthā 
that the Mūlapariyāya Sutta (M.i.1ff) was preached and the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka 
(J.ii.259ff) was related in connection with it. Ukkatthā was the residence of 
Anganika-Bhāradvāja (ThagA.339).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.i.9; AA.ii.504) 
that the city was so called because it was built by the light of torches (ukkā) 
at night, in order that it might be completed within the auspicious time.</p>
<p>In the Brahmanimantika Sutta (M.i.326; 
but see S.i.142; J.iii.359), the Buddha says that it was while he was residing 
at Subhagavana that be became aware of the erroneous views of Baka-brahma and 
went to the Brahma-world to teach Baka the truth. The Divyāvadāna calls the city 
Ukkatā (p.621).</p>
