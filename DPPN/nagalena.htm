<p>A cave in Kotlpabbata vihāra. A novice once recited there 
the Mahāsamaya Sutta, and a goddess, in the nāga tree outside, applauded him. 
She had been present when the Buddha preached the sutta when, she said, the 
concourse of devas was so great that she could get a foothold only in the sea 
near Mahagāma in Ceylon; yet she could see and hear the Buddha distinctly.
