  <h2>Ekasātaka</h2>

<p>A very poor brahmin who lived in the 
time of Vipassī Buddha. He was so called because he and his wife had, between 
them, only one upper garment, worn by whichever of them happened to be going 
out. The Buddha was in the habit of preaching every seven years. On one such 
occasion the brahmin listened to the Buddha’s sermon, and being greatly pleased, 
wishing to make an offering, he gave the Buddha his upper garment after a hard 
mental struggle as to whether he could afford the gift. Having made the gift, he 
shouted with joy saying, “I have won.” The king of the city, Bandhumā, having 
heard the shout and learnt the reason, gave to the brahmin various rich gifts, 
including the sabbatthaka (*), all of which the latter presented to the Buddha, 
keeping, at the king’s special request, a single pair of garments for himself 
and his wife. The king later made Ekasātaka his chaplain (AA.i.92ff; also 
ThagA.ii.136).</p>
<p>The sabbatthaka seems to have been a 
gift of various things in groups of eight: eight elephants, eight horses, eight 
thousand pieces of money, etc. (DhA.iii.3); but see Mil.Trs.ii.147, n.1, where 
it is spoken of as an office.</p>
<p>Ekasātaka is given in the Anguttara 
Commentary (loc. cit.) as a previous birth of the Elder Mahā Kassapa. The 
Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.1ff) mentions another brahmin, Culla-Ekasātaka by 
name. He is, however, stated as having lived in the time of Gotama Buddha, 
although the story related is, in most respects, identical with that given 
above, except that the king in the story of Culla-Ekasātaka is Pasenadi, king of 
Kosala. No mention is made of the brahmin being created purohita. Moreover, this 
brahmin received as gift only the sabbacatukka (groups of four) and not the 
sabatthaka. More important still, Culla Ekasātaka is identified with Mahā 
Ekasātaka, the latter being mentioned as having lived in the time of Vipassī 
Buddha. Here we evidently have a confusion of legends.</p>
<p>The story of Ekasātaka is related in the 
Milindapañha (pp.115, 291), as one of seven cases in which an act of devotion 
received its reward in this very life.</p>
