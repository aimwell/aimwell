<hr>
<p><b>1. Sanghadāsī. </b>The youngest of the seven daughters 
of Kiki, king of Benares. She was Visākhā in the present age (J.vi.481). One 
day, as she was giving the five products of the cow to a company of twenty 
thousand monks, she persuaded them to accept her gifts even when they covered 
their bowls, saying: “Enough, enough.” For this reason, when, as Visākhā, she 
was given cattle by her father at the time of her marriage, other herds of 
cattle joined them, in spite of the efforts of men to prevent them (DhA.i.396f., 
418).</p>
<p>The Apadāna, however, gives her name as Sanghadāyikā. 
Ap.ii.655 (vs. 16).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sanghadāsī.</b> An eminent nun of Jambudīpa. 
Dpv.xviii.10.</p>
