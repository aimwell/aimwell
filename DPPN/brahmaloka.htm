  <h2>Brahmlakoka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The highest of the celestial worlds, the abode of the 
Brahmas. It consists of twenty heavens: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the nine ordinary Brahma-worlds,
  </li>
  <li>the five Suddhāvāsā, </li>
  <li>the four Arūpa worlds, </li>
  <li>the Asaññasatta and </li>
  <li>the Vehapphala (e.g., VibhA.521). </li>
</ul>
<p>All except the four Arūpa worlds are classed among the 
Rūpa worlds (the inhabitants of which are corporeal). The inhabitants of the 
Brahma worlds are free from sensual desires (but see the Mātanga Jātaka, 
J.iv.378, where Ditthamangalikā is spoken of as Mahābrahmabhariyā, showing that 
some, at least, considered that Mahābrahmas had wives). </p>
<p>The Brahma world is the only world devoid of women 
(DhA.i.270); women who develop the jhānas in this world can be born among the 
Brahmapārisajjā (see below), but not among the Mahābrahmas (VibhA.437f). Rebirth 
in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue accompanied by meditation 
(Vsm.415). The Brahmas, like the other celestials, are not necessarily sotāpanna 
or on the way to complete knowledge (sambodhi-parāyanā); 
their attainments depend on the degree of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma 
and the Sangha. See, e.g., A.iv.76f.; it is not necessary to be a follower of 
the Buddha for one to be born in the Brahma world; the names of six teachers are 
given whose followers were born in that world as a result of listening to their 
teaching (A.iii.371ff.; iv.135ff.). </p>
<p>The Jātakas contain numerous accounts of ascetics who 
practised meditation, being born after death in the Brahma world (e.g., J.ii.43, 
69, 90; v.98, etc.). Some of the Brahmas — e.g., 
Baka (q.v.)&nbsp;-&nbsp; held false views regarding their world, which, like all 
other worlds, is subject to change and destruction (M.i.327). When the rest of 
the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Brahma world is saved 
(Vsm.415; KhpA.121), and the first beings to be born on earth come from the Ābhassara Brahma world (Vsm.417). Buddhas and their more eminent disciples often 
visit the Brahma worlds and preach to the inhabitants. E.g., M.i.326 f.; 
ThagA.ii.184ff.; Sikhī Buddha and Abhibhū are also said to have visited the 
Brahma world (A.i.227f.). The Buddha could visit it both in his mind made body 
and his physical body (S.v.282f.). </p>
<p>If a rock as big as the gable of a house were to be 
dropped from the lowest Brahma-world it would take four months to reach the earth 
travelling one hundred thousand leagues a day. Brahmas subsist on trance, 
abounding in joy (sappītikajjhāna), this being their sole food. SA.i.161; food 
and drinks are offered to Mahābrahmā, and he is invited to partake of these, but 
not of sacrifices (SA.i.158 f.). Anāgāmins, who die before attaining 
arahantship, are reborn in the Suddhāvāsā Brahma-worlds 
and there pass away entirely (see, e.g., S.i.35, 60, and Compendium v.10). The 
beings born in the lowest Brahma world are called Brahma-pārisajjā; 
their life term is one third of an asankheyya kappa; next to them come the 
Brahma-purohitā, who live for half an asankheyya 
kappa; and beyond these are the Mahā Brahmas who live for a whole asankheyya 
kappa (Compendium, v.6; but see VibhA.519f., where Mahā Brahmās are defined).</p>
<p>The term Brahmakāyikā-devā seems 
to be used as a classs-name for all the inhabitants of 
the Brahma-worlds (A.i.210; v.76f).  </p>
<p>The Mahā Niddesa 
Commentary (p.109) says that the word includes all the five (?) kinds 
of Brahmā (sabbe pi pañca vokāra Brahmāno gahitā).  </p>
<p> The 
BuA.p.10 thus defines the word Brahmā: brūhito tehi tehi gunavisesahī ti=Brahmā. 
Ayam pana Brahmasaddo Mahā-Brahma-brāhmana-Thathāgata 
mātāpitu-setthādisu dissati.  </p>
<p>The Samantapāsādikā 
(i.131) speaks of a Mahā Brahmā who was a khināsava, living for sixteen thousand 
kappas. When the Buddha, immediately after his birth, looked around and took his 
steps northward, it was this Brahmā who seized the babe by his finger and 
assured him that none was greater than he.</p>
<p>The names of several Brahmās occur in the books — 
e.g., 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tudu</li>
  <li>Nārada</li>
  <li>Ghatikāra</li>
  <li>Baka</li>
  <li>Sanankumāra</li>
  <li>Sahampatī</li>
</ul>
<p>To these should 
be added the names of seven Anāgāmīs resident in Avihā and other Brahma worlds&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upaka, 
</li>
  <li>Phalagandu, 
</li>
  <li>Pukkusāti, 
</li>
  <li>Bhaddiya, 
</li>
  <li>Khandadeva, 
</li>
  <li>Bāhuraggi and 
</li>
  <li>Pingiya 
(S.i.35, 60; SA.i.72 etc.). 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Baka speaks of seventy two Brahmās, living, apparently, in 
his world, as his companions (S.i.142).
</p>
<p>See also Tissa Brahmā.
</p>
<p>These are described as Mahā Brahmās. Mention is also made 
of Pacceka Brahmās — e.g., Subrahmā and 
Suddhavāsa (S.i.146f).  </p>
<p>Tudu is also sometimes described as a Pacceka Brahmā 
(e.g., S.i.149). Of the Pacceka Brahmās, Subrahmā and Suddhavāsa are represented 
as visiting another Brahmā, who was infatuated with his own power and glory, and 
as challenging him to the performance of miracles, excelling him therein and 
converting him to the faith of the Buddha. Tudu is spoken of as exhorting 
Kokālika to put his trust in Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Loc. 
Cit.)</p>
<p>No explanation is given of the term Pacceka Brahmā. Does 
it mean Brahmās who dwelt apart, by themselves? Cp. Pacceka-Buddha.</p>
<p>The Brahmās are represented as visiting the earth and 
taking an interest in the affairs of men. Thus, Nārada descends from the Brahma-world 
to dispel the heresies of King Angati (J.vi.242f). When the Buddha hesitates to 
preach his doctrine, because of its profundity, it is Sahampati (q.v.) who 
visits him and begs him to preach it for the welfare of the world. The 
explanation given (e.g., at SA.i.155) is that the Buddha waited for the 
invitation of Sahampati that it might lend weight to his teaching. The people 
were followers of Brahmā, and Sahampati’s acceptance of the Buddha’s leadership 
would impress them deeply. </p>
<p>Sahampatī is mentioned as visiting the Buddha several 
times subsequently, illuminating Jetavana with the effulgence of his body. It is 
said that with a single finger he could illuminate a whole Cakkavāla (SA.i.158). 
Sanankumāra (q.v.) was also a follower of the Buddha. The Brahmās appear to have 
been in the habit of visiting the deva worlds too, for Sanankumāra is reported 
as being present at an assembly of the Tāvatimsa gods and as speaking there the 
Buddha’s praises and giving an exposition of his teaching. But, in order to do 
this, he assumed the form of Pañcasikha (D.ii.211ff).</p>
<p>The books refer (e.g., at D.i.18, where Brahmā is 
described as vasavattī issaro kattā nimmātā, etc.) to the view held, at the 
Buddha’s time, of Brahmā as the creator of the universe and of union with Brahmā 
as the highest good, only to be attained by prayers and sacrifices. But the 
Buddha himself did not hold this view amid does not speak of any single Brahmā 
as the highest being in all creation. See, however, A.v.59f., where Mahā Brahmā, 
is spoken of as the highest denizen of the Sahassalokadhātu (yāvatā 
sahassalokadhātu, Mahā-Brahmā tattha aggam akkhāyati); but he, too, is 
impermanent (Mahā-Brahmūno pi . . . atthi eva aññathattam, atthi viparināmo).
</p>
<p>There are Mahā Brahmās, mighty and powerful (abhibhū 
anabhibhūto aññadatthudaso vasavattī), but they too, all of them, and their 
world are subject to the laws of Kamma. E.g., at S.v.410 (Brahmaloko pi āvuso 
anicco adhuvo sakkāyapariyāpanno sādhāyasmā Brahmalokā cittam vutthāpetvā 
sakkāyanirodhacittam upasamharāhi). See also A.iv.76f., 104f., where Sunetta, in 
spite of all his great powers as Mahā Brahmā, etc., had to confess himself still 
subject to suffering. </p>
<p>To the Buddha, union with Brahmā seems to have meant being 
associated with him in his world, and this can only be attained by cultivation 
of those qualities possessed by the Brahmā. But the highest good lay beyond, in 
the attainment of Nibbāna. Thus in the Tevijjā Sutta; see also M.ii.194f.</p>
<p>The word Brahma is often used in compounds meaning highest 
and best — e.g., Brahmacariyā, Brahmassara; for 
details see Brahma in the New Pāli Dictionary.</p>
