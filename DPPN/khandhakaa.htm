  <h2>Khandhakā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a portion of the 
Vinaya Pitaka. This is generally further divided into two parts, </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>the Mahāvagga</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>the Cullavagga</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It contains an attempt to give a coherent picture of the 
whole legal life of the Sangha, with detailed and connected accounts of the 
admission thereto, the ceremony of the uposatha, the annually recurring 
observances connected with the rainy season, etc. An account is given, in the 
case of each regulation, of the occasion on which it was formulated by the 
Buddha. The separate chapters are arranged in chronological order, and are 
intended to present a connected account of ecclesiastical history from the time 
of the Enlightenment of the Buddha down to that of the Second Council, convened 
one hundred years after the death of the Buddha. (See Oldenberg, Vinaya Pitaka 
I., Introd., xxii.f.; Law, Pāli Lit., i.14f). </p>
<p>In many ways the Khandhakā, resemble the 
Sutta Vibhanga of the Vinaya, but while in the case of the Vibhanga the stories 
were added later to an original basis of regulations, the Pātimokkha, in that of 
the Khandhakā the regulations and the stories were contemporary.</p>
<p>The Khandhakas consist of eighty 
bhānavāras (DA.i.13), and are divided into twenty-two chapters, ten in the 
Mahāvagga and twelve in the Cullavagga. Each chapter is called a khandhaka. 
Thus, the first chapter is the Mahākhandaka; the second, the Uposathakhandhaka, 
and so on.</p>
