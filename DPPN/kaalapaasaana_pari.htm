<p>A building attached to the Tissārāma in 
the Nandanavana in Anurādhapura, erected for the use of Mahinda. 
Devānampiyatissa was anxious that there should be no delay in erecting the 
building, and therefore had the necessary bricks dried with torches for the sake 
of speed. The building was dark in colour, hence its name (Mhv.xv.203f; MT.363). 
There was once a pond near the gate of the parivena, called Marutta. MT.344f</p>
