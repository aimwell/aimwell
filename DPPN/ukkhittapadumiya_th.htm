<p>An arahant. </p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had 
been a garland-maker of Hamsavatī. Once while he was picking lotuses in a pond, 
the Buddha appeared before him with numerous disciples. The garland-maker picked 
a lotus and threw it up into the air, wishing it to remain above the Buddha’s 
head; by the Buddha’s power it did thus remain. As a result, the garland-maker 
was reborn in Tāvatimsa in a palace named Satapatta. </p>
<p>A thousand times he was king of the 
devas and five hundred times king of men. Ap.i.275f.</p>
