<p>A lay-disciple of the Buddha in 
Sāvatthi. He was present when five rājās, including Pasenadi, visited the Buddha 
and asked him which was the highest sensual pleasure. When the Buddha had 
answered their question, Candanangalika obtained his permission and uttered 
averse in his praise. The rājās thereupon gave Candanangala five robes which he 
presented to the Buddha (S.i.81f).</p>
<p>The story is very similar to that of the 
brahmin Pingiyāni and the verse spoken is the same. A.iii.239.</p>
