  <h2>Haliddirāga Jātaka (No. 435)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The story is very similar to that of the Culla-Nārada 
Jātaka (q.v.). The girl tried to seduce the young ascetic when his father was 
away and take him back with her to the haunts of men, but he told her to go on, 
saying that he would follow after taking leave of his father. When the latter 
heard his story and learnt his intention, he exhorted the youth not to be 
ensnared by thoughts of lust. His son realized his folly and remained in the 
hermitage. J.iii.524-6.</p>
