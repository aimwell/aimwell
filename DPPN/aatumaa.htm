<p>A town that lay between Kusinārā and 
Sāvatthi. Once the Buddha, with a large company of bhikkhus, visited the town. 
At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life (a 
buddhapabbajita, identified by Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.599) with the buddhapabbajita 
Subhadda) and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and 
well versed in the barber’s art. When the monk heard of the Buddha’s coming, he 
sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal. The 
young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of 
each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in 
the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him. The Buddha, 
however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had 
been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that it was 
declared to be a dukkata offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to 
carry about with him a barber’s equipment (Vin.i.249-50).</p>
<p>In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta 
(D.ii.131-2) the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was 
staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā. There was a thunderstorm and two peasants 
(brothers) and four oxen were struck by lightning. A large number of people 
having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of 
the accident. But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had 
neither seen nor heard anything of it. Such was the state of calm of his mind.</p>
