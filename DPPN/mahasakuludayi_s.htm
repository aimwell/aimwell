<h2>Mahāsakuludāyī Sutta</h2>
<p>The Buddha visits the hermitage of 
<a href="sakuladaayii.htm" title="sa/sakuladaayii.htm">Sakuludāyī</a> near 
Rājagaha. Sakuludāyi tells him that the Buddha, unlike other religious teachers, 
is honoured by his disciples, and gives it as his opinion that this is because 
the Buddha eats sparingly, is content with any raiment, accepts any alms, is 
satisfied with any lodging, lives in seclusion, and counsels others to do 
likewise. The Buddha answers that if the esteem shown him depends on these 
qualities, he has numerous disciples more austere than himself with regard to 
these practices, and gives five other qualities which have won for him esteem: 
he has the higher virtues, outstandingly keen vision, super eminent intellect, 
he teaches his disciples the Noble Truths, and shows them the way in which to develop the four <i>satipatthāna.</i></p>
<p>He has taught them, besides,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the four <i>sammāppadhānas,</i>
</li>
  <li>the four <i>iddhipādas,</i>
  </li>
  <li>the five <i>indriyas,</i>
  </li>
  <li>the five <i>bala,</i>
  </li>
  <li>the seven <i>bojjhangas,</i> 
  </li>
  <li>the Noble Eightfold Path, <i>magga</i></li>
  <li>the eight Deliverances <i>(vimokkha),</i>
  </li>
  <li>the eight spheres of mastery <i>(abhibhāyatamas),</i>
 
</li>
  <li>the ten <i>kasināyatanas, </i></li>
  <li>the four <i>jhānas,</i></li>
  <li>the sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It is for these reasons that his disciples esteem him. M.ii.1</p>
