<p><b>1. GayÄ.-</b>A pond in which people bathed, 
that their sins might be washed away (J.v.388f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.145) it 
was a circular pond in which was a bathing ghat (mandavÄpisanthÄnam tittham). 
But see below, GayÄ (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. GayÄ.</b>-A town in India. It lay on the 
road between the Bodhi-tree and <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, and was three gÄvutas from the Bodhi-tree 
and fifteen yojanas from Benares. (MA.i.387f; Fa Hien says the distance from the 
Bodhi-tree to GayÄ, was twenty li, or about 3 1/3 miles). It was between the 
<a href="bodhimanda.htm" title="b/bodhimanda.htm">Bodhimanda</a> and GayÄ that the Buddha, on his way to 
<a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>, met <a href="upaka.htm" title="u/upaka.htm">Upaka</a> 
(Vin.i.8).  </p>
<p>The Buddha stayed at GayÄ on several occasions: once at 
<a href="gayaasiisa.htm" title="g/gayaasiisa.htm">GayÄsÄ«sa</a> 
(Vin.i.34; S.iv.19; A.iv.302), and also near the <a href="tankitamanca.htm" title="t/tankitamanca.htm">TankitamaÃ±ca</a> (Sn. p.47; 
S.i.207, etc.), the residence of <a href="suciloma.htm" title="s/suciloma.htm">Suciloma</a>.</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says that GayÄ was the name 
given both to the village and a bathing ghat near to it (also called 
GayÄpokkharanÄ«). Dhamma-pÄla (UdA.74, 75; cp. SNA.i.301), on the other hand, 
speaks of a GayÄnadÄ« and a GayÄpokkharanÄ« as being two distinct bathing ghats, 
both commonly called GayÄtittha, and both considered to possess the power of 
washing away sins. People went there, offered sacrifices to the gods, recited 
the Vedas, and immersed themselves in the water.</p>
<p>Elsewhere (ThagA.i.388f, 418; 
Thag.v.287) it is stated that every year, in the earlier half of the month of 
Phagguna (March), people held a bathing festival at the bathing ghat at GayÄ, 
the festival being called GayÄphaggunÄ«. It was at one of these festivals that 
<a href="senaka.htm" title="s/senaka.htm">Senaka Thera</a> was converted by the Buddha. This explanation of GayÄphaggu is, 
perhaps, not quite correct, for, according to some, the river (NeraÃ±jarÄ) which 
ran by GayÄ was itself called Phaggu (Skt. Phaggu). E.g., Cunningham: AGI.524; 
Böthlinck and Rothâ€™s Dict. s.v. Phalgu; Neumann (Majh. N. Trans.i.271) says that 
the village of GayÄ itself was called Phaggu.</p>
<p>The town of GayÄ is often called 
BrahmagayÄ to distinguish it from BuddhagayÄ (q.v.).</p>
