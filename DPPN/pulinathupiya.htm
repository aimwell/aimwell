<p>An arahant. Once, in the past, he was a Jatila named 
Nārada, with fourteen thousand followers, living near the rock called Samanga. 
He erected, on the bank of the Amarikā, a thūpa of sand as an object of worship 
for himself. </p>
<p>In his last birth he was of parents who were devout 
followers of the Buddha and worshipped at a shrine erected in the Buddha’s name. 
When the boy was seven years old he saw the shrine and, recalling his past, 
became an arahant (Ap.ii.437 ff). </p>
<p>He is perhaps to be identified with Vasabha Thera (q.v.). 
Thag.A.i.258f.</p>
