  <h2>Manoja Jātaka (No. 397)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a lion and had a son called Manoja. 
One day Manoja, in spite of his father’s warnings, made friends with a jackal 
called Giriya. Acting on Giriya’s suggestion, Manoja went in search of horse 
flesh and attacked the king’s horses, The king engaged the services of an 
archer, who shot Manoja as he was making off with a horse. Manoja managed to 
reach his den, but there he fell down dead (J.iii.321ff).</p>
<p>The circumstances in which the story was related are 
similar to those of the Mahilāmukha Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
