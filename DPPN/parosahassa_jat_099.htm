<p>Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic in the Himālaya, leader 
of five hundred ascetics. His chief disciple was away at the time of his (the 
Bodhisatta’s) death, and when his other disciples asked him, just before his 
death, what excellence he had won, he answered “Nothing,” meaning, “insight into 
the nothingness of things.” But they did not understand, and therefore neglected 
to pay him the customary honours at his cremation. When the chief disciple 
returned and heard of this, he tried to explain matters to them, but they would 
not hearken until the Bodhisatta himself appeared from the Brahmaworld and 
convinced them of their folly. “Far better than a thousand fools,” he said, “is 
one who, hearing, understands.” </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to Sāriputta’s great 
wisdom. He is identified with the chief disciple (J.i.406ff). See also 
Sarabhanga Jātaka.</p>
