  <h2>Alasandā</h2>

</ul>
<p>A city in the land of the Yonas. There 
was a large Buddhist community there and it is said, in the Mahāvamsa (xxix.40), 
that on the occasion of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa by Dutthagāmani, the 
thera Yonaka Mahā Dhammarakkhita came to Anurādhapura from Alasanda with 30,000 
monks.</p>
<p>In the Milindapañha (p.327) Alasandā is 
mentioned in a list of places, among which are China, 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and Gandhāra. 
 
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the same book (82,83), King Milinda is mentioned as saying that he 
was born in a village named Kalasi in Alasandā, but he speaks of Alasandā as an 
island. It was about two hundred leagues from Sāgala.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted (E.g., in 
Questions of King Milinda, i., p.xxiii, see also CHI., p.550) that Alasandā was 
the name of an island in the Indus in the territory of Baktria. Geiger 
(Mhv.trs.194, n.3) thinks that it is probably to be identified with the town 
founded by the Macedonian king in the country of Paropanisadae near Kabul.</p>
<p>In the Apadāna (i.359) the Alasandakā 
are mentioned in a list of tribes.</p>
