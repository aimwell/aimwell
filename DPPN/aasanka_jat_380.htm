<p>Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic in 
the Himālaya. At that time a being of great merit left Tāvatimsa and was born as 
a girl in the midst of a lotus in a pool near the Bodhisatta’s hermitage. The 
Bodhisatta, noticing some peculiarity in the growth of the lotus, swam to it and 
recovered the girl, whom he brought up as his daughter, giving her the name of 
Āsankā. Sakka, coming to visit him, saw the girl, and, inquiring what he could 
do for her comfort, he provided her with a crystal palace and divine food and 
raiment. She spent her time waiting on the Bodhisatta. The King of 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, 
having heard of her great beauty, came to the forest with a large following and 
asked for her hand. The Bodhisatta agreed, on condition that the king would tell 
him her name. The king spent a whole year trying to guess it and, having failed, 
was returning home in despair, when the girl, looking out of her window, told 
him of the creeper Āsāvatī, for whose fruits gods wait for one thousand years. 
She thus encouraged him to try again. Another year passed and she again raised 
hopes in the disappointed king by relating to him the story of a crane whose 
hopes Sakka had fulfilled. At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by 
his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, 
and in the course of their talk the girl’s name was mentioned. When the king was 
told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and 
told it to him. The Bodhisatta then gave Āsankā in marriage to the king 
(J.iii.248-54). See also the Indriya Jātaka..</p>
