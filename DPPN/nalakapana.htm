<h4>Nalakapāna</h4>
<p>A village in Kosala, where the Buddha once stayed and 
preached the Nalakapāna Sutta (M.i.462). The village received its name from the 
Nalakapāna pokkharani (MA.ii.66 4f.; AA.ii.813). The reason for the name of this 
pond, which was in the village, is given in the Nalapāna Jataka. There were two 
groves near the village, the Ketakavana and the Palāsavana; in the latter, 
Sāriputta preached two sermons at the request of the Buddha. A.v.122f., 125 f.</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Nalakapāna Sutta</h4>
<p>Preached at the Palāsavana in Nalakapāna. The Buddha asks 
the assembled monks&nbsp;&nbsp; among whom are many distinguished members, such 
as Anuruddha, Kimbīla, Nandiya and others — if they feel they have realized the 
aim for which they have given up household life? On their assenting, he proceeds 
to tell them that when he claims that he has destroyed the āsavas and that his 
disciples have gained various attainments through his teaching, he does so, not 
in order to cajole or to delude others, nor to gain fame and profit for himself, 
but to hearten and fill with enthusiasm believing young men, that they may 
concentrate with their whole hearts and follow the example of his disciples. 
M.i.462ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nalakapāna Sutta</h4>
<p>The Buddha, having preached to the monks in Palāsavana in 
Nalakapāna till late at night, asks Sāriputta to continue, as he has pain in his 
back and wishes to rest. Sāriputta thereupon takes up the sermon and tells the 
monks of the necessity for saddhā, hiri, ottappa, viriya and paññā, for the 
performance of good works. The Buddha returns and praises Sāriputta. A.v.122ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nalakapāna Sutta</h4>
<p>The circumstances are the same as in (2), but the 
qualities mentioned by Sāriputta differ — 
saddhā, hiri, ottappa, viriya, sotāvadhāna, dhammadhāranā, atthupaparikkhā, 
dhammānudhammapatipatti, and appamāda. A.v.125ff.</p>
