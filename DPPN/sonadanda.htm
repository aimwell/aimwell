  <h2>Sonadanda</h2>

</ul>
<p>A rich brahmin of Campā, very learned in the Vedas; he 
lived in a royal domain, given to him as royal fief by King Bimbisāra. When the 
Buddha was in Campā, on the banks of the Gaggarā-lake, Sonadanda visited him in 
spite of the protests of his friends and colleagues. Their conversation is 
recorded in the Sonadanda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Sonadanda 
expressed his appreciation of the Buddha and his doctrine, and invited him and 
his monks to a meal. At the conclusion of the meal Sonadanda asked the Buddha to 
forgive him if, in the presence of the brahmins, he did not make humble 
obeisance to the Buddha, but merely saluted him. Buddhaghosa explains 
(D.i.111ff., DA.i.292ff ) that this was because Sonadanda was much older than 
the Buddha and did not wish people to see him paying homage to one young enough 
to be his grandson. But, probably, Sonadanda’s conversion to the faith was only 
partial. </p>
<p>Angaka (q.v.) was Sonadanda’s sister’s son.</p>
