<p><b>1. Sundara. </b>A city where Kassapa Buddha performed 
the Yamaka-pātihāriya at the foot of an asana tree (BuA.218), and Konāgamana 
Buddha under a mahāsāla-tree (BuA.214).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sundara.</b> A monk of Rājagaha. One day, as he 
walked through the street, a woman asked him to stop for a moment that she might 
worship him, and, raising the end of his robe, took his penis into her mouth. A 
doubt arose in his mind as to whether any blame attached to him and he consulted 
the Buddha, who said that as Sundara had not acquiesced in the act, he was 
blameless. Vin.iii.36; of the story of St. Anthony.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sundara. </b>A monk who, with five hundred others of 
the same name, was present at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa. MT.522.</p>
