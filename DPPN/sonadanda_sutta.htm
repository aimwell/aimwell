  <h2>Sonadanda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya. It records the 
discussion between the Buddha and Sonadanda. The Buddha asks him what things 
enable a man to make a just claim to be a brahmin and Sonadanda answers him. The 
Buddha makes him admit that birth is of no importance, only the good life 
matters. The Buddha then teaches him what is meant by the good life in the 
Buddha’s own doctrine, in very much the same way as in that of the Sāmaññaphala 
Sutta. D.i.111ff.</p>
