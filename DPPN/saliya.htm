  <h2>Sāli, Sāliya</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Only son of Dutthagāmanī. He renounced the throne and 
married Asokamālā, a Candāla girl (Mv.xxxiii.1f). In his previous birth he had 
been a smith, named Tissa, in Mundagangā, and his wife was Nāgā (Sumanā). The 
couple gave a meal with pork to eight arahants, (for their names see MT.606) led 
by Dhammadinna Thera of Talangatissapabbata. It is said that on the day of birth 
the whole of Ceylon was filled with paddy, hence his name. </p>
<p>Sāli was very pious, and all the revenues given to him by 
his father he gave away in charity. He kept the fast days in the Issarasamana-vihāra 
and built the Sālipabbata vihāra (MT.606). </p>
<p>He will be the son of Metteyya Buddha in his next birth. 
MT.xxxii.83.
