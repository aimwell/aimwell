<p>1. Anomā.-A river thirty leagues to the 
east of Kapilavatthu, where Gotama went after leaving home. According to the 
Lalita Vistara, the river was only six yojanas from the city, and Cunningham 
accepts this (p. 
<st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="485 ff">485 ff</st1:frenchfranctoeuro>). 
It was eight usabhas in breadth, but</p>
<p>Kanthaka cleared it in one leap. It was 
here that Gotama cut off his hair and beard and put on the orange garments of 
the ascetics, brought to him by the Brahmā Ghatikāra.</p>
<p>On its banks was the mango grove of 
Anupiya (J.i.64f.; SnA.382). Three kingdoms lay between it and Kapilavatthu. 
(BuA.5. The countries of the Sākiyans, Koliyans and Mallas; see Expositor 
i.43n., where Kapilavatthu, Devadaha and Koliya are mentioned as the three 
kingdoms).</p>
<p>From the river to Rājagaha was a 
distance of thirty leagues, which Gotama took seven days to walk (J.i.65; 
SnA.382). It took him a whole night to ride from Kapilavatthu to Anomā 
(VvA.314).</p>
<p>The name seems to have meant “Glorious,” 
or “not Slight“. See J.i.64, where Gotama asks Channa the name of the river and 
Channa replies “It is Anoma (glorious).” “Good,” says Gotama, “my renunciation 
shall also be anomā.” The Burmese name is Anauma (Bigandet. p.41).</p>
<p>Cunningham (*) identifies the river with 
the modern Aumi. He states his belief that the word means “inferior,” to 
distinguish it from other and larger rivers in the neighbourhood, and that the 
original name in Pali was Omā. According to him the confusion in names arose 
from a misunderstanding of Channa’s reply. It is difficult to accept this 
suggestion because evidently, according to the tradition quoted in the Jātaka 
commentary and elsewhere, the name of the river was taken as a good augury for 
the accomplishment of Gotama’s desires.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*) p.486ff.; in the Sutta Nipāta (vv. 
  153, 177) and again in the Samyutta (i. 33) the Buddha is spoken of as 
  Anomanāma. Buddhaghosa (SA.i.67) explains this as meaning having no “defect,” 
  endowed with perfection (sabbagunasamannāgatattā avekalla-nāmam; paripūranāmam).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas (Loc cit., p. 61 and n.1), on the 
other hand, suggests that Anomā did not necessarily really exist. There was 
possibly an actual locality to the east of Kapilavatthu traditionally associated 
with Gotama’s flight. It was probably near Anupiya of the Malla country, and the 
names given to it, such as Anomā, Anomiya, Anuvaniya, Anumaniya, were 
corruptions of Anupiya in the popular dialects of the neighbourhood. </p>
<p>The Mahāvastu does not mention a river; 
it only mentions a town, Anomiya, twelve leagues from Kapilavatthu. The names 
Anuvaineya and Maneya occur in the Lalitavistara.</p>
