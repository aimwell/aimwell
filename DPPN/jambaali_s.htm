<p>Some monks attain to release of mind, 
but when they apply themselves to the ending of sakkāya their minds do not 
settle down, do not stay fixed; they are like a man who grasps a branch with his 
hand smeared with resin. In the case of other monks, their minds abide in the 
release attained and stay fixed in the endeavour to destroy sakkāya — and they 
are like a man who grasps a branch with a clean hand. Some monks strive to 
destroy ignorance but are unsuccessful. Their minds are like a village pond (jambālī) 
which has stood for countless years with all its inlets blocked and outlets open 
and receiving no rain. There will be no breach in its dyke. There are other 
monks who break through ignorance by application of the mind — like a village 
pond with all its inlets open and outlets closed and with rain falling 
continuously into it. A.ii.165f.</p>
