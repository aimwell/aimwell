  <h2>Manāpadāyi Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ugga, a householder of Vesāli, having heard from the 
Buddha that the giver of good things (manāpadāyī) gains the good, invites the 
Buddha to his house and gives him various things which he himself is very fond 
of gruel from sal flowers, flesh of pigs with jujube-fruit, oily tube like 
vegetables, rice with curries and condiments, muslin from Benares and a 
sandalwood plank (in place of a luxurious couch, which, Ugga knew, the Buddha 
could not accept). Out of compassion for Ugga, the Buddha accepted these gifts 
and blessed him. Later, Ugga died and was reborn in a mind born world (manomayakāya). 
He visited the Buddha at Jetavana and told him that his hopes had been realized.
