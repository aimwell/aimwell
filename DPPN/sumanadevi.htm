<p><b>1. Sumanadevī. </b>Mother of 
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa Thera</a>. 
Ap.ii.583.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sumanadevī.</b> Mother of Suppatitthita. MT. 528.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sumanadevī.</b> Step sister of Khallātanāga. She had 
three sons — Tissa, Abhaya and Uttara who conspired against the king. On the 
failure of their conspiracy, they jumped into the fire on the spot where now 
stands the Abhayagiri-cetiya. MT. 612.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sumanadevī. </b>Youngest daughter of Anāthapindika. 
When her sisters, Mahāsubhaddā and Cullasubhaddā, married and went to live with 
their husbands, Anāthapindika appointed her to look after the feeding of the 
monks in his house. She became a sakadāgāmi and remained unmarried. Because of 
her failure to obtain a husband, she refused to eat, and fell ill. One day, when 
Anāthapindika was in the refectory, he received a message from her. He went 
immediately and asked her what was the matter. She addressed him as “Younger 
brother,” and saying that she had no fear, she died. Anāthapindika, in great 
sorrow, sought the Buddha and confessed his grief that she should have died 
while talking incoherently. The Buddha explained that, inasmuch as she was a 
sakadāgāmī and he but a sotāpanna, her addressing him as “Younger brother” was 
quite in order. After death she was born in Tusita, said the Buddha. DhA.i.151f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sumanadevī.</b> Mother of Visākhā. Her husband was 
Dhanañjaya, son of Mendakasetthi of Bhaddīya-nagara (DhA.i.384f.; SA.i.116, 
etc.). She was one of the Mahāpuññā. Vsm.383; PSA.509, etc.</p>
