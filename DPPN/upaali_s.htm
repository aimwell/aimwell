<p><b>1. Upāli Sutta.</b>-Records the events that 
lead to the conversation of <a href="upaali.htm#Gahapati" title="u/upaali.htm#Gahapati">Upāli-Gahapati</a>. The Buddha is asked, first by 
<a href="diighatapassii.htm" title="d/diighatapassii.htm">Dīgha-Tapassī</a> and then by Upāli, as to which of the three kinds of deeds — of 
body, speech and mind — are the most criminal. Those of mind, says the Buddha; 
those of body, say the followers of Nātaputta. By various illustrations the 
Buddha convinces Upāli that his contentions are wrong. The sutta concludes with 
a series of verses (the Upāli Gāthā) in which Upāli sings the Buddha’s praises. 
M.i.371ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Upāli Sutta.</b>-Upāli Thera visits the 
Buddha and asks him for what purpose the various precepts have been laid down 
for disciples and why the <a href="patimokkha.htm" title="pa/patimokkha.htm">pātimokkha</a> has been recited? For ten purposes, says 
the Buddha, and proceeds to enumerate them. Similarly, ten reasons are given 
which justify the suspension of the pātimokkha. A.v.70f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Upāli Sutta.</b>-Upāli (1) visits the 
Buddha and expresses a desire to retire to the solitude of the forest. Such a 
step is not desirable for those who have not attained to tranquillity of mind, 
says the Buddha, and explains his meaning by various similes. A full-grown 
elephant could disport himself in a deep lake according to his fancy, not so a 
hare or a cat. The sutta goes on to describe how, as a result of the arising of 
a Tathāgata in the world, a householder would listen to the Dhamma, renounce the 
world, give up all evil practices and gradually attain to full development of 
the four jhānas. Upāli is advised to live among the monks and not go into the 
forest. A.v.201ff.</p>
