<p>A woodland in Veluvana. Here food (nivāpa) 
was regularly placed for the squirrels. It is said that once a certain raja went 
there for a picnic and, having over-drunk, fell asleep. His retinue, seeing him 
sleeping, wandered away, looking for flowers and fruits. A snake, attracted by 
the smell of liquor, approached the king from a neighbouring tree-trunk, and 
would have bitten him had not a tree-sprite, assuming the form of a squirrel, 
awakened him by her chirping. In gratitude the rājā gave orders that thenceforth 
the squirrels in that locality should be fed regularly. UdA.60; SnA.ii.419. 
According to some, it was the gift of a merchant named Kalandaka (Beal: Romantic 
Legend, p.315); Tibetan sources identify the rājā with Bimbisāra and say that 
the snake was a reincarnation of the owner whose land the king had confiscated. 
According to these same sources the name is Kalantaka and is described as the 
name of a bird (Rockhill: op. cit., p.43).</p>
<p>Kalandakanivāpa was evidently a 
favourite resort of the Buddha and his monks.</p>
