  <h2>Makkata Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>In certain tracts of the Himālaya where monkeys resort, 
hunters set up traps of pitch to catch the monkeys. Wise monkeys avoid the 
traps, but the foolish ones handle the pitch and their paws stick in it, one 
after another, and finally their muzzles, in their struggles to escape. So it is 
with foolish men who allow their senses to roam in wrong pastures — 
the objects of the senses. S.v.148.</p>
