  <h2>Bālakalonakārāma, Bākalonakārāgama</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A locality near <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. </p>
<p>When the monks of Kosambī started quarrelling, the Buddha 
left them and went to Bālakalonakārāma, where he visited <a href="bhagu_th.htm" title="b/bhagu_th.htm">Bhagu</a> and preached to 
him on the virtues of solitude. From there the Buddha proceeded to 
<a href="pacinavamsamigadaya.htm" title="pa/pacinavamsamigadaya.htm">Pācīnavamsadāya</a> (Vin.i.350; M.iii.154; DhA.i.47; J.iii.489). </p>
<p>The readings of the texts are uncertain, and it is 
impossible to say whether a village (gāma) is meant or only a grove (ārāma).  </p>
<p>The 
reading Bālakalonakāragāma occurs in the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.596); but 
even here two explanations are given: one to the effect that Bālaka was the name 
of a village of salt makers (? lonakāragāma) belonging to Upāli phapati. When 
the inhabitants of the village came to Upāli with their taxes, he went with them 
(bālakagāmavāsiniyā . . . parisāya) to see Nigantha Nātaputta.  </p>
<p>The other 
explanation is that the word bālakiniyā in the text is an adjective meaning 
“composed of fools” (bālavatiyā bālussannāya) (Cp.,J.i.246, where mention is 
made of bālagāmikamanussā who were obviously fools). The confusion seems, 
therefore, to have arisen very early. Upāli’s village (of Bāka), if such a place 
existed, was probably near Nālandā.</p>
