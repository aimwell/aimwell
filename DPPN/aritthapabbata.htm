<p>A mountain in Ceylon half-way between 
Anurādhapura and Pulatthipuva. It is identified with modern Ritigala, and is 
near the modern Habarane in the North-Central Province (Mhv.trans.72, n.3). 
Pandukābhaya lived there for seven years, awaiting an opportunity to make war on 
his uncles, and it was near there that he ultimately defeated them 
(Mhv.x.63-72). At the foot of the mountain, Sūratissa built the Makulaka Vihāra 
(Mhv.xxi.6). Lañjatissa built a vihāra on the mountain and called it Arittha 
Vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.27).</p>
<p>Jetthatissa occupied the mountain before 
his fight with Aggabodhi III., and it was there that he organised his forces 
(Cv.xliv.86).</p>
<p>Sena I. built a monastery on the 
mountain for the use of the Pamsukulikas and endowed it with large revenues 
(Cv.l.63).</p>
<p>At the present day the place is 
extremely rich in ruins. See Hocart: Memoirs of the Arch. Survey of Ceylon i.44.</p>
