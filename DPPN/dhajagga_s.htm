  <h2>Dhajagga Sutta</h2>

<p>Relates the story of how, when Sakka led 
his forces into battle, he told them that should any panic arise in their heart, 
they should look at the crest of his banner and their fears would immediately 
vanish. Or they should look at the banners of Pajāpatī or Varuna or Isāna. 
Similarly should any fear arise in the mind of a monk he should recall to mind 
the excellences of the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sangha, and peace would 
come to him (S.i.218f).</p>
<p>This sutta is also included among the 
Parittas and is called the Dhajagga Paritta (E.g., Mil.150).</p>
<p>It is said that once a sāmanera, helping 
to plaster the Dīghavāpi cetiya, fell from the top. His colleagues shouted to 
him to recall the Dhajagga Paritta. He did so, and was miraculously saved. 
SA.i.262f.</p>
