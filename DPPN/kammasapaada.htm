<p>The name given to the porisāda 
(cannibal) in the <a href="mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm" title="maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537.htm">Mahāsutasoma Jātaka</a>. Before becoming man-eater he was 
the king of Benares, and was later weaned from his evil habit by the Bodhisatta Sutasoma. He is identified with 
<a href="angulimaala.htm" title="ay/angulimaala.htm">Angulimāla</a> (J.v.pp.503f, 511).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (DA.ii.483) explains the 
name (“Spot=foot”) as being given because of a wound he once received, which 
healed, leaving a scar like a piece of well-grained timber (cittadārusadiso). 
This refers to the flight of the porisāda from his pursuers, when he trod on an 
acacia stake (khānu) which pierced his foot (J.v.472).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa, the cannibal 
in the <a href="jayaddisa_jat_513.htm" title="j/jayaddisa_jat_513.htm">Jayaddisa Jātaka</a> was also called Kammāsa or Kammāsapāda. (DA.ii.483. See 
also Watanabe’s article, “The Story of Kalmāsapāda and its Evolution in Indian 
Literature.” J.P.T.S.1909, pp.236ff).</p>
<p>The place where the porisāda was tamed 
was called <a href="kammaasadamma.htm" title="ka/kammaasadamma.htm">Kammāsadamma</a>.</p>
