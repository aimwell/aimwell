  <h2>Canndakālī</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A nun, well known for her quarrelsome 
propensities. She was a friend of Thullanandā, during whose absence the other 
nuns once expelled Canndakālī from their midst. This act was greatly resented by 
Thullanandā and Canndakālī was readmitted (Vin.iv.230). </p>
<p>She is several times mentioned as 
starting quarrels with other nuns, and when they disagreed with her she 
threatened to denounce the Buddha and the nuns and to join some other Order, 
declaring that there were other Orders which were, in every way, as good as the 
Buddha’s. Once, when some of her colleagues asked her if she had seen something 
lost by them, she cursed them roundly and started to weep and create a scene 
(Vin.iv.276, 277). </p>
<p>She was charged with frequenting 
gatherings of laymen (Vin.iv.293, 309), and it is said (Vin.iv.333) that she 
joined Thullanandā in various vicious practices. She once applied for permission 
to ordain nuns (vutthāpanasammuti) but was refused, and on discovering that 
other nuns had obtained this permission she became violently abusive 
(Vin.iv.331).</p>
