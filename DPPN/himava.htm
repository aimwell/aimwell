  <h2>Himavā, Himācala, Himavanta, etc. </h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the Himālaya. It is one of the seven 
mountain ranges surrounding Gandhamādana (SNA.i.66).</p>
<p>It is three hundred thousand leagues in extent 
(SNA.i.224), with eighty four thousand peaks its 
highest peak being five hundred yojanas (SNA.ii.443) In Himavā, are seven great 
lakes, each fifty leagues in length, breadth and depth — Anotatta, Kannamunda, 
Rathakāra, Chaddanta, Kunāla, Mandākinī and Sīhappapātaka; these lakes are never 
heated by the sun (A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; cf. AA.ii.759). From Himavā flow five 
hundred rivers. SNA.ii.437; but according to Mil.114, only ten of these are to 
be reckoned, the others flowing only intermittently. These ten are:&nbsp; Gangā, 
Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, Mahī, Sindhu, Sarassatī, Vettavatī, Vītamsā and 
Candabhāgā.</p>
<p>In numerous Jātakas Himavā is mentioned as the place to 
which ascetics retire when they leave household life. It is full of woodlands 
and groves, suitable for hermits (E.g., SA.i.265). In Himavā is a peak named 
Mahāpapāta where Pacceka Buddhas die (SNA.i.129). Nāgas go to Himavā to give 
birth to their young (SA.iii.120; cf. S.v.63). The mountain is often used in 
similes; it is then referred to as pabbatarājā (E.g., S.ii.137; v.464; 
A.iii.311; M.iii.166, etc.). Sīvalī Thera once went there from Sāvatthi with 
five hundred others. The journey took them eight days. (Details are given at 
ThagA.ii.138; PSA.252).</p>
<p>The country round Himavā was converted by Majjhima Thera 
(Mhv.xii.41). He was accompanied by four others: Kassapagotta, Mūladeva (Alakadeva), 
Sahadeva and Dundubhissara (Dpv.viii.10; MT.317). Majjhima preached the 
Damma-cakka-ppavattana Sutta and eighty crores attained salvation. These five 
Theras converted five kingdoms and each ordained one hundred thousand persons 
(Mhv.xii.42f).</p>
<p>Devas brought for Asoka’s use, from the Himālaya, twigs of 
the nāgalatā to clean his teeth, healthful fruits, myrobalan, teminalia and 
mango fruit (Mhv.v.25f), while, for the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa, sāmaneras 
with iddhi-power brought sweet scented marumba (Mhv.xxix.9).</p>
<p>The Kunāla Jātaka (q.v.) was preached in the region of 
Himavā. The Buddha took the Sākyan princes there and showed them the various 
features, including many mountain peaks, such as: Manipabbata, Hingulapabbata, 
Añjanapabbata, Sānupabbata, and Phalikapabbata (J.v.415). </p>
<p>On fast days the gods assemble in Himavā and hold 
discourses. Sp.iv.759.</p>
