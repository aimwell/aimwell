  <h2>Mānava Thera</h2>

<p>He belonged to a rich brahmin family of Sāvatthi. When on 
his way to the park one day, at the age of seven, he saw, for the first time, 
persons afflicted with old age, disease, and death. These filled him with 
horror, and he went to the monastery, heard the Buddha preach, and, with his 
parents' consent, entered the Order. He was called “Mānava” because he left the 
world so young.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a physiognomist, and, 
having seen the child, declared that he would certainly become a Buddha, and 
worshipped him. In subsequent lives he became king many times under the names of 
Sammukhāthavika, Pathavīdundubhi, Obhāsa, Sadinacchedana, Agginibbāpaka, Vātamma, 
Gatipacchedana, Ratanapajjala, Padakkamana, Vilokana and Girisāra (ThagA.vs.73; 
ThagA.i.162ff).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Sammukhāthavika Thera of 
the Apadāna. Ap.i.158f.</p>
