  <h2>Rajata Rajatalena (Rajatamaya) vihāra</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A monastery in Ceylon, built by Ānanda gāmanī Abhaya (Mhv.xxxv.4; but see 
Cv.c.238, where Dutthagāmanī is stated to have built it). It was in 
Ambatthakolalena, where silver was discovered for use in the construction of the 
Mahā Thūpa (Mhv. Trs.188, n.1). Kittisirirājasīha (Cv.xcix.41) visited the 
vihāra and paid it great honour and gave it to a sāmanera called Siddhattha 
(Cv.c.238). The vihāra is now called Ridī vihāra and is near the modern 
Kurunegala.</p>
