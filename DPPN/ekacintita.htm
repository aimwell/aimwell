<p><b>2. Ekacintita Thera.</b>-An arahant. When in 
the deva-world, his term of life having come to an end, he was filled with 
anxiety as to where he should seek rebirth. A disciple of Padumuttara, named Sumana, seeing his plight, advised him to seek refuge in the Buddha. He followed 
the advice and escaped sorrow. Ap.i.194f.</p>
