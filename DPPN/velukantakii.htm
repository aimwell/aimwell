<p>A lady of Velukanta (Velukanda). She is mentioned as an 
exemplary lay woman (A.i.88; ii.164). She founded, for the Order headed by 
Sāriputta and Moggallāna an offering which the Buddha praised, because it was 
endowed with the six requisite qualities. See Dāna Sutta (1).</p>
<p>Once she rose before dawn and sang the Parāyana. Vessavana 
happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south (to see the 
Buddha, says SNA.i.369), and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise 
it and to reveal his identity. She greeted him cordially, and in return for her 
greeting he announced to her that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were on their way to 
Velukanta. She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to 
the monastery, inviting the monks to the house. After the meal, she informed the 
Elders that Vessavana had told her of their arrival. When they expressed their 
amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her. Her only son 
Nanda was seized by the king’s men and killed before her eyes, but she 
experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having 
been born as a Yakkha (Bhummadevatā says the Commentary), revealed himself to 
her. She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the 
four jhānas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters. The monks 
expressed their great admiration and Sāriputta preached to her (A.iv.63ff).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.718; cf. SNA.i.370) that she was 
an anāgāmī, and that, when she promised to share with Vessavana the merits she 
would gain by entertaining the monks, headed by the two Chief Disciples, 
Vessavana, to show his gratitude, filled her stores with rice, and these stores 
remained always full throughout her life. They thus became proverbial.</p>
<p>The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.370) states that she 
kept a daily fast and knew the Pitakas by heart. It also says that, at the end 
of her recital of the Parāyana, Vessavana offered her a boon, and she asked 
that, as her servants were weary of carrying the harvest home from the fields, 
Vessavana should allow his Yakkhas to do the work for them. To this he agreed, 
and his followers filled for her one thousand two hundred and fifty store 
houses. Vessavana then went to the Buddha and told him of what had happened.</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.340) mentions Velukantakī 
Nandamātā and Khujjattarā as the chief lay women disciples of the Buddha. But in 
the Anguttara list' of eminent lay women, while Velukantakī Nandamātā’s name 
does not occur, Khujjatarā is mentioned. Mention is made of a Nandamātā, eminent 
in meditation, but she is called Uttarā.</p>
<p>A.i.26; cf. S.ii.236, where the same two are mentioned; 
Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks that Velukantakī Nandamātā is probably identical with 
Uttarā Nandamātā (Brethren 4, n.1). This identification does not seem to be 
correct. See Uttarā Nandamātā; see also Nanda-Kumāputta.</p>
