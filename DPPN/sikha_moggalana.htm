<p>A brahmin who once visited the Buddha, saying that he had 
been told by Sonakāyana that the Buddha preached the ineffectiveness of all 
deeds and asking if this were true. A.ii.232.</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (AA.ii.578; cf. Moliya ) that he 
was a brahmin of the Moggallānagotta and wore a large tuft (sikhā) on the crown 
of his head, hence his name.</p>
