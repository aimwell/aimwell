<hr>
<p><b>1. Gotama Thera.</b>-He belonged to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and was initiated at the age of seven. When he was seventeen, he fell into bad company, gave all he had to a courtesan and broke his vow of celibacy. He was then filled with remorse at the thought of what he had done, but the Buddha appeared before 
him and he entered the Order, becoming an arahant in the tonsure-hall.</p>
<p>He had been a householder in the time of Vipassī Buddha and had given to the 
Buddha an āmoda-fruit (Thag.137f.; ThagA.i.256f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with <a href="../am/amoraphaliya_th.htm">
Amodaphaliya</a> of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.447.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Gotama Thera.</b> He belonged to the Sākiyan clan and came to be known 
only by his gotta-name. He entered the Order when the Buddha visited his 
kinsfolk and, in due course, became an arahant. In the time of Sikhī Buddha he 
had offered eight campaka-flowers at the Buddha's thūpa (Thag.258-60; 
ThagA.i.374f). He is evidently identical with Citapūjaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.ii.407.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Gotama Thera</b>.-Also called Aparagotama. He was older than the Buddha 
and belonged to an Udicca-brahmin family of Sāvatthi. He was learned in the 
Vedas and was an unrivalled orator. When the Buddha came to Sāvatthi for the 
dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and entered the Order, 
attaining arahantship in the tonsure-hall. When he returned to Sāvatthi, after a 
long residence in the Kosala country, many of his relations, eminent brahmins, 
came to him and counselled him as to the various gospels (suddhivādā) current 
among the people; he told them of the Buddha's teaching. Thag.587-96; 
ThagA.i.529f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Gotama Thera.</b>-An arahant, living in Piyangudīpa. He was the teacher 
of Dutthagāmani (Mhv.xx.69). When the latter, during his flight from his 
brother, wished to give alms to a monk before eating, Gotama knew his desire and 
sent a monk named Tissa to accept the alms. When the food was brought to 
Piyangudīpa, Gotama offered morsels of it to five hundred monks (twelve 
thousand, according to Mhv.xxxii.65) and, refilling the bowl with scraps of 
food, sent it back by air to the prince (Mhv.xxiv.24, 30; MT.465).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Gotama.</b>-The name of the clan to which the Buddha and the Sākiyans 
belonged. The members of the clan, though khattiyas, claimed descent from a 
brahmin isi, Gotama (For an explanation of this see Thomas, op. cit., 22f). 
Gotama and Angiras are both enumerated in the Pravara ceremony as the ancestors 
of the Gotama clan (Asvalāyana, Srauta-sūtra, 12, 11, 1).</p>
<p>Late Buddhists appear to have forgotten the Vedic rsi, for, according to an 
ancient legend, Okkāka, the immediate ancestor of the Sākiyans, was born of an 
egg formed of the coagulated blood and semen of an ascetic Gotama, as he lay 
impaled for the alleged murder of a courtesan. The egg was hatched by the sun 
(Mtu.i.338ff; Rockhill, Buddha, 9f).</p>
<p>Gotama is the name by which the Buddha is addressed by brahmins and others 
who are not his followers. In one place, at least, the Buddha is represented as 
addressing the Sākiyans as “Gotamā.” (S.iv.183). The Gotama-gotta is classed 
among the higher gottas, together with such gottas as Moggallāna, Kaccāyana and 
Vāsettha (Vin.iv.6; DA.i.246f, uccākula-paridīpanam). According to the 
Theragāthā Commentary (ii.204; also AA.i.395; Gotama-buddhassa sāvako pi Gotamo), 
the Buddha's disciples (e.g., in the case of Vangisa) were also called Gotama, 
even when they did not naturally belong to that clan. See also Sakyā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Gotama.</b>-A brahmin sage, his full name being Angirasa Gotama. See 
Angirasa (7).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Gotama.</b>-The name of the brahmin chaplain in the Bhikkhāparampara 
Jātaka. The scholiast adds that it was his gotta-name (J.iv.371, 372).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Gotama.</b>-A mountain near Himavā (Ap.i.162).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Gotama.</b>-A thera in Ceylon who wrote a Sinhalese paraphrase to the 
Sambandhacintā. He belonged to the Araññavāsī sect and was a pupil of Vanaratana 
Ananda (P.L.C.199, 220).</p>
