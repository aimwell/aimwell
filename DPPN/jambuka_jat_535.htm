<p>A jackal, seeing a lion, expressed his 
wish to be his servant. The lion agreed and provided him with food. On growing 
strong, the jackal offered to kill an elephant and, in spite of the lion’s 
warnings, was trampled to death. The lion was the Bodhisatta and the jackal 
Devadatta.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempt to imitate the Buddha. J.iii.112ff.</p>
