  <h2>Khajjanīya Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The well-taught Ariyan disciple, 
remembering his past lives, realises how, in the past, he has been a prey to the 
body, feelings, perception, activities and consciousness; how he is still their 
prey, and will be so in the future, too, if he be enamoured of them. Thus 
realising, he conceives disgust for the body, etc., is repelled by them, and 
obtains release from them. He thereby attains freedom and becomes aware that he 
is free. S.iii.86-91; this sutta is wrongly titled Sīha in the Samyutta text; 
see KS.iii.72, n.3.</p>
<p>The sutta was also preached by Mahinda 
in the Nandana grove on the fifth day of his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xv.195).</p>
<p>In the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.32) 
the sutta is referred to as the Khajja-nīyapariyāya.</p>
