  <h2>Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhināpatha)</h2>

<p>In the old Pāli literature the name 
Dakkhināpatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the 
banks of the upper Godāvarī. Thus, we are told that Bāvarī had his hermitage in 
Dakkhināpatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., 
vs.976). Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhināpatha and 
seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. Vin.i.195, 196; 
ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhinūpathe 
Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhināpatha is spoken of.</p>
<p>The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (ii.580) 
seems to explain Dakkhināpatha as the road leading to the <b>Dakkhinajanapada</b>, 
while the Sumangala-Vilāsinī (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhināpatha to be synonymous 
with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the 
Ganges (Gangāya dakkhinato pākatajanapadam).</p>
<p>It is clear that, in the earlier 
literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the 
modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhināpatha was originally the name 
of the road which led southwards — the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, 
on the banks of the Godāvarī being also called by the same name — and that later 
the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a 
detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the 
Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is 
included in the Dakkhināpatha.  </p>
<p>The Dakkhināpatha is famous in literature as the 
birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.). It held 
also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the “southern districts” (Dakkhinesu 
janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216). See Dharana 
Sutta.</p>
