<hr>
<p><b>1. Sobhita. </b>&nbsp;The sixth of the twenty four 
Buddhas.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>He was born in the city of Sudhamma,  </li>
  <li>his father being the khattiya 
Sudhamma and his mother Sudhammā.  </li>
  <li>For nine thousand years he lived as a 
householder in three palaces — Kumuda, Nalira and Paduma —  </li>
  <li>his wife being Samangī (Makhilā according to the BuA.) and his son Sīha.  
  </li>
  <li>He entered the 
monastic life in the palace itself and there attained the four jhānas.</li>
  <li>His wife gave him a meal of milk rice.  </li>
  <li>After practising 
austerities for only seven days, he attained Enlightenment at the foot of a Naga 
tree in the palace garden, going there through the air with all his retinue.  
  </li>
  <li>He 
preached his first sermon to his step brothers, Asama and Sunetta — who later 
became his chief Disciples — in the Sudhamma pleasaunce.  </li>
  <li>Anuma was his constant 
attendant.  </li>
  <li>His chief disciples among nuns were Nakulā and Sujātā.  
  </li>
  <li>Ramma and 
Sudatta were his chief lay patrons among men and Nakulā and Cittā among women. 
 
</li>
  <li>His height was fifty eight hands.  </li>
  <li>He lived for ninety thousand years and died in 
the Sīhārāma.  </li>
  <li>The Bodhisatta was a brahmin named Sujāta. Bu.vii.1ff.; 
BuA.137ff.; Mhv.i.7, etc.</li>

<p><b>2. Sobhita.</b> The constant attendant of 
<a href="piyadassii.htm" title="pu/piyadassii.htm">Piyadassī</a> 
Buddha. Bu.xiv.20; J.i.34.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sobhita.</b> See <a href="sobhana.htm" title="s/sobhana.htm">Sobhana (3).</a></p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sobhita.</b> A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.71). Ninety 
four kappas ago he lived in Cittakūta, and Kanhadinna, in a previous birth, 
offered him punnāga-flowers (ThagA.i.304; cf. Ap.ii.416).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sobhita.</b> A mountain near 
<a href="himava.htm" title="h/himava.htm">Himavā</a>. Ap.i.328, 416.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sobhita.</b> A brahmin in the time of 
<a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> 
Buddha; a previous birth of Sāgata Thera. He uttered verses in praise of 
Padumuttara. Ap.i.83.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sobhita.</b> A tāpasa in the time of 
<a href="padumuttara.htm" title="pa/padumuttara.htm">Padumuttara</a> Buddha; he was a previous birth of Tissametteyya. Ap.ii.339.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Sobhita Thera.</b> He belonged to a brahmin family 
of Sāvatthi and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order, attaining 
arahantship. Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those who could 
remember past births (pubbenīvāsānussarantānam).  </p>
<p>He had resolved to win this 
eminence in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was a householder in Hamsavatī.</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a brahmin, expert in 
the Vedas. Later he left household life and lived in a hermitage near Himavā.</p>
<p>Having heard of the appearance of a Buddha in the world, 
he went to Bandhumatī with all possible speed and uttered the Buddha’s praises 
in six stanzas (A.i.25; Thag.vss.165, 166; AA.i.172; ThagA.i.288f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Ñanatthavika of the Apadāna 
(Ap.ii.421f). He was once accused of claiming to possess uttarimanussadhamma, 
but was exonerated by the Buddha (Vin.iii.109). He was evidently an exponent of 
the Abhidhamma (see DhSA., p.32).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Sobhita Thera.</b> An arahant (Ap.i.163). He is 
evidently identical with <a href="rakkhita.htm" title="r/rakkhita.htm">Rakkhita Thera</a>. ThagA.i.173.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Sobhita.</b> An ārāma in 
<a href="hamsavatii.htm" title="h/hamsavatii.htm">Hamsavatī</a>, on the banks of 
the river, and at the city gate. Padumuttara Buddha once lived there. Ap.ii.343.</p>
