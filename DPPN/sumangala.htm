<p><b>1. Sumangala.</b> Aggasāvaka of Dīpankara Buddha. 
J.i.29; Bu.ii.213.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sumangala.</b> One of the chief lay patrons of 
Kassapa Buddha (Bu.xxv.41; J.i.92).</p>
<p>He spread the ground with bricks of gold for a space of 
twenty usabhas and spent an equal sum on a monastery for the Buddha. . He saw a 
man sleeping,&nbsp; and thought to himself that the man must be a thief. The man 
conceived a grudge against Sumangala, and burned his fields seven times, cut the 
feet off the cattle in his pen seven times, and burned his house seven times. 
Then knowing that Sumangala loved the Buddha’s Gandhakuti, he also set fire to 
that. It was burnt down by the time Sumangala could arrive there; seeing it, he 
clasped his hands, saying that now he could build another in its place. Then the 
thief went about with a knife concealed on him, waiting to kill Sumangala. One 
day Sumangala held a great almsgiving, at the conclusion of which he said: “Sir, 
there is evidently an enemy of mine trying to do me harm. I have no anger 
against him, and will give over to him the fruits of this offering.” The thief 
heard and was filled with remorse, and begged his forgiveness. The thief was 
later born as a peta on Gijjhakuta. DhA.iii.61f.</p>

<p><b>7. Sumangala Thera. </b>He was born in a poor family in 
a hamlet near Sāvatthi. When he grew up, he earned his living in the fields. One 
day he saw Pasenadi hold a great almsgiving to the Order, and, seeing the food 
served to the monks, desired to enter the Order that he might lead a life of 
ease and luxury. A Thera to whom he confessed his desire ordained him, and sent 
him to the forest with an exercise for meditation. In solitude he pined and 
wavered, and finally returned to his village. As he went along he saw men 
working in the fields in the hot wind, with soiled garments, covered with dust. 
And thinking how miserable they were, he put forth fresh effort in his 
meditations, and, winning insight, attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the past he saw Siddhattha Buddha (? Atthadassī Buddha) 
standing in one robe, after a bath. Pleased with this sight, he clapped his 
hands. One hundred and sixteen kappas ago he was twice king, under the name of

eighteen kappas ago he was a brahmin. One day, having made preparations for a

his monks. Ap.i.65f.</p>
