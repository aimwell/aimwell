<p>The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant and had a herdsman 
to guard his cows in a forest shielding. They gave but little milk, through fear 
of a lion living in the forest. The merchant, knowing that the lion loved a doe, 
had her caught and her body rubbed with poison. When she returned to the forest, 
the lion licked her body and died.</p>
<p>The Buddha related this story to the monks to show them 
the necessity for circumspection in accepting gifts. J.i.387f.</p>
