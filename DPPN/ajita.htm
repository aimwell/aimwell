<p><b>6. Ajita</b>.-Thera (Ap.i.335ff), probably 
to be identified with Ajita (5), but the story of his past differs completely 
from that of Ajita-mānava given in the Thag. Commentary. In the time of the 
Buddha Padumuttara he lit a lamp in front of the Enlightened One. As a result of 
this he enjoyed happiness in heaven for 60,000 kappas, and when he was born from 
Tusita in this Buddha-age there was a great light on the day of his birth. He is 
stated to have been a disciple of Bāvarī (Ap.i.337, 28), but he heard of the 
Buddha while in Himavā. Later he became an arahant.</p>
