<p>A nun. She was present when 
Mahā-Kassapa, in the company of Ānanda, visited the nuns and preached to them. 
She expressed resentment that Kassapa should dare to preach in the presence of 
Ānanda. It was, she said, “as if the needle-pedlar should try to sell a needle 
to the needle-maker.” Ānanda afterwards asked Kassapa to ignore Tissā’s 
outburst, but she later left the Order. S.ii.215ff.</p>
