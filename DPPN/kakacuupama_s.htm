  <h2>Kakacūpama Sutta</h2>
  </li>

<p>The twenty-first sutta of the Majjhima 
Nikāya, preached to Moliya-Phagguna, who was reported to the Buddha for 
frequenting the society of nuns and losing his temper when reproached therefor. 
A monk should not give way to anger even though he be sawn limb from limb with a 
two-handed saw (ubhatodandakena kakacena). The name of the sutta was given by 
the Buddha himself (M.i.122ff).</p>
<p>The sutta contains the story of the lady 
of Sāvatthi, called Videhikā, who had a reputation for gentleness until tested 
by her servant girl and found wanting. The saw is only one of numerous similes 
which occur in the discourse. It is quoted in the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta 
(M.i.189), and is elsewhere (E.g., DA.i.123) given as an example of a sutta 
preached on account of someone’s lack of patience.</p>
