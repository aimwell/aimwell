<p>Wife of Kākavannatissa and mother of Dutthagāmanī and 
Saddhātissa. She was the daughter of Tissa, king of 
<a href="kalyaanii.htm" title="ka/kalyaanii.htm">Kalyānī</a> and was cast adrift 
in a boat on the ocean in order to appease the sea gods in their wrath against 
Tissa for having killed an arahant. Her name was Devī, but because she came 
ashore near the monastery of Tolaka (?) (This is probably the correct reading of 
the name; see MT. 432) she was called Vihāradevī (Mhv.xxii.20ff). When with her 
first child, she longed to eat a honeycomb one usabha in length and to drink the 
water in which had been washed the sword used in cutting off the head of 
Nandasārathī, chief of Elāra’s warriors (Mhv.42ff.; MT. 441). When she was the 
second time with child, she wished to lie under a campaka tree in bloom and 
inhale its fragrance (MT.443).</p>
<p>When her husband died, Saddhātissa carried her off, hoping 
thus to win the kingdom, but she was later restored to Dutthagāmanī. She was 
wise and practical and helped in Dutthagāmanī’s campaigns, especially in the 
capture of Ambatittha and Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxv.9, 55). We know nothing of her 
later history.</p>
