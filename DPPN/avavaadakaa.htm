<a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Nigantha</a> who had come to 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> to hold discussions and had there met a Niganthī

<a href="lola.htm" title="l/lola.htm">Lolā</a> and <a href="patacara.htm" title="pa/patacara.htm">Patācārā</a> and one 
brother <a href="saccaka.htm" title="sa/saccaka.htm">Saccaka</a>. The children learnt from their parents one thousand theses for

The story of their past is given in the
