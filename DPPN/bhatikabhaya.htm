  <h2>Bhātikābhaya</h2>

<p>Also called Bhātika or Bhātiya. Son of Kutakannatissa and 
king of Ceylon for twenty eight years (38 66 A.C.). He was called Bhātika or 
Bhātiya because he was the elder brother of Mahādāthika Mahānāga. He was very 
pious, and once had the whole of the Mahā Thūpa covered with sandalwood paste in 
which were embedded sweet smelling flowers. On another occasion he covered the 
whole thūpa with flowers and sprinkled them with water drawn by machines from 
the Abhaya-vāpi. He made a plaster covering for the 
Mahā Thūpa into which were mixed many, cartloads of pearls. A net of coral was 
made and thrown over the cetiya, and in its meshes were fastened lotus flowers 
of gold, as large as wagon wheels. One day the king heard the sound of the 
chanting of arahants in the relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa, and he lay down 
resolving not to rise until he had seen them. The theras made a door by which he 
could enter, and, having seen the glories of the chamber, he described them for 
the benefit of the people, making figures in illustration of his descriptions. 
Bhātikābhaya did many other works of merit, held Vesākha festivals, organized 
offerings for the Bodhi tree, and showed great hospitality to the monks at 
various places. He was succeeded by his brother Mahādāthika Mahānāga 
(Mhv.xxxiv.38ff.; MT.553f).</p>
<p>Bhātikābhaya once heard of a skilful judgment being given 
by Abhidhammika Godha Thera and laid down a rule that all disputes should be 
taken to the Elder for settlement (Sp.ii.307). On another occasion he appointed 
a brahmin minister, named Dīghakārāyana, to settle a controversy between the 
monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahāvihāra (Sp.iii.583). He had a queen 
called Sāmadevī who was the daughter of a cattle butcher. A large number of 
cattle butchers were once brought before the king, but as they were unable to 
pay the fine demanded, he appointed them as scavengers in the palace. One of 
them had a beautiful daughter, and the king fell in love with her and married 
her. Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived in happiness (VibhA.440).</p>
<p>Bhātikābhaya once heard a Sutta (see A.v.21f ) in which 
the Buddha had declared that, of all perfumes, that of jasmine was the 
strongest. In order to test this the king filled a room with the four kinds of 
perfume and then placed in it handfuls of various flowers, including jasmine. He 
then left the room and shut the door. After a while he entered again, and the 
first scent which greeted him was that of jasmine. Convinced of the truth of the 
Buddha’s statement, he fell prostrate and worshipped him (AA.ii.819). 
</p>
<p>It is said (SA.ii.180) that the king once asked a reciter 
to tell him of an auspicious stanza (jayamangala) connected with all the Three 
Jewels. After thinking for a while, he recited the stanza beginning divā tapati 
ādicco, ratti ābhāti candimā (S.ii.284). At the end of the first pāda, the 
reciter saluted the setting sun, at the end of the second the rising moon, at 
the end of the third the Sangha, and at the end of the stanza he stretched his 
hands upwards in salutation of the Mahā Thūpa. The king asked him to hold his 
hands there and placed in them one thousand pieces.</p>
