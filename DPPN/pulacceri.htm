<h4>1. Pulacceri</h4>
<p>A park laid out by Parakkamabāhu I. Cv.lxxix.11.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pulacceri</h4>
<p>A landing place in Ceylon where Māgha and Jayabāhu set up 
fortifications. Cv.lxxxiii.17.</p>
<p>Pulatthi nagara( pura). A capital of the Singhalese kings. 
It is first heard of in the reign of Aggabodhi III., who built in the town the 
Mahāpānadīpa vihāra (Cv.xliv.122). But it was probably an important centre even 
earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthagāmanī, was probably 
near by (See Codrington, op. cit., 20). Sena I. first made Pulatthipura the 
capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time 
it seems to have been used as a royal residence — e.g., by Aggabodhi IV. 
(Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII. (Ibid.,xlviii.74), and Udaya I. (Ibid.,xlix.9, 18), 
who built a hospital there. Kassapa IV.
is also mentioned as building a hospital against an epidemic 
(Cv.lii.25). </p>
<p>Mahinda II. built in the city the Dāmavihāra parivena and 
the Sannīratittha vihāra (Cv.xlviii.134). Sena I. reigned in Pulatthipura for 
twenty years and erected there several buildings, including the Senaggabodhi 
shrine near the Thusavāpī (Ibid.,l.73). The successors of Sena I. found in 
Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and 
the Pāndiyans; but in the time of Sena V. the town fell into the hands of the 
Damilas, through the treachery of Sena’s mother and his commander in chief, 
Sena. But Sena V. recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in 
chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68). About 1017 A.C. the Colas overran the country, 
captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner. 
He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff). During this 
period many of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected.</p>
<p>For many years the Colas held the sovereignty of the city, 
though the Singhalese made several vain attempts to drive them out. The Colas 
named the city Jananāthapura and put down all rebellion with a strong hand. 
Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of 
Vijayabāhu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura. His first attempts failed, 
partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out 
in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after 
a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land. But, owing to dissensions 
among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his 
coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff). He renamed the city 
Vijayarājapura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which 
was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff). It was not, however, till the 
time of Parakkamabāhu I. that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its 
greatness. He enlarged it to the size of four gāvutas in length and seven in 
width and called it Parakkamapura. The city had three suburbs&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Rāvjavesībhujanga, Rājakulantaka and Vijita — 
and fourteen gates. Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were 
the Nandanavana and the Dīpuyyāna, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both 
secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff). 
Kittinissanka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19). In the 
reign of Līlavatī, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months. 
He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapandu ruled as king, 
till he was deposed about 1215 A.C. by Māgha of the Kalinga race, who, coming 
with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly 
plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff). From this spoliation the city 
never completely recovered, and it gradually lost its importance, though 
Parakkamabāhu II., Vijayabāhu IV. and Parakkamabāhu III. made attempts to 
restore it to its original splendour. Ibid., lxxxvii.67; lxxxviii.28, 35, 89, 
92, 120f.; lxxxix.1.</p>
