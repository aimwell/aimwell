<p>Once, when Mahā Kassapa was at Veluvana 
in Rājagaha, Ānanda returned from a tour in the Dakkhināgiri, with thirty monks, 
mostly youths. They were ill-behaved, and Kassapa blamed Ānanda for going about 
with them, calling him “corn-tramper,” “despoiler of families,” and, finally, “a 
boy.” Ānanda gently reminded him that being grey-haired he could hardly be 
called a boy, but Kassapa refused to listen. Thulla-Nandā, hearing of this, 
vented her displeasure on Kassapa by reminding him that he was once a heretical 
teacher. Kassapa there-upon remonstrated with Ānanda, pointing out that he was a 
very devoted follower and pupil of the Buddha and relating how, on one occasion, 
the Buddha accepted from him the gift of his soft robe, giving him, in return, 
the Buddha’s rag-robe. Well might he, he said, claim to be a real son of the 
Buddha. S.1217ff</p>
