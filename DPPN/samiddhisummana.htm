<p>A Deva who lived in the rājāyatana tree standing at the 
gate of Jetavana. He accompanied the Buddha on his second visit to Ceylon. In 
his last birth he had been a man in Nāgadīpa, and seeing some Pacceka Buddhas 
eating their meal, had provided them with rājāyatana branches with which to 
clean their bowls. The rājāyatana-tree was held as parasol over the Buddha’s 
head on his journey to Ceylon and was left behind in Kalyāni for the Nāgas to 
worship. Mhv.i.52ff.</p>
