<p>Once the Bodhisatta was a monkey in the 
Himalayas and, having been captured by a forester, was given to the king. The 
king grew fond of him, and the monkey learnt the ways of men. The king set him 
free, and when his fellows saw him they insisted on hearing from him how men 
lived. He told them of men’s greed for possessions, and how in each house there 
were two masters, one of them beardless, with long breasts and plaited hair. The 
monkeys, hearing of this folly, stopped their ears and went elsewhere, saying 
they could not bear to live in a place where they had heard such unseemly 
things! That place came thereafter to be called the Garahitapitthi-pāsāna.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
discontented monk. J.ii.184.</p>
