<hr>
<p>1. Araham Sutta.-Would an arahant by 
speaking of “I” and “mine” show thereby proneness to notions of self or soul? 
The Buddha says “No.” He would thereby only conform to common usage in such 
matters (S.i.14-15). Buddhaghosa says that the question was asked by a forest 
devatā who had heard forest-dwelling arahants talk thus. She was worried by the 
question as to whether they had any “māna” at all. SA.i.41.</p>
<p>2. Araham Sutta.-An arahant is one who 
has really seen the arising, ending, etc., of the five grasping groups (upādānakkhandhā). 
S.iii.161.</p>
<p>3. Araham Sutta.-That noble disciple is 
released by perfect insight (sammadaññā) who has really seen the satisfaction 
in, the misery of, the escape from, the five indriyas. S.v.194.</p>
<p>4. Araham Sutta.-The monk who has really 
seen the arising, the perishing, etc., as above (S.v.194).</p>
<p>5. Araham (or Buddha) Sutta.-It is by 
the cultivation of the four iddhi-padā that the Tathāgata is called Arahant or 
Fully Enlightened One (S.v.257).</p>
<p>6. Araham Sutta.-Arahants, fully 
enlightened ones, have full understanding of the four Ariyan truths as they 
really are. S.v.433.</p>
<p>7. Araham Sutta.-Six qualities requisite 
for arahantship. A.iii.421.</p>
