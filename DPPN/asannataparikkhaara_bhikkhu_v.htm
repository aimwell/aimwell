<p>The story of a monk who failed to keep 
his requisites in order. Exposed to rain, sun and white ants, they soon went to 
pieces. His conduct was reported to the Buddha, but when questioned about it, he 
did not show much concern, saying it was a mere trifle. The Buddha showed him 
the folly of his conduct and laid down a rule that no monk should fail to remove 
a bed which he had spread in the open air. DhA.iii.15-16.</p>
