<p>1. Ti-uppalamāliya Thera.-An arahant. In 
the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a monkey on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and, 
having seen the Buddha, he offered him three lotuses. Shortly afterwards he fell 
from a rock, died, and was reborn in heaven. Ap.i.277.</p>
<p>2. Ti-uppalamāliya Thera.-An arahant. 
The same as (1), except that, in this case, the Buddha was Phussa. Ap.i.291.</p>
