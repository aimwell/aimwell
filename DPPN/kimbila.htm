<p>A Sākiyan of Kapilavatthu. He was 
converted with Bhaddiya and four other Sākyan nobles at Anupiyā, shortly after 
the Buddha’s visit to Kapilavatthu (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.112f). The Theragāthā 
Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila 
became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 
and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiyā the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, 
conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing 
into old age. Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine 
and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship. Kimbila seems to 
have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with 
him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that. The Buddha visited them 
at Pācīna-vamsadāya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant 
monks of Kosambī. (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff 
and ThagA.i.275f). They were in the Gosingasālavana when the Buddha preached to 
them the Cūla-Gosinga Sutta, at the conclusion of which, Dīgha Parajana Yakkha 
sang the praises of all three (M.i.205ff). Their number was increased by the 
presence of Bhagu, Kundadhāna, Revata and Ānanda, on the occasion when the 
Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta in the Palāsavana at Nalakapāna 
(M.i.462ff).</p>
<p>In three different places in the 
Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation 
between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made 
to endure long after the Buddha’s death and what were the causes which might 
bring about its early disappearance. The conversation took place in the Veluvana 
(Niceluvana?) in Kimbilā. According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), 
however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the 
Sākyan but another. We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbilā. 
He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births. He 
recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha’s religion 
was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, 
he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse. It was this memory 
of his previous life which prompted Kimbila’s question.</p>
<p>Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is 
reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing. 
Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times. Ānanda intervenes 
and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks 
may learn it and profit thereby.</p>
<p>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, 
Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha’s death he erected a pavilion 
of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235). He is probably to be 
identified with Salalamandapiya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.115; 
iv.126) mentions a story which shows how delicately nurtured Kimbila was. One 
day, in a discussion with his friends, Anuruddha and Bhaddiya, as to where rice 
came from, Kimbila remarked that it came from the granary (kotthe).</p>
