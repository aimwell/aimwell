<p>A Gandhabba. His favourite instrument was the 
Beluvapanduvīnā (q.v.). He was considered a favourite of the Buddha 
(DA.iii.699), and when Sakka visited the Buddha at the Indasālaguhā in order to 
ask him certain questions, he sent Pañcasikha in advance, that he might obtain 
permission for the interview. The episode in given in full in the 
<a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha 
Sutta</a> (D.ii.263ff.).</p>
<p>Pañcasikha approached the Buddha and playing on his vinā, 
sang of the beauties of the Buddha, the Doctrine, Arahants and Love. The verses 
really formed a love poem addressed to his beloved, Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, 
daughter of the Gandhabba Timbarū. The Buddha praised his music and song and 
questioned him about the poem. He confessed that when the Buddha was staying 
under the Ajapāla nirgodba, before the Enlightenment, he (Pañcasikha) had met 
Suriyavaccasā going with her father to dance before Sakka. Pañcasikha thereupon 
fell in love with her; but she favoured the suit of Sikhandi, son of Mātali. 
Pañcasikha thereupon composed a song, which he sang to her. She was greatly 
pleased with the references in the song to the Sākyan sage of whom she had heard 
when she went to the Sudhammāsabhā, (on this occasion Sakka, pronounced his 8 
fold eulogy of the Buddha, contained in the Mahāgovinda Sutta, says Buddhaghosa, 
DA.ii.704) and she consented to marry Pañcasikha. It is said that Sakka blessed 
the marriage in return for Pañcasikha’s intercession with the Buddha on his 
behalf.</p>
<p>In the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.211; also in the 
Mahāgovinda Sutta, D.ii.230) it is stated that when Brahmā Sanankumāra appeared 
before the assembly of the gods of Tāvatimsa and materialized himself he assumed 
the form of Pañcasikha. Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.640), by way of explanation, 
that all the devas loved Pañcasikha and wished to resemble him. In the 
Mahāgovinda Sutta (D.i.220; cp. Mtu.iii.197ff) Pañcasikha is represented as 
conveying to the Buddha a full report of the happenings in the assembly of the 
devas, when Sakka spoke the Buddha’s praises.</p>
<p>No really satisfactory explanation is found in the 
Commentaries of Pañcasikha’s name. Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.647) Pañcasikho ti 
pañcacūlo, pañcakundaliko, and goes on to say that Pañcasikha was born once as a 
human being, and, while yet a boy wearing his hair in five knots* (pañcacūlakadāraka 
kāle), he became chief of those who tended the calves. </p>
<p>* This is done even now in Ceylon, where young boys' hair 
is tied round their heads in several knots. But in one place (DA.i.296) 
Buddhaghosa says that one way of insulting a man was to shave his head, leaving 
him five locks of hair (garahāyā ti pañcasikhā mundakaranam). And, again 
(SA.i.171), he mentions that Sanankumāra retained his eternal youth because in a 
previous life he had developed jhāna while yet a lad (pañcasikhakumārakāle). See 
also J.vi.496, where a traitor had his hair tied in five knots as a sign of 
disgrace.</p>
<p>Together with other lads he engaged in works of public 
utility, such as repairing roads, digging wells, building rest houses, etc., and 
he died while young. He was reborn in the Cātummahārājika world, destined to 
live for ninety thousand years, his body three gāvutas in height. He wore on his 
person one hundred cartloads of ornaments and rubbed nine pots of perfume on his 
body. He wore red robes, and on his head a chaplet of red gold, round which his 
hair was arranged in five locks (kuntalikehi), which fell back as in the case of 
a young boy (pañcacūli-kadārakaparihāren'eva).</p>
<p>It was Pañcasikha who first received from the king of the 
Cātummahārājika worlds and their ministers reports of good deeds done by human 
beings. These he would pass on to Mātali, who, in his turn, presented them to 
Sakka (DA.ii.650). On the day of the Devorohana, when the Buddha descended from 
Tāvatimsa, Pañcasikha was present to render honour to the Teacher in song and 
music (DhA.iii.225; AA.i.72; Vsm.392). According to the legends (E.g., 
Mhv.xxx.75; xxxi.82) he was present with the Buddha on other occasions as well.</p>
<p>Pañcasikha was evidently not only the name of a person, 
but also of an office (like Sakka), for in the Bilārakosiya Jātaka (q.v.) Ānanda 
is said to have been born as Pañcasikha and to have helped Sakka and others to 
make of Bīlārakosiya a generous man (J.iv.69). Similarly, in the Sudhābhojana 
Jātaka (q.v.), Anuruddha is identified with Pañcasikha. J.v.412.</p>
