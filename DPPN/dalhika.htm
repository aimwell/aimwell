</ul>
<p>A monk of <a href="sagala.htm" title="sa/sagala.htm">Sāgala</a>.  </p>
<p>A pupil of his once 
stole a turban from a shopkeeper and confessed his fault to Dalhika, thinking 
that he would, on that account, become a pārājika.  </p>
<p>But the value of the turban 
was less than five māsakas and the pupil was saved from a pārājika-offence.
