<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as minister 
to Dalhadhamma, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. The king possessed a she-elephant who was of 
great service to him and whom he greatly honoured.</p>
<p>When she grew old, however, all her 
honours were withdrawn and she was given to the king’s potter to drag his 
cow-dung cart. One day she saw the Bodhisatta and fell at his feet. He 
interceded with the king on her behalf and all her honours were restored.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Udāna’s she-elephant Bhaddavatikā (q.v.). In her old age the king neglected her, 
but one day she complained to the Buddha, who admonished the king on the duty of 
gratitude to those who had once been of great service. The elephant was the same 
in both stories. J.iii.384ff.</p>
