<p>A Therī. She belonged to a family in 
Ujjeni and was the playmate of Abhayamātā (Padumavatī). When the latter joined 
the Order, Abhayā, too, left the world. As she was meditating in Sītavana, the 
Buddha sent forth a ray of glory to encourage and help her; she thereupon became 
an arahant (ThigA.33-4). </p>
<p>Two verses are attributed to her in the 
Therīgāthā (35, 46).</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha she was born 
in a noble family and became the chief queen of the Buddha’s father, Arunavā. 
One day she offered to the Buddha some lotuses which the king had given her. As 
a result, in later births her body was the colour of the lotus and bore the 
perfume of the lotus.</p>
<p>Seventy times she reigned as queen of 
heaven and she was chief queen of sixty-three cakkavattis (ThigA. loc. cit.). 
She is evidently to be identified with Sattuppalamālikā of the Apadāna 
(ii.517-18).</p>
