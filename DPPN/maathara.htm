<p>(v.l. Matthara). </p>
<p>A parrot belonging to Mahosadha. When Mahosadha wished to 
find out the plans of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, he sent Māthara to the mynah that 
lived in Cūlanī’s bedchamber. Māthara made love to her, pretending that he had 
come from Aritthapura to ask her to marry him, because his first wife (also a 
mynah) had been killed by a hawk. He related the stories of Vāsudeva and 
Jambāvatī and of Vaccha and Rattavatī, to prove that husband and wife need not 
be equal in birth. Having won her heart and discovered Cūlanī’s secrets, Māthara 
flew back to Mahosadha (J.vi.418ff). He is identified with Ānanda. J.vi.478.</p>
