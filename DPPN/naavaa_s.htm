<h4>1. Nāvā Sutta</h4>
<p>also called Damma Sutta. Itwas preached in reference to 
Sāriputta’s habit when he was on tour of worshipping the direction in which his 
teacher, Assaji, lived. Others noticed this and said it was a relic of his old 
brahmanic habit of worshipping the different quarters. But the Buddha said there 
was no need of Sāriputta to do that, for even the devas themselves worshipped 
him. In the sutta the wise man is compared to a ship (nāvā) which takes many 
others across. SN.vs. 316 23; SNA.i.325ff.</p>

<h4>3. Nāvā Sutta</h4>
<p>If a sea going vessel is left stranded on the bank, it is 
dried up by the wind and sun in the dry season and rotted by water in the rains&nbsp;&nbsp; 
so are the fetters in the case of a monk who cultivates the Ariyan Eightfold 
Path. S.v.51.</p>
