<p>A mutinga (kettle-drum) belonging to the 
Dasārahas. As it grew old and began to split, they fixed in another peg, and 
this process was continued, until, at last, the original drumhead vanished, 
leaving only the framework of pegs (S.ii.266). The origin of the drum is related 
in the Kakkata Jātaka. When the Golden Crab, there mentioned, was trampled to 
death by the elephants, his two claws broke away from his body and lay apart in 
the Kulīradaha, where he lived. During the floods the water flowed from the 
Ganges into this lake, running back again when the floods subsided. The two 
claws were thus carried into the Ganges. One of them reached the sea, and the 
Asuras, picking it up, made thereof the drum named Ālambara. The other was 
picked up by the Ten Royal Brothers (evidently the Dasārahas mentioned above) 
while playing in the river, and they made of it the little drum Ānaka (J.ii.344; 
the Jātaka is quoted in SA.ii.167-8, with several variations in detail).</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Commentary (ii.167-8) it 
is said that the drum was like molten wag in colour, because the crab’s claw had 
been dried by wind and sun. The sound of the drum was heard for twelve leagues, 
and it was, therefore, used only on festive occasions. On hearing it, the people 
assembled hurriedly, in various conveyances, decked with splendour. It was 
called Ānaka because it brought the people together as if summoning them (mahājanam 
pakkositvā viya ānetī ti Ānako). </p>
<p>Later, when the original drumhead had 
vanished, it could hardly be heard even inside a hall.</p>
<p>The Ānaka drum is used as a simile in 
the Āni Sutta (S.ii.266-7; see also KS.ii.178, n.4).</p>
