<p>One of the disciples of Bāvarī 
(Sn.v.1007). The questions he asked the Buddha, when he visited him in the 
company of his colleagues, are recorded in the Upasīva-mānava-pucchā 
(Sn.vv.1069-76). Upasīva joined the Order and became an arahant. According to 
the Apadāna (ii.345ff), in the time of Padumuttara he had been an ascetic in a 
mountain named Anoma, near Himavā. Once the Buddha visited his hermitage and the 
ascetic spread a seat for him with grass and flowers and gave him fruit to eat. 
He also gave the Buddha a quantity of fragrant aloe-wood. As a result, he was 
born in heaven for thirty thousand kappas and was seventy-one times king of the 
devas. The Apadāna-account makes no mention of Bāvarī.</p>
