  <h2>Gonaraviya Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A monk of Ceylon, probably a colleague 
of Mahāsīva. It is said that Mahāsīva was explaining to him the Mahā Saccaka 
Sutta, and that when he came to the passage where the Buddha charges Saccaka 
with not understanding the training of the body, much less that of the mind, 
Gonaraviya laid aside his fan and walked away, saying that the Buddha could not 
have said such a thing; but Mahāsīva persuaded him that it was so. v.l. Moranāla. 
MA.i.463.</p>
