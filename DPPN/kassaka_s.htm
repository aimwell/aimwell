  <h2>Kassaka Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Once the Buddha was at S훮vatthi 
preaching to the monks on nibb훮na. M훮ra appears in the guise of a peasant, 
dishevelled, wearing hempen garments, with a mighty plough on his shoulder, and 
asks the Buddha if he has seen his oxen. The Buddha declares, unequivocally, 
that he has no eyes for things owned; having escaped completely from worldly 
desires, possessions and ownership, his mind furnishes no gateway for M훮ra. 
S.i.114.</p>
