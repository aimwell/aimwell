<h2>Nanda Jataka (No. 39)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a squire, and he had as 
friend another squire who was old and whose young wife bore him a son. In order 
that the son might not be deprived of his wealth, the old squire took his slave 
Nanda into his confidence and buried the money, charging Nanda to deliver it to 
his son after his death. The old man died and, at his mother’s suggestion, the 
son asked Nanda to show him where the wealth was buried. Nanda took him to the 
place in the forest, but as soon as he started digging, the thought of being 
able to get the money for himself so elated him that he started abusing his 
master. The young man pretended not to hear, and said they would go some other 
time. Several times the same thing happened, and at last the son decided to 
consult his father’s friend, the Bodhisatta. The latter told him to note where 
Nanda started digging, and then to dig there himself and so get the treasure. 
This he did and found the money, which he made Nanda carry home.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a co resident of 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sariputta</a>. He was by nature very modest, but when he went on tour the attentions 
he received made him proud and insolent.  </p>
<p>He is identified with Nanda of the 
Jataka. J.i.224ff.</p>
