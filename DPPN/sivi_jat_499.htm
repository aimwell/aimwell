  <h2>Sivi Jātaka (No. 499)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as Sivi, king of Aritthapura, 
his father bearing the same name as himself. He ruled well, and daily gave alms 
to the amount of six hundred thousand. One day the desire came to him to give 
part of his body to any who might ask for it. Sakka read his thoughts, and, 
appearing before him as a blind brahmin, asked for his eyes. The king agreed to 
give them, and sent for his surgeon Sivaka. Amid the protests and lamentations 
of his family and his subjects, Sivi had his eyes removed and given to the 
brahmin. It is said that the surgeon did his work in several stages, giving Sivi 
chances of withdrawing his offer. When the sockets healed Sivi wished to become 
an ascetic, and went into the park with one attendant. Sakka’s throne grew hot, 
and appearing before Sivi, he offered him a boon. The king wished to die, but 
Sakka insisted on his choosing something else. He then asked that his sight 
might be restored. Sakka suggested an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), as not even 
Sakka could restore lost sight. The eyes reappeared, but they were neither 
natural eyes nor divine, but eyes called “Truth, Absolute and Perfect.” Sivi 
collected all his subjects, and, resting on a throne in a pavilion, taught them 
the value of gifts.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Pasenadi’s 
Asadisadāna. On the seventh day of the almsgiving the king gave all kinds of 
requisites and asked the Buddha to preach a thanksgiving sermon, but the Buddha 
left without doing so. The next day, on being questioned by the king, he 
explained his reasons for this (For details see <a href="asadisadaana.htm" title="ay/asadisadaana.htm">Asadisadāna</a>). The king, greatly 
pleased with the Buddha’s explanation, gave him an outer robe of Siveyyaka cloth 
worth one thousand. When the monks started commenting on how tireless the king 
was in giving, the Buddha related to them the old story, in which Ānanda is 
identified with Sivaka, the physician, and Anuruddha with Sakka (J.iv.401-12; 
of. CypA.52f).</p>
<p>The Sivirājacariyā is included in the Cariyāpitaka 
(Cyp.i.8; the story is also given with variant details in the Avadānasataka 
i.183-6). It forms the topic of one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha. 
Mil.p.119f.</p>
