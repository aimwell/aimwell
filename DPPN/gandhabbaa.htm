  <h2>Gandhabbā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A class of semi-divine beings who 
inhabit the Cātumma-hārājika-realm and are the lowest among the devas 
(D.ii.212). They are generally classed together with the 
<a href="asura.htm" title="ay/asura.htm">Asuras</a> and the Nāgas 
(E.g., A.iv.200, 204, 207). Beings are born among them as a result of having practised the lowest form of sīla (D.ii.212, 271).</p>
<p>It is a disgrace for a monk to be born 
in the Gandhabba-world (D.ii.221, 251, 273f). The Gandhabbas are regarded as the 
heavenly musicians, and <a href="pancasikha.htm" title="pa/pancasikha.htm">Pañcasikha</a>, 
<a href="suriyavaccasaa.htm" title="s/suriyavaccasaa.htm">Suriyavaccasā</a> and her father 
<a href="timbaru.htm" title="t/timbaru.htm">Timbarū</a> are 
among their number (D.ii.264).  </p>
<p>They wait on such devas as Sakka, and the males 
among them form the masculine counterpart of the accharā, the nymphs. Their king 
is <a href="dhatarattha.htm" title="d/dhatarattha.htm">Dhatarattha</a>, ruler of the eastern quarter (D.ii.257). Other chieftains are 
also mentioned (D.ii.258): Panāda, Opamañña, Sakka’s charioteer Mātalī, 
Cittasena, Nala and Janesabha.  </p>
<p>The Gandhabbas are sometimes described as 
vihangamā (going through the air) (A.ii.39; AA.ii.506). 
In the Ātānātiya Sutta (D.iii.203, 204) the Gandhabbas 
are mentioned among those likely to trouble monks and nuns in their meditations 
in solitude. The Buddha says that beings are born among the Gandhabakāyikā devā 
because they wish to be so; they are described as dwelling in the fragrance of 
root-wood, of bark and sap, and in that of flowers and scents (S.iii.250f).</p>
<p>It is often stated that the Gandhabbas 
preside over conception; this is due to an erroneous translation of the word 
gandhabba in passages (E.g., M.i.157, 265f) dealing 
with the circumstances necessary for conception (mātāpitaro ca sannipatitā honti, 
mātā ca utunī hoti, gandhabbo ca paccupatthito hoti).  </p>
<p>The Commentaries (E.g., 
MA.i.481f ) explain that here gandhabba means tatrūpakasatta 
- tasmim okāse nibbattanako satto — meaning a being fit and ready to be born to 
the parents concerned. The Tīkā says that the word stands for gantabba. See also 
Gandhabbarājā.</p>
