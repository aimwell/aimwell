<p>A household of Vesalī, a pious follower 
of the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was staying in Vesalī, a poor man, wishing 
to give alms to him and to the monks, asked Kirapatika for money to provide the 
alms; Kirapatika gladly gave him much money and the Buddha and the monks were 
invited. But the monks, having heard of the man’s poverty, had a full meal 
earlier, so that when the man served them with the food he had prepared they 
could eat but very little. The man was greatly offended and the Buddha, hearing 
of it, made an order to the monks prohibiting such conduct (Vin.iv.75f).</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iv.817) that the 
householder’s name was Kira, but that he was called Kirapatika on account of his 
great influence. He gave his workmen regular and generous wages.</p>
