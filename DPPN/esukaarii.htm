<p><b>1. Esukārī.</b>-A brahmin who visits the 
Buddha at Jetavana and asks him various questions on castes and their 
distinctions, from the point of view of their functions. The Buddha replies that 
birth’s invidious bar has been laid down by the brahmins, without consulting 
anybody else; all four castes alike can live the good life, which is the true 
service, and follow the Dhamma, which is the true wealth. At the end of the 
discourse Esukārī declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.177ff).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Esukārī.</b>-King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He and his 
chaplain were great friends; neither of them had any sons. They agreed that if 
either of them should have a son the possessions of both should be given to him. 
By the intercession of a tree-sprite the chaplain had four sons — Hatthipāla, 
Assapāla, Gopāla, and Ajapāla. But when they grew up, one after the other, they 
renounced the world, and were later joined by the chaplain and the king, with 
all their retinues.</p>
<p>Esukārī was a previous birth of 
Suddhodana. </p>
<p>The story is related in the Hatthipāla 
Jātaka. J.iv.473ff.</p>
