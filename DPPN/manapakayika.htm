<p>A class of devas possessing lovely forms. Once a large 
number of them visited <a href="anuruddha.htm" title="ay/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> at the
<a href="ghositaaraama.htm" title="g/ghositaaraama.htm">Ghositirāma</a> and announced to him that in 
a trice they could assume any colour they desired, produce any sound, and obtain 
any happiness. Anuruddha tested their claims and found them to be true.  </p>
<p>Some of 
them sang, some danced, some clapped, some played on various musical 
instruments, but finding that their entertainment was lost on Anuruddha, they 
left him. Anuruddha told the Buddha of their visit, and the Buddha explained to 
him the eight qualities, the possession of which enabled women to be born among 
the Manāpakāyikā. A.iv.265ff., also ibid., 268, where the Buddha speaks of them 
to <a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a>; cf. AA.ii.773.</p>
