Khemā gave him three meal cakes and cut off her hair as an offering to him 
(ThigA.127; AA.i.187). Dhammadinnā also did obeisance to him and offered him 
alms (ThigA.196; MA.i.516).</p>

<p><b>9. Sujāta Thera.</b> He was a brahmin of Benares,

Vāsitthī Therī, and from her he heard about the Buddha, whom he visited at 
Mithilā.</p>
<p>He entered the Order under the Buddha, attaining 
arahantship on the third day (ThigA.229).</p>

his bright expression.</p>

<p><b>10. Sujāta.</b> A householder of Benares. He once went 
to hear the leader of a company of ascetics preach in the royal park and spent 
the night there. During the night, he saw Sakka arrive with his apsarases to pay 
homage to the ascetics, and he fell in love with one of them. His passion for 
her was so great that he died of starvation. The story is given in the 
Mahāsutasoma Jātaka. J.v.468f.</p>

Benares. See the Sujāta Jātaka (3).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>12. Sujāta. </b>Son of the Assaka king in Polanagara. 
He was expelled from the country at the request of his stepmother and lived in 
the forest. At that time Mahā Kaccāna, following on the holding of the First 
Council, was living in the Assaka country. One of Sujāta’s friends, a devaputta 
in Tāvatimsa, appeared before Sujāta in the shape of a deer, and, after leading 
him to Mahā Kassapa, disappeared. Sujāta saw the Thera and talked with him. Mahā 
Kassapa saw that Sujāta had but five months to live, and, after stirring up his 
mind, sent him back to his father, urging him to good deeds. When the king heard 
his story he sent a messenger for Mahā Kaccāna. Sujāta lived another four months 
and, after death, was reborn in Tāvatimsa. Later he visited Mahā Kaccāna to show 
his gratitude and revealed his identity.</p>
<p>The story is known as the Cūlarathavimāna. Vv.v.13; 
VvA.259-270.</p>

<p><b>13. Sujāta.</b> Called Sujāta Pippalāyana of Mahātittha.
