<h2>Kūtadanta</h2>
<p>A very learned brahmin of Khānumata, 
which village had been given to him by King Bimbisāra as a brahmadeyya. The 
Buddha arrived at Khānumata when Kūtadanta was making preparations for a great 
sacrifice and, wishing this sacrifice to be successful, he consulted the Buddha 
on the holding of sacrifices. The Buddha preached to him the Kūtadanta Sutta. At 
the end of the discourse he became a Sotāpanna (D.i.127ff). </p>
<p>The conversion of Kūtadanta is 
considered one of the great spiritual victories won by the Buddha (E.g., 
J.vi.329). As a disputant, Kūtadanta is classed with Ambatthaka, Sonadanda and 
Saccaka. E.g., MA.ii.697.</p>
