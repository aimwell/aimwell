<p>A householder of Nāgakāragāma. He gave 
alms for many years to Maliyamahādeva Thera and the monks of Piyangudīpa. Once, 
on his way to Suvannabhūmi, he was shipwrecked, but was rescued by Sīhabāhu 
Thera and brought to Piyangudīpa. There he saw Sakka and was provided with a 
ship full of valuables. The king having heard of him gave him Dantagāma.
