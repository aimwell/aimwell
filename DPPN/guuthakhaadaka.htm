<p>1. Gūthakhādaka. A peta. A householder, 
in a village near Sāvatthi, built a vihāra for a monk who visited his house. 
Other monks arrived, and the incumbent, envious of them, spoke ill of them to 
the householder who abused them all. As a result, he was born a peta in the 
cesspit of the same monastery and came under the notice of Mahā Moggallāna. 
Pv.iv.18; PvA.266f; cp. ThagA.i.386f.</p>
<p>2. Gūthakhādaka. Same as the above, 
except that in this case the householder was a woman. Pv.iv.9; PvA.269.</p>
