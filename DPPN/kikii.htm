</ul>
<p>King of Benares at the time of the 
Buddha Kassapa. When the Buddha arrived in Benares, the king, having listened to 
his sermon, entertained the Buddha and his monks at the palace. When the Buddha 
was asked to spend the rainy season there he refused, as he had already accepted 
the invitation of Ghatīkāra of Vehalinga. Kikī was at first hurt by the refusal, 
but when the Buddha described Ghatīkāra’s virtues, the king was pleased and sent 
five hundred cartloads of provisions to Ghatīkāra who, however, curtly refused 
the gift (D.ii.7; M.ii.49ff).</p>
<p>One of Kikī’s daughters was <a href="uracchadaa.htm" title="u/uracchadaa.htm">Uracchadā</a>, 
who attained arahantship at the age of sixteen. He had seven other daughters — 
Samanī, Samanā, Guttā, Bhikkhudāsikā, Dhammā, Sudhammā and Sanghadāsī — who, in 
this Buddha-age became respectively Khemā, Uppalavannā, Patācārā, Gotamā, 
Dhammadinnā, Mahāmāyā and Visākhā. J.iv.481; in the Ap.ii.561f, the names are 
Samanī, Samapaguttā, Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā, Dhammā, etc., and they are 
mentioned as having lived celibate lives; see also Sattamba; both the Apadāna 
and the ThigA.17, 103f, omit the name of Mahāmāyā from this list and have, 
instead, the name of Bhaddā Kundalakesā, identifying her with Bhikkhadāyikā. The 
Mtu.i.303f mentions another daughter Mālinī Kisāgotamī.</p>
<p>He had also a son, Pathavindhara (Puthuvindhara), 
who succeeded him to the throne (ThagA.i.151). During the life of the Buddha 
Kassapa Kikī waited on him with many kinds of gifts (SnA.i.281, 283), and at his 
death built one of the four gates outside the Buddha’s cetiya. The gate was a 
league in width (SnA.i.194). According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.420), 
Kikī was the aggupatthāka of Kassapa.</p>
<p>In the Sanskrit books he is called Kikī, 
and is mentioned as owning a palace called Kokanada (E.g., Mtu.i.325; Divy.22f; 
Avadānas i.338, etc.).</p>
