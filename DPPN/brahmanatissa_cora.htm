<p>Reference is made in the Ceylon Chronicles and in some of 
the Commentaries to a period of great distress in Ceylon, owing to the 
activities of a cora (? brigand) called Brāhmanatissa in the time of Vattagāmanī<span lang="en-us">-Abhaya 
(Pitirājā). </p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa and the Mahāvamsa Tīkā 
(Mhv.xxxiii.37ff.; MT.613), Tissa was a brahmin youth of Rohana. One day he 
heard a brahmin soothsayer announce that if a brigand were to commence his 
activities under a certain combination of planets, he would conquer the whole of 
Ceylon. Tissa, acting on this idea, turned robber and sent word to the king that 
he should hand over his throne to him. At the same time seven Damilas, with 
their followers, arrived in Mahātittha with the same demand. The king thereupon 
sent word to Tissa that the kingdom would be his if he could defeat the Damilas. 
Tissa agreed to this and marched against them, but was taken captive in a battle 
near Sanketahāla. The Pāli Commentaries give further details. Tissa plundered 
the land for twelve long years; food became so scarce that, owing to starvation, 
people lost even their sexual desires, and the birth of a child was such a rare 
occurrence that all the land rejoiced over such a birth (SA.ii.83). Tissa’s 
activities were at their height when Vattagāmanī was in hiding. The stores of 
food in Cittalapabbata vihāra and in Tissamahārāma were laid waste by enormous 
rats and the monks could obtain no food, Tissa having ravished the land. They 
therefore sent eight Theras to Sakka, begging him to rid the country of Tissa; 
but Sakka sent reply that he was powerless, and suggested that the monks should 
go over the seas. Some took his advice and sailed from Jambukola, but the 
leaders of the community <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
Samyuttabhānaka Cūlasīva, Isidatta and Mahāsona <span lang="en-us">-&nbsp; 
remained behind awaiting better times (see also Nāgā Therī, whose story given in 
AA.ii.654f.; also MA.i.546). The Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura was deserted; the 
Mahā Thūpa was overgrown with trees. The monks had to live on lotus stalks and 
fruit rinds thrown away by the people. When Brāhmanatissa died, Vattagāmanī once 
more came to the throne (VibhA.445<span lang="en-us">-51). 
v.l. Brāhmanatiya cora (from which the Ceylon Chronicles derive the form 
Bāminitiyā). About the date of the Bāminisāya (the brahmin famine as it was 
called in Sinhalese), see Cv. Trs. Introd. xvii., section 4.</p>
<p>See also Canndāla Tissa (Candāla Tiya) which evidently 
refers to this same “bhaya.”</p>
