<p><b>1. Vimala.</b> One of the four friends of Yasa who, 
following the latter’s example, joined the Order and 
attained arahantship. Vin.i.18f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vimala Thera.</b> He belonged to a rich family of 
Rājagaha and received his name because he was born free of all dirt. Much 
impressed by the majesty of the Buddha when the latter visited Rājagaha, Vimala 
entered the Order, and lived in a mountain cave in Kosala. One day a vast cloud 
spread over the sky; rain fell, allaying the heat and discomfort, and Vimala, 
concentrating his mind, attained arahantship.</p>
<p>He belonged to a family of conch blowers in the time of 
Vipassī Buddha, and one day honoured the Buddha by playing on his conch shell. 
He bathed the Bodhi tree of Kassapa Buddha with fragrant water and washed the 
seats and the clothes of holy monks. Twenty four kappas ago he was king six 
times, under the name of Mahānigghosa. ThagA.i.121f; his Udāna verse is included 
in Thag.vs.50.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Vimala Thera.</b> He was born in a brahmin family of 
Benares and entered the Order under Somamitta Thera, who encouraged him to 
attain arahantship. In the story of Somamitta, however, Vimala is said to have 
been his teacher. For details see Somamitta. In the days of Padumuttara Buddha 
he was a householder, and, when the Buddha’s body was being carried to the pyre 
for cremation, amidst impressive celebrations, he offered sumana flowers in his 
honour. ThagA.i.377; three verses ascribed to him 
occur in Thag.vs.264-6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vimala. </b>A Pacceka Buddha. M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Vimala. </b>One of the palaces of Piyadassī Buddha 
before his renunciation. Bu.xiv.16.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Vimala.</b> A king of sixty one kappas ago, a former 
birth of Udakadāyaka (Sānu) Thera. Ap.i.205; ThagA.i.115.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Vimala. </b>A king of twenty one kappas ago who 
lived in the palace Suddassana in Renuvatī. He was a former birth of Rāhula. 
Ap.i.61.</p>
