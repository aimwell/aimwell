<p>1. Cetokhila Sutta.-While the five 
fallows of his heart (cetokhilā) are left untilled — doubts about the Teacher, 
about the Dhamma, about the Order and the course of training, lack of ardour — 
and the five bondages are unshattered (attachment to sensual pleasures, to the 
body, to visible forms, over-eating, desire to be born among the gods) — no monk 
can possibly show growth and progress in the Dhamma and the Vinaya. M.i.101ff</p>
<p>2. Cetokhila Sutta.-The five fallows (cetokhilā) 
mentioned in (1). In order to destroy them the four Satipatthāna should be 
developed. A.iv.460.</p>
