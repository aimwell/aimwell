  <h2>Apacara</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A king of the first kappa. He was the 
son of Cara and reigned in Sotthivatī-nagara in the <a href="cetiya.htm" title="c/cetiya.htm">Cetiya</a> country. He was one 
of the ancestors of the Sākiyan race. He belonged to the race of 
<a href="mahasammata.htm" title="maha/mahasammata.htm">Mahāsammata</a> and was possessed of four 
iddhi-powers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>walking on air, </li>
  <li>being guarded by four devas, </li>
  <li>diffusing the fragrance of sandalwood from his body </li>
  <li>and the fragrance of the lotus from his mouth.</li>
</ul>
<p>When he was prince he had promised to 
appoint as his family priest his fellow-student Kosakalamba, brother of the 
royal chaplain <a href="kapila.htm#2" title="ka/kapila.htm#2">Kapila</a>, when he should become king. But when Apacara came to the 
throne, Kapila obtained the post for his own son and became an ascetic. When the 
king realised what had happened he offered to get the post back for Kosakalamba 
by means of a lie. The latter protested, because lies had hitherto been unknown 
in the world; but the king persisted in his desire even in spite of Kapila’s 
warning, and seven times in succession uttered a lie to the effect that the post 
of chaplain belonged by right of seniority to Kosakambala and not to Kapila’s 
son. At the first lie he lost his iddhi-powers and fell to earth, and with each 
succeeding lie he fell deeper and deeper into the earth until the flames of 
Avīci seized him. He was the world’s first liar.</p>
<p>He had five sons, who sought Kapila’s 
protection, and leaving the city founded five cities, which were called 
<a href="h.htm#Hatthipura" title="h/h.htm#Hatthipura">Hatthipura</a>, <a href="assapura.htm" title="ay/assapura.htm">Assapura</a>, 
<a href="siihapura.htm" title="s/siihapura.htm">Sīhapura</a>, <a href="uttarapancaala.htm" title="u/uttarapancaala.htm">Uttarapañcāla</a> and Daddarapura, because of 
certain tokens connected with them (for details see under those names). 
 
</p>
<p>According to the Sutta Nipāta Commentary (ii.352) Makhādeva was his son. The 
king was a previous birth of <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>. The story is related in the
<a href="c1h.htm#Cetiya-Jataka-422" title="c/c1h.htm#Cetiya-Jataka-422">Cetiya 
Jātaka</a> (J.iii.454-61; see also Mhv.ii.2.; DA.i.258f.; Dpv.iii.5). v.l. Upacara, 
Upavara and Uparuvara. The Milinda (p.202) calls him Suraparicara.</p>
