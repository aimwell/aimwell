<p><b>1. Kātiyānī (v.l. Kaccānī).</b>-A lay 
devotee, declared by the Buddha to be most eminent among women for unwavering 
loyalty (aveccappasāda) (A.i.26). She resolved to win this eminence in the time 
of Padumuttara Buddha. In this age she was born in the city of Kuraraghara and 
she had a devoted friend called Kālī. One day she went with Kālī to hear the 
thera Sona Kutikanna preach to his mother, and while she was there thieves 
entered her house. The servant girl, who was sent to fetch oil for lighting the 
lamps, brought news of the presence of the thieves, but Kātiyāni refused to 
leave until the thera’s sermon should be finished. The leader of the thieves, 
who had watched the incident, was so pleased with her that he gave orders that 
all the goods stolen from her house should be restored. At the end of the sermon 
Kātiyāni became a sotāpanna. The next day the thieves came and asked her 
forgiveness. She took them to the Elder, who ordained them, and there they all 
became arahants. AA.i.245f</p>
