<p>King of <a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a> in the time of the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. His name was Pajjota, the sobriquet being added on account of his 
violent temper. </p>
<p>Once, when ill with jaundice, he asked 
<a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a> to lend him the services of 
<a href="jiivaka.htm" title="j/jiivaka.htm">Jīvaka</a>, as no other doctor could cure him. 
The cure for the malady was ghee, for which Pajjota had a strong aversion. 
Jīvaka, therefore, decided to administer it disguised in an astringent 
decoction, and obtained the king’s permission to use any of the royal animals or 
to leave the city at any time he wished, on the plea that he must go in search 
of various medicines. When all preparations were complete, Jīvaka gave the king 
the medicine and escaped on Bhaddavatikā, the king’s she-elephant, before the 
truth was discovered. (The elephant could travel fifty yojanas in one day, and 
<a href="kaaka.htm" title="ka/kaaka.htm">Kāka</a>, sixty). The king sent Kāka in pursuit, but Jīvaka gave Kāka a purgative 
and so delayed his return until the medicine had taken effect on the king. 
Later, when Pajjota was cured, he sent Jīvaka many costly presents, including a 
garment of Siveyyaka cloth (Vin.i.276ff; AA.i.216).</p>
<p>King <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a> was Pajjota’s rival in 
splendour, and Pajjota decided to take him captive by taking advantage of his 
fondness for elephants. The plan succeeded and Udena was taken prisoner, but in 
the end Udena eloped with Pajjota’s daughter, <a href="vaasuladattaa.htm" title="va/vaasuladattaa.htm">Vāsuladattā</a>, and made her his 
queen consort. Besides the she-elephant and the slave Kāka, already mentioned, 
Pajjota had three other fleet-footed conveyances: two mares, Celakanthī and 
Muñjakesī, both capable of travelling one hundred leagues a day, and an 
elephant, Nālāgiri, able to go one hundred and twenty leagues a day. In a past 
birth Pajjota had been the servitor of a certain chief. One day, when the chief 
was returning from the bath, he saw a Pacceka Buddha leaving the city, where he 
had begged for alms without receiving anything. The chief hurried home and, 
finding that his meal was ready, sent it to the Pacceka Buddha by the hand of 
his fleet-footed servant. The servant travelled with all possible haste and, 
having given the meal to the Pacceka Buddha, expressed certain wishes, as the 
result of which in this birth he gained possession of the five conveyances. He 
had authority equal to the power of the sun’s rays. (This may be another 
explanation of the nickname Canda). His last wish was that he should partake of 
the Truth realised by the Pacceka Buddha (DhA.i.196ff).</p>
<p><a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> was the son of Pajjota’s 
chaplain and later succeeded to his father’s post. When the king heard of the 
Buddha’s appearance in the world, he sent Kaccāna with seven others to the 
Buddha, to bring him to Ujjeni. But the Buddha sent Kaccāna and his companions, 
now become arahants, to preach to the king and establish the Sāsana in Avanti. 
The mission was successful. The Theragāthā contains stanzas uttered by the Thera 
in admonition to the king. It is said that the king had faith in the brahmins 
and held sacrifices involving the slaughter of animals; he was wicked in his 
deeds. One night he had a dream which frightened him and went to the Thera to 
have it explained. The Thera told him of the necessity for leading a virtuous 
life. We are told that from that day the king abandoned his evil ways and lived 
righteously (Thag.vs.496-501; ThagA.i.483ff; AA.i.116f).</p>
<p>According to the Dulva (Rockhill, op. 
cit., 17), Pajjota was the son of Anantanemi and was born on the same day as the 
Buddha. He was called Pajjota (Pradyota), because at the time of his birth the 
world was illumined as if by a lamp. He became king of Ujjeni at the time of the 
Buddha’s Enlightenment (Rockhill, op. cit., 32, n.1). He had a minister called 
Bharata, a clever mechanic (Rockhill, op. cit., 70, n.1).</p>
<p>It would appear from the Samantapāsādikā 
(Sp.i.214) that Pajjota was born as the result of an ascetic, or some other holy 
person, having touched the navel of his mother.</p>
<p>Pajjota was the friend of Bimbisāra, and 
when the latter was put to death by <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, Pajjota seems to have made 
preparations to wage war on Ajātasattu. The defences of Rājagaha were 
strengthened to meet the threatened attack, but nothing further happened 
(M.iii.7).</p>
<p>The <a href="sarabhanga_jat_522.htm" title="sa/sarabhanga_jat_522.htm">Sarabhanga Jātaka</a> (J.v.133) mentions 
a king Canndapajjota, in whose dominion was Lambacūlaka, where lived the ascetic 
Sālissara. This either refers to another king of the same name or, more 
probably, it is an attempt to identify Lambacūlaka with some place in the 
country over which Pajjota ruled in the time of the Buddha.</p>
