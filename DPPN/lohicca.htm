<p><b>1. Lohicca. </b>A brahmin of Makkarakata in Avanti. Once when Mahā Kaccāna 
was living there in a forest hut, a number of Lohicca’s pupils came there and 
began abusing the monks, calling them shavelings, menials, etc. Kaccāna talked 
to them, telling them how degenerate were the brahmins, differing from brahmins 
of old, the present ones being backsliders, mere reciters, doing things for 
trifling gains. The pupils went back to Lohicca and told him this. Lohicca 
visited Kaccāna and discussed with him these statements, and, at the end of the 
talk, declared himself Kaccāna’s follower. S.iv.117ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Lohicca. </b> A brahmin of Sālāvatikā. He once conceived the idea that a samana or recluse 
who had reached a good state of mind should tell no one else of it, lest he 
should entangle himself in new bonds. When the Buddha went to Sālāvatikā Lohicca 
sent the barber, Bhesikā, to invite the Buddha and the monks in his name. The 
Buddha accepted the invitation, and, at the end of the meal, questioned Lohicca 
regarding his views. At the end of the discussion Lohicca became the Buddha’s 
follower. D.i.224ff.</p>
