<p>The story of a peta mentioned in the 
Lakkhana Samyutta. </p>
<p>She was seen going through the air, 
parched and sooty, uttering cries of distress. Moggallāna declares (S.ii.260; 
SA.ii.163) that she had once been the head queen of a king of Kalinga. 
</p>
<p>One day, seeing the king show fondness 
for a dancer who was massaging him, she was moved with jealousy and scattered a 
brazier of coals over the woman’s head.</p>
