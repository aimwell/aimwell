</ul>
<p>A brahmin of Vettavati. Mātanga incurred 
his wrath by throwing his toothpick so that it fell into the river and stuck in 
Jātimanta’s hair. The latter therefore cursed Mātanga that his head should split 
in seven. Mātanga stopped the sun from rising till Jātimanta was forced to ask 
his pardon. J.iv.388f; in SA. (ii.176f.) the reason given for the curse was that 
Mātanga happened to tread on Jātimanta’s head.</p>
