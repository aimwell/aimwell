  <h2>Asātamanta Jātaka (No. 61)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once a famous teacher 
in Takkasīlā. A young brahmin of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> came to study under him and, after 
completing his course, went back home. His mother, however, was anxious that he 
should renounce the world and tend Aggibhagavā in the forest. She accordingly 
sent him back to the Teacher that he might learn the “Asātamanta” (Dolour Text). 
The Teacher had a mother aged 120 years, on whom he himself waited. When the 
youth came back to learn the Asātamanta, he was asked to look after the old 
woman. She, falling in love with him, hatched a plot to kill her son. 
</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta, having been told of this 
plot, made a wooden figure and placed it in his bed. The mother, thinking to 
kill her son, struck it with an axe, and discovering that she had been betrayed, 
fell down dead. The youth, having thus learnt the Asātamanta, returned to his 
parents and became a hermit. Kāpilānī was the mother in the story, Mahā Kassapa 
the father and Ānanda the pupil.</p>
<p>This story, together with the <a href="ummadantii_jat_527.htm" title="u/ummadantii_jat_527.htm">Ummadantī 
Jātaka</a>, was related to a passion-tossed monk to warn him of the evil nature of 
women. J.i.285-9.</p>
