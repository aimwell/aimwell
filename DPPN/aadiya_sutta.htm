<p>Preached at Jetavana to Anāthapindika on 
the five uses (ādiyā) of possessions legitimately obtained: one enjoys them 
oneself; entertains with them one’s friends and relations; uses them in times of 
need; employs them in the discharge of one’s duties to the king, to religion, to 
one’s relations, both living and dead; and in doing good deeds which will bring 
happiness in future lives. A.iii.45f.</p>
