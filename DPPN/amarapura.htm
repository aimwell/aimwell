<p>A city of Burma, founded by King 
Bod調ay캐 (Bode, p.74; S캐s.130). The Elder N캐n캐bhivamsa lived there and was head 
of the group of monks known as the Amarapura sect. </p>
<p>These monks, later, took to Ceylon a 
number of P캐li texts, these being either of Burmese authorship or else better 
known to the Burmese fraternity than to the Sinhalese. Bode, p.78.</p>
