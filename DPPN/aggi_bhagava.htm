  <h2>Aggi-Bhagava</h2>

<p>A deity (probably identical with the 
Vedic Agni), worship of whom brought, as reward, birth in the Brahma-world. On 
the day a son is born, a fire (jātaggi) is kindled; when the son comes of age 
and wishes to renounce household life, this fire is taken to the forest and 
homage is paid to Aggi-Bhagavā (J.i.285).</p>
<p>In the <a href="nanguttha_jat_144.htm" title="n/nanguttha_jat_144.htm">Nanguttha Jātaka</a> (J.i.494-5) the 
Bodhisatta, having received an ox as a gift, wishes to offer the flesh to Aggi-Bhagavā, but thinking that the deity will not relish a salt less meal, he 
goes away in search of salt. He returns to find that the ox has been eaten by 
hunters, only the tail, one leg and the skin being left. “If thou, Aggi-Bhagavā, 
hast not the power to look after thine own, how canst thou guard me?” So saying, 
he quenches the fire with water and becomes an anchorite. In the verses of this 
context Aggi is addressed as <a href="j.htm#Jataveda" title="j/j.htm#Jataveda">Jātaveda</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="santhava_jat_162.htm" title="sa/santhava_jat_162.htm">Santhava Jātaka</a> (J.ii.43-5), too, 
the Bodhisatta is a votary of the deity. Once when he makes an offering of milk 
mixed with ghee the flames blaze forth and burn his hut, and thereupon he loses 
faith. In this story Aggi-Bhagavā seems to be identified with Mahā Brahmā. See 
also KS.i.209, n.4.</p>
<p>In the exegesis to the <a href="bhuridatta_jat_543.htm" title="b/bhuridatta_jat_543.htm">Bhuridatta Jātaka</a> 
(J.vi.202), the deity is spoken of as Aggideva, and mention is made of an 
enquiry made of learned brahmins by a king, Mujalinda, as to the way to heaven. 
In answer he is told that Aggideva is the brāhmanadevatā par excellence, and 
that he should be offered fresh ghee. See also <a href="j.htm#Jataveda" title="j/j.htm#Jataveda">Jātaveda</a>.</p>
