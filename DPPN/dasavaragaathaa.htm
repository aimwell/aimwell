<p>The section of the Vessantara Jātaka 
containing the account of the ten boons granted by Sakka to Phusatī just before 
she left Sakka’s world to be born as Madda’s daughter. These ten boons were: to 
be chief queen of the Sivi kingdom, to have dark eyes and dark eyebrows, to be 
named Phusatī, to have a son, to keep a slim figure, to have firm breasts, not 
to become grey-haired, and to save the condemned. J.vi.482-4.</p>
