<p>A singila-bird, seeing a monkey 
shivering in the rain, suggested to him that he should build a nest. The monkey, 
in envy, destroyed the bird’s nest.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
novice <a href="ulunka_saddaka.htm" title="u/ulunka_saddaka.htm">Ulunkasaddaka</a>, who had burnt down 
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā-Kassapa’s</a> hut in a forest near 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. At that time Mahā Kassapa had two novices, one serviceable and helpful 
and the other ill-behaved. Whatever was done by his comrade the latter would 
pretend that he himself had done it. One day, in exasperation, the good novice 
heated water for the Elder’s bath and then hid it in a back room, leaving only a 
little in the boiler. When the other novice saw the steam rising he informed the 
Elder that his bath was ready. When asked where was the water, he let a ladle 
down into the almost empty boiler and the ladle rattled. When the story became 
known he was nick-named Ulunkasaddaka (“Rattle-ladle”).</p>
<p>Being found fault with on this and 
several other occasions, he bore the Elder a grudge, and one day, having set 
fire to the Elder’s hut, he ran away. Later he was born first as a peta and then 
in <a href="aviici.htm" title="ay/aviici.htm">Avīci</a>. This incident was reported to the Buddha by monks who came from 
Rājagaha.</p>
<p>The monkey of the Jātaka is identified 
with the wicked novice. J.iii.71ff.</p>
