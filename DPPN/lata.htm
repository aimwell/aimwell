<p>A woman of <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. </p>
<p>She was good and holy, and after 
death was born as a daughter of <a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a>.  </p>
<p>Her sisters were Sajjā, Pavarā, 
Acchimatī and Sutā.  </p>
<p><a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> married them all, and when a dispute arose as to which 
was the most skilled in dance and song, a contest was held on the banks of the
<a href="anotatta.htm" title="ay/anotatta.htm">Anotatta</a>, in which Latā won. Sutā asked Latā 
how she acquired her great talents, and the latter gave an account of her good 
deeds as a human being. </p>
<p>Later, the story was related to
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> on one of his visits to 
the deva worlds, and was repeated by him to the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>.
