  <h2>Jatilag캐h캶</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a bhikkhun캶, who, so 
nanda tells Ud캐y캶, came to see him at the A침janavana in S캐ket캐. The nun asked 
him for what purpose the Buddha requested that sam캐dhi should be practised and 
nanda answered that it was for the purpose of obtaining insight (A.iv.427f).
</p>
<p>The Commentary (AA.ii.812) says that the 
bhikkhun캶 was so called because she came from a city called Jatilagaha.</p>
