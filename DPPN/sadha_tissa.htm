</ul>
<p>1. King of Ceylon (77 59 B.C.). He was the brother of 
Dutthagāmanī and was about a year younger. When he was ten, at the ceremony of 
initiation, he was forced to make a vow that he would never fight against his 
brother; but when his father, Kākavannatissa, died, he seized the throne in the 
absence of Dutthagāmanī. Up to that time he had been in charge of the Dīghavāpi 
district. Dutthagāmanī now made war upon him, but was defeated at 
Cūlanganiyapitthi. Later the tide turned, and Tissa had to flee to a monastery. 
Dutthagāmanī surrounded the monastery, but some young monks carried Tissa out on 
a bed, covered up like a dead body. Gāmanī discovered the ruse, but refrained 
from action. Through the intervention of Godhagatta Tissa Thera, the brothers 
were reconciled, and, thereafter, seem to have been devoted to one another.</p>
<p>After Gāmanī’s conquest of Anurādhapura, Tissa seems to 
have returned as governor of Dīghavāpi. When Gāmanī lay dying, Tissa was sent 
for to complete the work of the Mahā Thūpa, that the king might see it before 
his death. This he got done by means of temporary structures, cunningly devised. 
He was enjoined to retain unimpaired all the services on behalf of the religion 
inaugurated by his brother, and, when the latter died, he was succeeded by 
Tissa, who ruled for eighteen years. He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda after it was 
burnt down, and erected many vihāras — Dakkhināgiri, Kallakālena, Kalambaka, 
Pettangavālika, Velangavitthika, Dubbalavāpitissaka, Dūratissaka, Mātuvihāraka 
and Dīghavāpi. He built a vihāra to every yojana on the road from Anurādhapura 
to Dīghavāpi. He had two sons, Lañjatissa and Thūlathana.</p>
<p>Tissa was reborn after death in Tusita, and will be the 
second Chief Disciple of Metteyya Buddha. Mhv.xxii.73, 83; xxiv2ff.; xxxii.83; 
xxxiii.4 17; Dpv.xx 2, 4ff. </p>
<p>He was a very pious king, entirely devoted to the cause of 
religion. Various stories are mentioned about him in the Commentaries (See, 
e.g., Kālabuddharakkhita). He once walked five leagues to Mangana to pay his 
respects to Kujjatissa (q.v.) (AA.i.384f). On another occasion, he gave snipe to 
a novice from Kanthaka sālaparivena who would, however, accept only very little. 
Pleased with his moderation, the king paid him great honour (AA.i.264). He seems 
to have been specialty fond of the monks of Cetiyagiri (See VibhA.473). He was, 
apparently, also known as Dhammika Tissa. Dhammika Tissa once distributed one 
hundred cartloads of sugar (gula) among twelve thousand monks. A seven year old 
novice was sent by a monk who had just come to Cetiyagiri from Anurādhapura to 
fetch for him some sugar, about the size of a kapittha fruit. The attendant 
offered to give him a plateful, but the novice refused to take so much. The king 
heard the conversation, and, pleased with the novice, sent a further four 
hundred cartloads of sugar to be given to the Order (E.g., SA.iii.48). See also 
the story of Kukkutagiri.</p>

<p><b>2. Saddhātissa</b>.-A minister. He 
once gave to Pindapatikatissa Thera of Sudassanapadhanasala a bowl of food which 
he had bought for 8 kahapanas. The monk became an arahant before eating it. The 
deity of the king’s parasol applauded and king Saddhātissa having sent for him 
gave him the district of Vaddhamanananagara. Later he shared with 30,000 monks 
water brought to him by the devas during a drought. The king hearing of this 
gave him Antaraganga. Sometime afterwards he became a sotāpanna, gladdened by 
the sight of 12,000 monks walking round Ambatthala cetiya clad in robes given by 
him. Ras.ii.9f.</p>
