  <h2>Sakka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>1. Sakka</h4>
<p>Almost always spoken of as “devānam indo,” chief (or king) 
of the devas. </p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.229; DhA.i.264) contains a list 
of his names:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">he is called Maghavā, because as a human being, in a former birth, 
he was a brahmin named Magha. (But see Magha; cf. Sanskrit Maghavant as an 
epithet of Indra).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">As such he bestowed gifts from time to time, hence his name Purindada (Cf. Indra’s epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) (generous giver 
in former births or giver in towns).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Because he gives generously and thoroughly 
(sakkaccam) he is known as Sakka. Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an 
adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, 
capable.” It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Because he gives away dwelling places (āvasatham) he is 
called Vāsava (But see Vāsava).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Because in one moment he can think of one 
thousand matters, he is called Sahassakkha (also Sahassanetta).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Because he 
married the Asura maiden Sujā, he is called Sujampati. For the romantic story of 
Sakka’s marriage, see <a href="sujaa.htm" title="s/sujaa.htm">Sujā</a>. Thus Sujā’s father, 
<a href="vepacitti.htm" title="vy/vepacitti.htm">Vepacitti</a>, became Sakka’s 
father in law. Several quaint stories are related about father&nbsp; and son in 
law. The two sometimes quarrelled and at others lived together in peace 
(SA.i.265).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Because he governs the devas of 
<a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> he is called Devānam Indo (See 
<a href="inda.htm" title="i_/inda.htm">Inda</a>).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Elsewhere (E.g., D.ii.270; M.i.252) Sakka is addressed 
as <a href="kosiya.htm" title="ku/kosiya.htm">Kosiya</a>.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">He is also spoken of as Yakkha. M.i.252; cf. S.i.206 (Sakkanāmako 
Yakkho); at S.i.47 Māghadevaputta (Sakka) is called Vatrabhū, slayer of Vrtra 
(SA.i.83);  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 8">Sakka is also, in the Jātakas, called Gandhabbarāja (J.vi.260) and 
Mahinda (J.v.397, 411).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sakka rules over <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> devaloka, the lowest heaven but 
one of the lower plane. His palace is <a href="vejayanta.htm" title="vy/vejayanta.htm">Vejayanta</a> and his chariot bears the 
same name. Though king of the Tāvatimsa devas, he is no absolute monarch. He is 
imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan. The devas meet 
and deliberate in the Sudhammā sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than 
issues them commands. On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in 
the assembly with their followers of the <a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world (See, e.g., 
D.ii.207f., 220f). Among the Tāvatimsa devas, Sakka is more or less primus inter 
pares, yet lie surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, 
happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: 
sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. A.iv.242; these are also attributed 
to the rulers of the other deva worlds.</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.228, 229, 231; cf. Mil. 90; 
for details of these see Magha) the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which 
rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial 
sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and 
orders of Sakka. For details of Sakka’s conquest of the Asuras see 
<a href="asura.htm" title="ay/asura.htm">Asura</a>. The 
Asuras called him Jara Sakka (J.i.202). Pajāpati, Vamna and Isāna are also 
mentioned as having been associated with him in supreme command (S.i.219).</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya a whole Samyutta — 
one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas — 
is devoted to Sakka. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the first and second suttas Sakka praises energy 
  (viriya); </li>
  <li>in the third he denounces timidity; </li>
  <li>in the fourth he shows forbearance to his enemy; (*16)</li>
  <li>in the fifth lie advocates the conquest of anger by 
  kindness; </li>
  <li>in the sixth kindness to animals; </li>
  <li>in the seventh he denounces trickery, even towards 
  enemies; </li>
  <li>and in the ninth he preaches courtesy and honour 
  towards the wise. </li>
  <li>In the eleventh are described the seven life long 
  habits which raised him to his present eminent position;</li>
  <li>twelve and thirteen repeat this and explain his titles.
  </li>
  <li>In the fourteenth Sakka explains how new gods, who 
  outshine the old ones, do so because they have observed the Buddha’s teaching.
  </li>
  <li>In the fifteenth he describes as the most beautiful 
  spot that where arahants dwell; </li>
  <li>in the sixteenth he praises gifts to the Order (*17);
  </li>
  <li>in the seventeenth he praises the Buddha, but is told 
  by Sahampati that he has selected the wrong attributes for praise. 
  </li>
  <li>In eighteen to twenty he says that whereas brahmins and 
  nobles on earth and the gods of the Cātummahārājika world and of Tāvatimsa 
  worship him, he himself worships good men and arahants. </li>
  <li>Numbers twenty one, twenty two, twenty four and twenty 
  five are against anger, and twenty three is against deceit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>*16 The enemy, in this case, is his father-in law, 
    Vepacitta. Sakka had a reputation for great forbearance. In sutta 22 a 
    Yakkha is said to have come and to have sat on his throne, to anger him. But 
    Sakka showed him great honour and the Yakkha vanished. The Commentary adds 
    (S.A.i.272) that it was no Yakkha, but a Rūpāvacara Brahmā, named 
    Kodhabhakkha, who had come to test Sakka’s patience.</p>
    <p>*17 The story connected with this sutta is that of 
    Sakka, seeing the people of Anga and Magadha make preparations for a great 
    sacrifice to Mahā Brahmā, feels pity for them and comes among them in the 
    guise of Brahmā, advising them to take their offerings to the Buddha and 
    seek his counsel (SA.i.270).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These and other passages show that Sakka was considered by 
the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not 
perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of 
his very great age, (*18) he is still subject to death and rebirth (A.i.144); as 
an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been 
reborn as Sakka (A.iv.105), a statement confirmed by the Buddha (A.iv.89). Sakka 
is not free from the three deadly evils — lust, 
ill will, Stupidity (*22); nor is he free from anxiety. He is timid, given to 
panic, to fright, to running away. (*23)</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>*18 At J.ii.312, Sakka’s life is given as lasting 
    thirty million and sixty times one hundred thousand years.</p>
    <p>*22 A.i.144. The story of Rohini shows that Sakka was 
    very susceptible to the charms of beauty. He evidently liked other people to 
    enjoy life and sent a heavenly dancer to amuse Mahāpanāda when nobody on 
    earth could accomplish that feat (SNA.ii.400). On another occasion, as Sakka 
    was rejoicing in his triumph over the Asuras, he saw a crane on a hill top 
    who wished to be able to eat fish without going down into the stream. Sakka 
    immediately sent the stream in full flood, to the hill top (J.iii.252).</p>
    <p>*23 He is mentioned in the Jātakas as frightened of 
    ascetics who practised severe penances, lest they should unseat him from his 
    throne, e.g., J.ii.394; also the stories of Visayha, Lomasakassapa, Kanha, 
    Akitti, Mahā Kañcana and Isisinga.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta (q.v.), Sakka is said to have 
visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasandā and to have asked him a series of 
questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and 
to obtain permission for him (Sakka) to visit him and question him. It was Sakka 
who had given the Beluvapanduvīnā to Pañcasikha (SNA.ii.394).</p>
<p>The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time 
past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any 
subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta (D.ii.270) that it was not the 
first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had 
gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthi, but found him in meditation, with 
Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavana, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to 
Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares (D.ii.286) that he 
has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn 
eventually in the Akanitthā world, whence he will pass entirely away.</p>
<p>The Commentary says that Sakka was constantly seeing the 
Buddha and was the most zealous of the devas in the discharge of his duties to 
the sāsana. DA.iii.697. In the sutta Sakka admits (D.ii.284) that he visited 
other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted 
that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew. But 
this visit to the Buddha at Vediyagiri had a special object. Sakka saw sips that 
his life was drawing to an end and was frightened by this knowledge. He 
therefore went to the Buddha to seek his help. It adds (DA.iii.732; cp. 
DhA.iii.270) that, as Sakka sat listening to the Buddha, he died in his old life 
and was reborn a new and young Sakka; only Sakka himself and the Buddha was 
aware of what had happened. The Commentary continues (DA.iii.740) that Sakka 
became an “uddham sota,” treading the path of Anāgāmīs. As such he will live in 
Avihā for one thousand kappas, in Atappa for two thousand, in Sudassanā for four 
thousand, and will end in the Akanittha world, after having enjoyed life in the 
Brahmaworlds for thirty one thousand kappas.</p>
<p>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the 
Buddha is given in the Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta (q.v.). There the question arises 
regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and 
leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s 
teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions 
and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then 
frightens him by a display of iddhi-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for 
word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his 
handmaidens that Moggallāna is a “fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, 
probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.
</p>
<p>In a passage in the Samyutta (S.i.201) Sakka is 
represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in 
another (S.iv.269f.), as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the 
simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavana’s 
suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened 
to a sermon by him (A.iv.163f.). See also Sakka Sutta (2) and (3).</p>
<p>The later books contain a good deal of additional 
information regarding Sakka. His city extends for one thousand leagues, and its 
golden streets are sixty leagues long; his palace Vejayanta is one thousand 
leagues high; the Sudhammā hall covers five hundred leagues, his throne of 
yellow marble (Pandukambalasilāsana) is sixty leagues in extent, his white 
umbrella with its golden wreath is five leagues in circumference, and he himself 
is accompanied by a glorious array of twenty five million nymphs (J.v.386). 
Other features of his heaven are the Pāricchattaka tree, the Nandā pokkharanī 
and the Cittalatāvana (DA.iii.716; See also Tāvatimsa). His body is three 
gavutas in height (DhA.iii.269); his chief conveyance is the marvellous elephant 
Erāvana (q.v.), but he goes to war in the Velayanta ratha (q.v.). Reference is 
often made to his throne, the Pandukambalasilāsana (q.v.), composed of yellow 
stone. It grows hot when Sakka’s life draws towards its end; or his merit is 
exhausted; or when some mighty being prays; or, again, through the efficacy of 
virtue in recluses or brahmins or other beings, full of potency. J.iv.8; when 
the Buddha, however, sat on it, he was able to conceal it in his robe 
(DhA.iii.218).</p>
<p>Sakka’s devotion to the Buddha and his religion is 
proverbial. When the Bodhisatta cut off his hair and threw it into the sky, 
Sakka took it and deposited it in the Cūlāmani cetiya (J.i.65). He was present 
near the Bodhi tree, blowing his Vijayuttara sankha (q.v.), when Māra arrived to 
prevent the Buddha from reaching Enlightenment (J.i.72). When the Buddha 
accepted Bimbisāra’s invitation to dine in his palace, Sakka, in the guise of a 
young man, preceded the Buddha and his monks along the street to the palace, 
singing the Buddha’s praises (Vin.i.38). When the Buddha performed his Yamaka 
pātihārīya at the foot of the Gandamba, it was Sakka who built for him a 
pavilion, and gave orders to the gods of the Wind and the Sun to uproot the 
pavilions of the heretics and cause them great discomfort (DhA.iii.206, 208). 
When the Buddha returned to Sankassa from Tāvatimsa, whither he went after 
performing the Twin Miracle, Sakka created three ladders — 
of gold, of silver, and of jewels respectively — 
for the Buddha and his retinue (DhA.iii.225).</p>
<p>Sakka was present at Vesāli when the Buddha visited that 
city in order to rid it of its plagues. His presence drove away the evil 
spirits, and the Buddha’s task was thus made easier (DhA.iii.441). When the 
Buddha and his monks wished to journey one hundred leagues, to visit Culla 
Subhaddā at Uggapura, Sakka, with the aid of Vissakamma, provided them with 
pavilions (kūtāgāra) in which they might travel by air (DhA.iii.470). Once, when 
the ponds in Jetavana were quite dry, the Buddha wished to bathe and Sakka 
immediately caused rain to fall and the ponds were filled (J.i.330). In Sakka’s 
aspect as Vajirapāni (q.v.) he protected the Buddha from the insults of those 
who came to question him. See also the story of Ciñcā mānavikā, when Sakka 
protected the Buddha from her charges. Sakka also regarded it as his business to 
protect the Buddha’s followers, as is shown by the manner in which he came to 
the rescue of the four seven year old novices — 
Sankicca, Pandita, Sopāka and Revata — when they 
were made to go hungry by a brahmin and his wife (DhA.iv.176f.).</p>
<p>During the Buddha’s last illness, Sakka ministered to him, 
performing the most menial tasks, such as carrying the vessel of excrement. 
DhA.iv.269f. He did the same for other holy men — 
e.g., Sāriputta. Sakka also waited on the Buddha when he was in Gayāsīsa for the 
conversion of the Tebhātikajatilas (Vin.i.28f.); see also the story of Jambuka 
(DhA.ii.59). The Udāna (iii.7) contains a story of Sakka assuming the guise of a 
poor weaver and Sujā that of his wife, in order to give alms to Mahā Kassapa who 
had just risen from a trance. They succeeded in their ruse, to the great joy of 
Sakka (cp. DhA.i.424f). On other occasions — e.g., in the case of Mahāduggata&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sakka helped poor men to gain merit by providing them with the means for giving 
alms to the Buddha (DhA.ii.135ff.).</p>
<p>He was present at the Buddha’s death, and uttered, in 
verse, a simple lament, very different from the studied verses ascribed to 
Brahmā. (D.ii.157; on the importance of this verse, however, see Dial.ii.176, 
n.1). At the distribution, by Dona, of the Buddha’s relics, Sakka saw Dona hide 
the Buddha’s right tooth in his turban. Realizing that Dona was incapable of 
rendering adequate honour to the relic, Sakka took the relic and deposited it in 
the Cūlāmanicetiya (DA.ii.609). And when Ajātasattu was making arrangements to 
deposit his share of the relics, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to set up a 
vālasanghātayanta for their protection (DA.ii.613).</p>
<p>Sakka did all in his power to help followers of the Buddha 
in their strivings for the attainment of the goal, as in the case of 
Panditasāmanera, when he sent the Four Regent Gods to drive away the birds, made 
the Moon deity shroud the moon, and himself stood guard at the door of Pandita’s 
cell, lest he should be disturbed. (DhA.ii.143; cf. the story of Sukha 
DhA.iii.96f.). Often, when a monk achieved his ambition, Sakka was there to 
express his joy and do him honour. See, e.g., the story of Mahāphussa 
(SNA.i.55f.).</p>
<p>He was ready to help, not only monks and nuns, but also 
eminent laymen, such as Jotika for whom he built a palace of wondrous splendour, 
and provided it with every luxury (DhA.iv. 207f). Sakka was always ready to come 
to the rescue of the good when in distress — 
e.g., in the case of Cakkhupāla when he became blind; Sakka led him by the hand 
and took him to Sāvatthi. DhA.i.14f. Many instances are found in the Jātaka 
where Sakka rescued the good in distress — e.g., 
Dhammaddhaja, Guttila, Kaccāni, the Kinnarī Candā, Sambulā, Kusa, Mahājanaka’s 
mother, Candakumāra’s mother, Candā, and Mahosadha.</p>
<p>He loved to test the goodness of men, as in the case of 
the leper Suppabuddha, to see if their faith was genuine. DhA.ii.34f.; see also 
the story of the courtesan in the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.380).</p>
<p>The Jātaka contains several stories of his helping holy 
men by providing them with hermitages, etc. — 
e.g., Kuddāla pandita, Hatthipāla, Ayoghara, Jotipāla (Sarabhanga), Sutasoma, 
Dukūlaka, Pārikā and Vessantara. Sometimes, when he found that ascetics were not 
diligently practising their duties, he would frighten them — 
e.g., in the Vighāsa and Somadatta Jātakas. The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.370f ) 
contains a story of Sakka punishing a deva called Supatittha, who lived in a 
banyan tree, because he failed to keep the rukkhadhamma.</p>
<p>Sakka appears as the guardian of moral law in the world. 
When wickedness is rampant among men, or kings become unrighteous, he appears 
among them to frighten them so that they may do good instead evil. He is on the 
side of the good against the wicked, and often helps them to realize their goal. 
Instances of this are seen in the Ambacora, Ayakūta, Udaya, Kaccāni, Kāma, 
Kāmanīta, Kumbha, Kelisīla, Kharaputta, Culladhanuggaha, Dhajavihetha, 
Bilārikosiya, Manīcora, Mahākanha, Vaka, Sarabhanga, Sarabhamiga and 
Sudhābhojana Jātakas. Sakka patronised good men; some of the more eminent he 
invited to his heaven, sending his charioteer Matali to fetch them, and he 
showed them all honour — e.g., Guttila, Mandhātā, 
Sādhina, and Nimi; others he rewarded suitably — &nbsp;see, 
e.g., the Uraga Jātaka.</p>
<p>The lesser gods consulted Sakka in their difficulties and 
problems e.g., in the case of the deity of Anāthapindika’s fourth gateway, who 
incurred the displeasure of Anāthapindika by advising him to refrain from too 
much generosity towards the Buddha and his monks (J.i.229). Sakka has also to 
deal with disputes arising among the devas themselves (DA.iii.705). On several 
occasions Sakka helped the Bodhisatta in the practice of his Perfections&nbsp;&nbsp; 
e.g., as King Sivi, Temiya, Nimi and Vessantara, also in his birth as a hare; in 
this last story, the Sasa Jātaka (q.v.), Sakka paints the picture of a hare in 
the moon to commemorate the Bodhisatta’s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sakka sometimes answers the prayers of good and barren 
women and gives them sons — e.g., Sumedhā, 
Sīlavatī, Candādevī. Mention is also made of other boons granted by Sakka to 
various persons. Thus in the Mahāsuka Jātaka he visited the parrot who clung to 
the dead stump of a tree through gratitude, and granted him the boon that the 
tree should once more become fruitful (J.iii.493). He granted four boons to 
Kanha, that he might be calm, bear no malice or hatred against his neighbour, 
feel no greed for others' glory, and no lust towards his neighbour (J.iv.10). To 
Akitti he granted several boons, the last of which was that he should have no 
more visits from Sakka! (J.iv.240f). When Sivi became blind, Sakka gave him two 
eyes; these were not natural eyes, but the eyes of Truth, Absolute and Perfect (saccapāramitā 
cakkhunī). Sakka confesses that he has not the power of restoring sight; it was 
the virtue of Sivi himself which had that power (J.iv.410f). When Sīlavatī 
wished for a boon, Sakka, took her to heaven, where he kept her for seven days; 
then he granted that she should have two sons, one wise and ugly and the other a 
fool and handsome. He also presented her with a piece of kusa grass, a heavenly 
robe, a piece of sandalwood, the flower of the Pāricchattaka tree and a Kokanda 
lute. All this passed into the possession of Kusa, and, later, Sakka gave him 
the Verocana jewel (J.v.280f., 310). He gave Phusatī, mother of Vessantara, ten 
boons (J.vi.481f) and to Vessantara himself he gave eight (J.vi.572).</p>
<p>In the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.392) mention is made of four 
daughters of Sakka — Āsā, Saddhā, Hirī and Sirī. 
His wife, Sujā, accompanied him everywhere on his travels (E.g., J.iii.491), 
even into the world of men, because that was the boon she had asked for on her 
marriage to him (DhA.i.279). Vessavana was Sakka’s special friend (MA.i.476f), 
and when one Vessavana died, it was Sakka’s duty to appoint a successor 
(J.i.328). Matāli (q.v.) is Sakka’s charioteer and constant companion. 
Vissakamma (q.v.) is his “handy man.” Sakka has twenty five million handmaids 
and five hundred dove-footed nymphs (kakutapādiniyo), famed for their beauty. It 
was the sight of these which tempted the Buddha’s step brother, Nanda, to give 
up thoughts of Janapadakalyānī Nandā (J.ii.93). Sakka’s special weapon is the 
Vajirāvudha and his special drum the Ālambara (q.v.).</p>
<p>His voice is sweet, like the tintinnabulation of golden 
bells (SA.i.273).</p>
<p>It is Sakka’s special duty to protect the religion of the 
Buddha in Ceylon. As the Buddha lay dying, he enjoined on Sakka the task of 
looking after Vijaya and his successors. This duty Sakka, in turn, entrusted to 
the god Uppalavanna (Mhv.vii.1ff). Sakka informed Mahinda of the right moment 
for his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.15). When Devānampiyatissa wished for relics 
to place in the Thūpārāma Thūpa, Sumana sāmanera visited Sakka and obtained from 
him the right collar bone of the Buddha, which Sakka had placed in the Culāmani 
cetiya (Mhv.xvii.9ff). Again, when Dutthagāmanī was in need of building 
materials for the Mahā Thūpa, it was Sakka who supplied them (Mhv.xxviii.6ff). 
On the occasion of the enshrining of the relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Sakka gave 
orders to Vissakamma to decorate the whole of Ceylon. He also provided the 
throne and casket of gold for the relics brought from the Nāgā world by 
Sonuttara and was himself present at the festival, blowing his conch shell. 
(Mhv.xxxi.34, 75, 78)</p>
<p>Other Cakkavālas have also their Sakka (aññehi Cakkavālehi 
Sakkā āgacchanti; J.i.203.), and in one place (J.i.204) mention is made of many 
thousands of Sakkas.</p>
<p>It is evident from the foregoing account that, as Rhys 
Davids suggests (Dial.ii.297f), Sakka and Indra are independent conceptions. 
None of the personal characteristics of Sakka resemble those of Indra. Some 
epithets are identical but are evidently borrowed, though they are differently 
explained. The conception of the popular god which appealed to a more barbarous 
age and to the clans fighting their way into a new country, seems to have been 
softened and refined in order to meet the ideals of a more cultured and peaceful 
civilization. The old name no longer fitted the new god, and, as time went on, 
Sakka came to be regarded as an entirely separate god.</p>
