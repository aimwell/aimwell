<p>A monk should cultivate in-breathing and 
out-breathing in order to achieve all his desires in the spiritual life. He will 
then understand things as they really are and, when his bodily endurance has 
reached its limit, he will know that it is so, like a lamp which will go out 
when oil and wick are used up. S.v.316ff.</p>
