<p>The name given to one of the stories of 
the Petavatthu. The peta referred to had been a resident near Veluvana. Once he 
was going along the road eating a sugar cane and carrying a bundle of sugar 
canes. Behind him came another man of good conduct, with a child. The child, 
seeing the sugar cane, begged for some of it with great lamentations. The good 
man wishing to console the child, walked up to the sugar cane-eater and tried to 
make friends. His efforts were, however, unsuccessful, and when he begged for a 
piece of sugar cane for the child, the man sulkily threw him a bit from the end 
of the sugar cane. This man, after his death, was born as a peta. Around him was 
a forest of sugar canes, but whenever he attempted to eat any of them he got 
badly bruised and wounded. One day Moggallāna saw him, and having discovered his 
antecedents told him about his past profitless life. He made the peta get for 
him a piece of sugar cane, which he offered to the Buddha and the monks. As a 
result of this, the peta was reborn in Tāvatimsa. Pv., pp.61f; PvA.257ff.</p>
