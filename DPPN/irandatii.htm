<p>A Nāga maiden, daughter of the Nāga 
King, Varuna. </p>
<p>When she learned that her mother, Vimalā, 
longed for the heart of Vidhura, she determined to get for herself a husband who 
would satisfy her mother’s craving. So she went to the Himālaya and having 
spread a bed of fragrant flowers, lay thereon and sang. Vessavana’s nephew, a 
yakkha, Punnaka, heard her and offered himself as her husband. She took him to 
her father who agreed to give him Irandatī, if he could bring Vidhura’s heart. 
When Punnaka fulfilled this condition, as described in the Vidhura-pandita 
Jātaka, Irandatī became his wife. J.vi.263-327.</p>
