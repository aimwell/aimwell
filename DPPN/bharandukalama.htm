</ul>
<p>A recluse, once a co-disciple of 
the Buddha in the holy life. Once, when the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu and 
wanted lodging for the night, <a href="mahanama_th.htm#3" title="maha/mahanama_th.htm#3">Mahānāma</a> suggested that he should go to the 
hermitage of Bharandu. The Buddha acted on this suggestion and spent the night 
there.  </p>
<p>When Mahānāma arrived the next morning, the Buddha talked to him about 
the three kinds of teachers:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>those who have full comprehension of sense desires only but not of objects 
  of sense or of feelings; </li>
  <li>those who have full comprehension of sense desires and of objects of 
  sense; and </li>
  <li>those who have comprehension of all three. </li>
</ul>
<p>Would their conclusions coincide, or would they 
differ?  </p>
<p>Here Bharandu chimed in and asked Mahānāma to say they would be the 
same. But the Buddha contradicted him, whereupon Bharandu said they would be 
different; but the Buddha again contradicted him, and even, also, a third time. 
Grieved at being slighted by the Buddha in the presence of Mahānāma, an 
important <a href="sakya.htm" title="sa/sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a>, Bharandu left 
<a href="kapilavatthu.htm" title="ka/kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a>, never to return (A.i.276 f).</p>
<p>The Commentary explains (AA.i.458) that he had lived in 
the same hermitage as the Buddha, when they were both pupils of 
<a href="aalara_kaalaama.htm" title="aa/aalara_kaalaama.htm">Alārakālama</a>.</p>
<p>Bharandu had the reputation of being able to secure the 
best and choicest alms in the city.</p>
