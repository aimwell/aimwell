<p><b>1. Candābha Thera</b>.-An arahant. He 
belonged to a wealthy brahmin family of Rājagaha and was called Candābha because 
from the circle of his navel proceeded a light resembling that of the moon’s 
disk. When he grew up, the brahmins seated him in a carriage and took him about, 
proclaiming that whoever stroked his body would receive power and glory. By this 
means they earned much money. One day, in Sāvatthi, a dispute arose between the 
brahmins and the Buddha’s followers as to Candābha’s supernatural powers, and 
finally they took him to the Buddha for him to settle the quarrel. As Candābha 
approached the Buddha, the light from his body disappeared and Candābha, 
thinking that this was owing to some charm, asked to be taught the same. The 
Buddha stipulated that he should join the Order. Having done so, Candābha was 
asked to meditate on the thirty-two constituent parts of the Body. Soon 
afterwards he became an arahant.</p>
<p>In a previous birth he was a forester 
and formed a friendship with a merchant to whom he supplied red sandalwood. One 
day, when he visited the merchant in the town, he was taken by him to the place 
where a shrine was being erected over the remains of Kassapa Buddha. The 
forester, making a moon-disk from sandalwood, placed it within the shrine. After 
death, for a whole Buddha-interval, he was in Tāvatimsa and was known as the 
deva Candābha. DhA.iv.187ff; the SNA. version (ii.523ff) differs from this in 
several details.</p>
