<p>Once a country squire, having great 
faith in the holiness of a matted-haired ascetic, buried some of his wealth in 
the hermitage he himself had provided for the ascetic. The latter, coveting the 
gold, hid it elsewhere, and took leave of the squire as though he were going to 
some other part of the country. The squire, after pressing him in vain to stay, 
accompanied him part of the way. Suddenly the ascetic stopped and said he had 
found a straw from the roof of the hermitage sticking to his hair and wished to 
restore it as it did not belong to him. The squire was greatly impressed by this 
show of non-covetousness, but another ascetic, who was the Bodhisatta, observing 
what happened and guessing the reason, communicated his suspicions to the 
squire. When they searched for the gold it could not be found, but the ascetic 
confessed his guilt after a sound thrashing (J.i.375ff).</p>
<p>The occasion for the telling of the 
story is given in the Udd훮la J훮taka. </p>
