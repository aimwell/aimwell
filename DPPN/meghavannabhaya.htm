<p><b>1. Meghavannābhaya.</b> Another name for King 
Gothakābhaya (q.v.).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Meghavannābhaya. </b>A minister of King Mahāsena. He 
was an intimate friend of the king, but when the latter attempted to destroy the 
Mahāvihāra, he showed his displeasure by raising a revolt in Malaya. The king 
went out to fight him and pitched his camp near Dūratissavāpi. During the night, 
Meghavannābhaya visited the king alone, taking some delicacies which he had 
obtained, wishing to share them with him. At their meeting they begged each 
other’s forgiveness, and, with the king’s help, Meghavannābhaya restored the 
Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.17ff). According to the Smantapāsādikā (Sp.i.102; also 
SadS.43), one of the parivenas built by Meghavannābhaya seems to have borne his 
name. It was built on the site where, in the time of Devānampiyatissa, a recital 
of the Dhamma was held under the presidency of the Thera Mahā Arittha.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Meghavannābhaya vihāra</b>. A monastery founded by King

distributed six garments each to thirty thousand monks. Mhv.xxxvi.108.</p>
