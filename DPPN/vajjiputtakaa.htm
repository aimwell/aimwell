  <h2>Vajjiputtakā, Vajjiputtiyā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name of a large group of monks belonging to the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajjian</a> clan and dwelling in 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, who, one century after the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha’s</a> death, 
brought forward Ten Points (dasa vatthūni) as being permissible for members of 
the Order. These points are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) The storing of salt in a horn (singilonakappa);
  </li>
  <li>(2) the eating of food when the shadow of the sun had 
  passed two fingers' breadth beyond noon (duvangulakappa); </li>
  <li>(3) to eat once and then go again to the village for 
  alms (gāmantarakappa); </li>
  <li>(4) the holding of the uposatha separately by monks 
  dwelling in the same district (āvāsakappa); </li>
  <li>(5) the carrying out of an official act when the 
  assembly is incomplete (anumatikappa); </li>
  <li>(6) the following of a practice because it is so done 
  by one’s tutor or teacher (ācinnakappa); </li>
  <li>(7) the eating of sour milk by one who has already had 
  his midday meal (amathitakappa); </li>
  <li>(8) the use of strong drink before it has fermented (jalogikappa);
  </li>
  <li>(9) the use of a rug which is not of the proper size (nisīdanakappa);
  </li>
  <li>(10) the use of gold and silver (jātarūparajatakappa).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The orthodox monks refused to agree to these points, and 
one of their leaders, <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa Kākandakaputta</a>, publicly condemned the action of the 
Vajjiputtakas. Yasa then left <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>, and, having summoned monks from
<a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a> in 
the west and <a href="avanti.htm" title="ay/avanti.htm">Avanti</a> in the south, sought 
<a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta Sānavāsi</a> in 
<a href="ahogangaa.htm" title="am/ahogangaa.htm">Ahoganga</a>. On his 
advice they sought <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Soreyya-Revata</a>, and together they consulted 
<a href="sabbakama.htm" title="sa/sabbakama.htm">Sabbakāmi</a> at 
<a href="vaalikaaraama.htm" title="va/vaalikaaraama.htm">Vālikārāma</a>. In the Council that followed the Ten Points were declared invalid, 
and this decision was conveyed to the monks. Soon after was held a recital of 
the Doctrine in which seven hundred monks took part under the leadership of 
<a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Soreyya-Revata</a>. The recital lasted eight months.</p>
<p>The story of the Vajjiputtaka heresy is given in the 
twelfth chapter of the <a href="cuula_vagga.htm" title="c/cuula_vagga.htm">Cullavagga</a> (Vin.ii.294ff.); the Mhv.iv.9ff. gives more 
details in certain respects; see also Dpv.iv.48ff.; v.17ff.; 32ff. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that even during the Buddha’s life five 
hundred monks, described as Vajjiputtakā, seceded from the Order and joined 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> though they were later brought back by <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> 
(Vin.ii.199f.). <a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> actually (Sp.i.228) identifies the heretics as 
belonging to the same party. For the part played by Yasa Thera see 
<a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa (2).</a></p>
<p>The Vajjiputtakas refused to accept the finding of 
Revata’s Council and formed a separate sect, the 
<a href="mahasanghika.htm" title="maha/mahasanghika.htm">Mahāsanghikas</a>, numbering ten 
thousand monks, who held a recital of their own.</p>
