  <h2>Ucchitthabhatta Jātaka (No. 212)</h2>

<p>In a village near Kāsī, a brahmin’s 
wicked wife received her lover when her husband was away. She prepared a meal 
for her lover and while he ate she stood at the door watching for her husband. 
The brahmin appearing before he was expected, the lover was bundled into the 
store-room. The woman put some hot rice over the food left unfinished by her 
lover and gave the plate to her husband. When asked why the rice was hot on the 
top and cold at the bottom, she remained silent. The Bodhisatta, who had been 
born as a poor acrobat, had been at the door of the house waiting for alms and 
had seen all that had happened. He informed the brahmin of his wife’s conduct 
and both wife and lover received a sound beating.</p>
<p>The story was told to a monk who 
hankered after his wife. The Buddha related the story in order to show him that 
in a past birth this same wife had made him eat the leavings of her paramour.
