  <h2>Dhammapadatthakathā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentary on the Dhammapada, 
containing stories similar to those of the Jātakas and explaining the occasions 
on which the Dhammapada-stanzas were uttered. </p>
<p>A considerable number of these stories 
are found in the Four Nikāyas and the Vinaya, and more than fifty are either 
directly derived from the Jātaka Commentary or are closely parallel to them.
</p>
<p>The work is usually ascribed to 
Buddhaghosa, and in the prelude to the book it is stated that he translated the 
work from Sinhalese at the request of a monk named Kumārakassapa. For a 
discussion see P.L.C., pp.95ff; and Law: Pāli Lit., pp.449ff.</p>
