<p><b>1. Bhikkhunī Sutta. </b>The same as Bhikkhu Sutta 
  (2), substituting “nun” for “monk.” S.ii.261.</p>

<p><b>2. Bhikkhunī Sutta. </b>Once a nun, being enamoured of Ānanda, sent a message 
asking him to visit her, saying that she was ill. Ānanda came and preached to 
her on the body, how food should be taken only to sustain it, how craving for 
food should be abandoned together with pride and desire for sexual relations. 
The nun was overcome with shame at her intended deception and, falling at 
Ānanda’s feet, begged his forgiveness. A.ii.144f.</p>
