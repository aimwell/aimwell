  <h2>Punnanadī Jātaka (No. 214)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once chaplain at the court of 
Brahmadatta, king of Benares. But the king, listening to his enemies, sent the 
Bodhisatta away from the court, and he dwelt in a village of Kāsi. Later, the 
king, remembering his chaplain’s goodness, composed a verse, wrote it on a leaf, 
and sent it to him, together with cooked crow’s flesh. The Bodhisatta understood 
the message and returned to the court.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the great wisdom of 
the Buddha. Ānanda is identified with the king (J.ii.173 5). The Jātaka derives 
its name from the first two words of the verse composed by the king.</p>
