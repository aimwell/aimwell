<p>One of the ten chief warriors of 
Dutthagāmani. His personal name was Abhaya. His father was the headman of the 
village Kitti in Rohana, and Theraputtābhaya, when sixteen, wielded a club 
thirty-eight inches round and sixteen cubits long. He was therefore sent to 
Kākavannatissa’s court. Abhaya’s father was a supporter of Mahāsumma and, having 
heard a discourse from him, became a Sotāpanna, entered the Order and soon 
afterwards became an arahant. His son, thereupon, came to be called 
Theraputtābhaya (Mhv.xxiii.2, 63ff). At the end of Dutthagāmani’s campaigns, 
Abhaya took leave of the king and joined the Order, became an arahant, and lived 
with five hundred other arahants (Mhv.xxvi.2). When Dutthagāmani lay on his 
deathbed Abhaya visited him and gladdened his heart by reminding him of the 
works of great merit he had done (Mhv.xxxii.48ff).</p>
<p>In a previous birth he had given 
milk-rice to monks, hence his great strength (MT.453).</p>
