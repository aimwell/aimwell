  <h2>Sālaka Jātaka (No. 249)</h2>

<p>A snake charmer had a monkey called Sālaka, whom he 
trained to play with a snake; by this means the man earned his living. During a 
feast he entrusted the monkey to his friend, the Bodhisatta born as a merchant, 
and when he returned seven days later he beat the monkey and took him away. When 
the man wais asleep the monkey broke away and refused to be enticed back by the 
man.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to an Elder who ill 
treated a novice ordained by him. Several times the novice returned to the lay 
life, but came back at the Elder’s request, but in the end he refused to be 
persuaded. The novice was the monkey. J.ii.266f.</p>
