<p>1. Kulasekhara.-A Cholian king of South 
India. He besieged the Pandyan king, Parakkama of Madhurā, and the latter sent 
for help to Parakkamabāhu I. of Ceylon. Parakkamabāhu sent an expeditionary 
force to South India under Lankāpura, but in the meantime the Pandyan king had 
been slain and his capital taken. The Sinhalese force, however, landed and 
carried on a prolonged campaign against Kulasekhara and his allies, who seem to 
have been numerous and powerful. Kulasekhara was defeated, and the Pandyan 
king’s son, Vira Pandu, was installed in Madhurā. The Cola prisoners taken in 
the war were brought to Ceylon and employed in the reconstruction of the Mahā 
Thūpa in Anurādhapura. For details of this war see Cv.lxxvi, and lxxvii. For 
Kulasekhara’s later history see Cv.Trs.ii.100, n.1.</p>
<p>2. Kulasekhara.-A Pandu king. His 
general Ariyacakkavatti invaded Ceylon in the reign of Bhuvanekabāhu I. and 
carried off the Tooth Relic and other treasures. Later Parakkamabāhu III, 
visited Kulasekhara and retrieved the Tooth Relic. Cv.xc.47; 53f</p>
