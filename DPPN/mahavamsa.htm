<h2>Mahāvamsa</h2>
<p>The great Chronicle of Ceylon. The first part of the work
-&nbsp; i.e., to the time of King Mahāsena — 
is attributed to Mahānāma Thera (MT.687). The continuation of the Chronicle is 
called the Cūlavamsa. The first portion of the Cūlavamsa — 
i.e., from Mahāsena to the reign of Parakkamabāhu II. — 
is traditionally ascribed to a thera named Dhammarakkhita (Cv. Trs.ii.155, n.3). 
The next section — i.e., to the time of 
Kittisiri Rājasīha — was written by Tibbatuvāve Thera, Mahānāyaka of Pupphārāma, 
at the invitation of the king, who obtained for him copies of the Chronicle from 
Siam (Cv.xcix.78f; Cv.Trs.ii.263, n.1). From there it was continued till the 
time of the British occupation (1815 A.C.) by Hikkaduve Sumangala Thera 
(P.L.C.310).</p>
<p>There is a Commentary on the Mahāvamsa called the 
Vamsatthappakāsinī (q.v.).</p>
