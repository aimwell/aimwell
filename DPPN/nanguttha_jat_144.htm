<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family in the 
North Country, and on the day of his birth his parents lit for him a sacrificial 
fire. When he grew up, family life having no attractions for him, he took the 
fire to a hermitage in the forest and there tended it. One day he was given a 
cow in lieu of fee, sad, wishing to sacrifice it to the Lord of Fire, he left it 
by the fire and went to the village in search of salt. When he returned he found 
that thieves had eaten the cow, leaving only the hide and the tail. Disgusted 
that the Lord of Fire could not even guard his own possessions, he put out the 
fire and became a recluse.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a question as to 
whether the <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ajivikas</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp; some of whom lived behind 
<a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
obtained any merit through the practice of their difficult penances. J.i.493ff.</p>
