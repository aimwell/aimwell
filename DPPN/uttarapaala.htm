<p>A thera. He was the son of a brahmin in 
Sāvatthi. When he had attained to years of discretion he saw the Twin Miracle 
and entered the Order. One day, amid desultory recollection, he was beset by 
sensual desires, but after a violent mental struggle, he arrested his evil 
thoughts and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he had 
made a bridge for the Buddha to cross (Thag.252-4; ThagA.i.371f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with 
Setudāyaka of the Apadāna (ii.408).</p>
