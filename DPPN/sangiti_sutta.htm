<p>The thirty third sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya (D.iii.207ff), 
preached at Ubbhataka, the new Mote Hall of the Mallas of Pāvā. They had invited 
the Buddha to consecrate it by preaching there, and this he did until late into 
the night. Then, seeing that his audience wished for more, he asked Sāriputta to 
continue the preaching while he himself rested. Sāriputta therefore preached the 
Sangīti Sutta, at the end of which the Buddha expressed his great appreciation 
of Sāriputta’s exposition.</p>
<p>This sutta, like the Dasuttara, is arranged in a new plan
-&nbsp; which is regularly followed in the Anguttara 
Nikāya&nbsp;&nbsp; of grouping the points or chief items brought forward, 
numerically, in arithmetical progression — in this case 1 to 10. This scheme is 
a kind of thematic index to the doctrines scattered through the Four Nikāyas.</p>
<p>The Sarvāstivādins held this Sutta in high esteem, and 
included it (under the name of Sangītipariyāya) among the seven books 
constituting their Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Tibetan recensions attribute the Sutta 
to Mahā Kotthita. See Takākusu’s article on the Sarvāstivādins (J.P.T.S. 1904 
5).</p>
<p>The sutta treats of the dasadhammā (or ten conditions) in 
much the same way as the Puggala-Paññatti deals with the dasapuggalā (ten 
individuals).</p>
