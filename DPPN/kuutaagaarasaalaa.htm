<p>A hall in the Mahāvana near Vesāli. The 
Buddha stayed there on several occasions, and in the books are found records of 
various eminent persons who visited him there and of his conversations with 
them. Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Mahāli 
Otthatthaddha (D.i.150ff; S.i.230f; iii.68f; A.v.86f; several visits of Mahāli 
are mentioned; for details see Mahāli. BuA. p.3 mentions that the Buddha spent 
his sixth rainy season in the Kūtāgārasālā), Nandaka (S.v.389), Sunakkhatta 
(M.ii.252), Bhaddiya (A.ii.190f), Sālha and Abhaya (A.ii.200), all attended by 
numerous retinues; their senāpati, Sīha, who went with five hundred chariots, 
having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha (A iii.38f; iv.79, 
179ff); the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as 
described in the Cūla- and the Mahā-Saccaka Suttas (M.i.227ff; 237ff; the 
Licchavi Dummukha is also mentioned, M.i.234, as having been present when 
Saccaka argued with the Buddha); the householder Ugga of Vesāli, acclaimed by 
the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (A.iii.49; iv.208f; 
S.iv.109); the upāsaka Vāsettha (A.iv.258f), the two goddesses, daughters of 
Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadā (S.i.29f ); and the brahmin Pingiyāni 
(A.iii.237f).</p>
<p>The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and 
ministered to him during his stay in the Kūtāgārasālā, and it is said that they 
were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc. And Pingiyānī, seeing the 
Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha’s 
praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper 
garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha (A.iii.239f). On 
one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six 
spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks' 
concentration, but failed to achieve his object (S.i.112). Several Jātakas were 
related by the Buddha in the Kūtāgārasālā: the Sigāla (J.ii.5), the Telovāda 
(J.ii.262), the Bāhiya (J.i.420), and the Ekapanna (J.i.504). It was here that 
the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, 
led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed 
the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (A.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f; J.ii.392). The 
Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine 
(A.iv.280). It was also at the Kūtāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy 
as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis (S.ii.267f).</p>
<p>It was customary for the Buddha, when 
staying at the Kūtāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside 
the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if 
their desire to see him was insistent (see, e.g., D.i.151; A.iii.75), seek him 
there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no 
one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.</p>
<p>On one occasion the retreat lasted a 
fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed 
suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on 
the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and 
asked them to concentrate on breathing (S.v.320f). Sometimes the Buddha would 
walk from the Kūtāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood&nbsp; — e.g., 
the Sārandada-cetiya (A.iii.167) and the Cāpāla-cetiya (S.v.258; A.iv.308f). It 
was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last 
time on Vesāli. He then returned to the Kūtāgārasālā, where he announced that 
his death would take place within three months (D.ii.119f; S.v.258ff).</p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.310; 
MA.i.450), there was a monastery (sanghārāma) built for the monks in the 
Mahāvana. Part of it consisted of a storeyed house, with a hall below surrounded 
only by pillars. These pillars held the gabled room which formed the main part 
of the Buddha’s Gandha-kuti there. The hall lay from north to south and faced 
east (DA.i.311), and from this hall the whole monastery came to be known as the 
Kūtāgārasālā. There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha 
would often visit the patients and talk with them (E.g., S.iv.210f; A.iii.142).</p>
<p>The books also contain the names of 
others who stayed at the Kūtāgārasālā when the Buddha was in residence — e.g., 
Ānanda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāra 
(A.i.220); Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut (S.iii.116; iv.380); 
Nāgita, the Buddha’s former attendant, and Nāgita’s nephew the novice Sīha 
(D.i.151); also Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata, and Katissaha, all of 
whom left the Kūtāgārasālā and retired to the Gosingasālavana, when the visits 
of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude (A.v.133f).</p>
<p>In later times Yasa Kākandakaputta is 
mentioned as having stayed there (Sp.i.34; Mhv.iv.12; Dpv.v.29).</p>
<p>Eighteen thousand monks under Mahā-Buddharakkhita 
went from the monastery in Mahāvana in Vesāli to the foundation ceremony of the 
Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.33).</p>
<p>According to the Northern books 
(Dvy.136, 200; AvS.8; Mtu.i.300), the Kūtāgārasālā was on the banks of the lake 
Markatā (Markatahradatīre).</p>
