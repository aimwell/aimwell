<p>2. Kālavela.-A servant of Dīghagāmani.. 
He refused to promise the brothers of Ummādacittā that he would kill her if she 
gave birth to a boy, and so he was killed by them and reborn as a yakkha 
(Mhv.ix.22f). Later he saved the life of this boy, Pandukābhaya, who was being 
carried in a basket (Mhv.x.4), and when Pandukābhaya came to the throne, he 
founded a settlement for Kāladeva to the east of Anurādhapura (Mhv.vs.84). It is 
said that on feast days the yakkha appeared in visible form in company with 
Pandukābhaya (Mhv.vs104). </p>
<p>Mahāsena afterwards built a thūpa on the 
site of Kālavela’s shrine. Mhv.xxxvii.44.</p>
