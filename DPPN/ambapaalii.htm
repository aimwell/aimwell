</ul>
<p>A courtesan of <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>.  </p>
<p>She is said to 
have come spontaneously into being at Vesāli in the gardens of the king. The 
gardener found her at the foot of a mango tree — hence her name — and brought 
her to the city. She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young 
princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand. Finally, in order to 
end their strife, they appointed her courtesan. Later she became a devout 
follower of the Buddha, and building a vihāra in her own garden, gave it to him 
and the Order. This was during the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli shortly before 
his death. It is said that when Ambapālī heard of the Buddha’s visit to Kotigāma 
near Vesāli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to 
meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal 
the next day. The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to 
refuse that of the <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavis</a> of Vesāli.</p>
<p>While returning from her visit to the 
Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the 
next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on 
their way to the Buddha. She refused to give up her invitation for anything in 
the world. The DA. says that just before Ambapālī’s visit to him, the Buddha 
admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their 
heads about her (DA.ii.545).</p>
<p>It was after this meal that Ambapālī 
gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha 
accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva. 
Vin.i.231-3; D.ii.95-8; the two accounts vary in details, e.g. in the Digha 
version the Buddha was already in Ambapālivana, and not in Kotigāma, when the 
courtesan visited him.</p>
<p>Ambapālī had a son, <a href="vimalakondanna_thera.htm" title="vy/vimalakondanna_thera.htm">Vimala-Kondañña</a>, who 
was an eminent Elder. Having heard him preach one day, she renounced the world 
and, working for insight by studying the law of impermanence as illustrated in 
her own ageing body, she attained arahantship (ThigA.206-7).</p>
<p>Nineteen verses ascribed to her are 
found in the Therīgāthā (252-70).</p>
<p>In the time of <a href="sikhii.htm" title="s/sikhii.htm">Sikhī Buddha</a> she had 
entered the Order. While yet a novice, she took part in a procession of 
Bhikkhunīs, and was doing homage at a shrine when an arahant Therī in front of 
her hastily spat in the court of the shrine. Seeing the spittle and not knowing 
who had committed the fault, she said in reproof, “What prostitute has been 
spitting here?” It was owing to this remark that she was born as a courtesan in 
her last birth (ThigA.206-7).</p>
<p>The Apadāna (quoted also in ThigA) gives 
some more details about her. She had been a daughter of a Khattiya family in the 
time of Phussa Buddha and had done many good deeds in order to be beautiful in 
later births. As a result of the abuse of the nun (referred to above) she had 
been born in hell and later had, for ten thousand lives, been a courtesan. In 
Kassapa Buddha’s time she had practised celibacy (Ap.ii.613ff. ; ThigA.213f).</p>
<p>It is said that she charged fifty 
kahāpanas a night from her patrons and that Vesāli became very prosperous 
through her. It was this that prompted Bimbisāra to get a courtesan for his own 
city of Rājagaha (Vin.i.268).</p>
<p>Among Ambapālī’s patrons was <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>, 
and he was the father of her son Vimala-Kondañña (ThagA.i.146).</p>
<p>In the Theragāthā (vv.1020-21; 
ThagA.ii.129) there are two verses which, according to tradition, were spoken by 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> in admonition of monks who lost their heads at the sight of Ambapālī. 
Whether this was before or after she joined the Order we are not told.</p>
