<p>The story of a slave-woman of Sāvatthi. 
Her master heard the Buddha preach, and gave alms every day to four monks. She 
was entrusted with this duty, which she discharged conscientiously. For sixteen 
years she observed the sīlas, and one day, after listening to the Dhamma, she 
became a Sotāpanna. After death, she was born as one of Sakka’s companions and 
met Moggallāna, to whom she related her story. Vv.ii.1; VvA.91ff.</p>
