<p>Once the Bodhisatta was the sprite of a nimba tree in a 
cemetery, and one day, when a robber with stolen goods came in front of the 
tree, he drove him off, lest he should be discovered and impaled on a stake from 
the tree. When the king’s officials came to find the robber, he had disappeared, 
and they went away. Nearby was a bodhi tree whose sprite was Sāriputta.</p>
<p>The story was related to Moggallāna, who saw a man lurking 
near his cell, and, feeling suspicious, drove him away. Later, his suspicions 
were confirmed by the arrival of the kings men. J.iii.33 ff.</p>
