<p>The Bodhisatta was once a drummer, and having gone one 
day, with his son, to a great festival where he had earned much money, was 
returning through a forest infested by robbers. The boy kept on beating the 
drum, though his father tried to stop him, saying, “Beat it only now and again, 
as if some great lord were passing by.” At first the robbers were seared away, 
but they soon discovered that the two were alone and robbed them of their money.</p>
<p>The story was told to a self willed monk who is identified 
with the youth of the story. J.i.283-4.</p>
