<p>A grove near Vera침j캐 where the Buddha spent part of his 
time on his visit to Nera침j캐 (Vin.iii.1; A.iv.172, 197).  </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> explains 
(Sp.i.108) that the chief tree to be found there was a pucimanda or nimba tree 
at the foot of which was a shrine dedicated to a Yakkha named Naleru. The tree 
was shady and beautiful to look upon.  </p>
<p>The road northwards (to Uttarakuru?) went 
past this tree (Ibid.,184).</p>
