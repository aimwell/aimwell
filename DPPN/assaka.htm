<p><b>1. Assaka.</b>-A king mentioned in the <a href="nimi_jat_541.htm">Nimi Jātaka</a>, in a list of kings, such as Dudīpa, Sāgara, Sela, etc., who, in spite of 
all their great sacrifices, were not able to go beyond the Peta-world. J.vi.99.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Assaka.</b>-King of <a href="potali.htm" title="pu/potali.htm">Potali</a> in the kingdom 
of <a href="kaasi.htm" title="ka/kaasi.htm">Kāsi</a>. His queen consort 
<a href="ubbarii.htm" title="u/ubbarii.htm">Ubbarī</a> was very dear to him, and when she died he was 
plunged into grief. He put her corpse in a coffin, placed it under his bed and 
lay thereon, starving for seven days. The Bodhisatta was then an ascetic in the 
Himālaya, and just at this time he visited Potali. There, in the royal park, the 
king came to see him because he was told that the ascetic would show him Ubbarī. 
The Bodhisatta showed him Ubbarī now reborn as a dung-worm in the park, because, 
being intoxicated with her own beauty, she had done no good deeds. Seeing the 
king incredulous, the ascetic made her speak, and she declared that she cared 
much more for the dung-worm, who was now her mate, than for Assaka who had been 
her husband in her previous life. Assaka went back to the palace, had the body 
disposed of, married another queen and lived righteously. J.ii.155-8.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Assaka.</b>-King of Potanagara in the 
Assaka country, soon after the Buddha’s death. He was the father of Sujāta and 
had two wives. He bequeathed his kingdom to the son of the younger wife 
(VvA.259-60).</p>
<p>See also <a href="aruna.htm" title="ay/aruna.htm">Aruna</a> (2).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Assaka.</b>-The country of Assaka is one 
of the sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a> mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.213; iv.252, 
256, 260). It does not, however; occur in the list of twelve countries given in 
the <a href="janavasabha.htm" title="j/janavasabha.htm">Janavasabha Sutta</a>. The Assakas are said to have had settlements on the 
Godāvarī, and Bāvarī’s hermitage (Sn.v.977) was in their territory, in close 
proximity to the Alaka or Mulaka (the district round Paithan) (Law, Early 
Geography, 21).</p>
<p>The country is mentioned with Avanti 
(J.v.317) in the same way as Anga with Magadha, and its position in the list 
between Sūrasena and Avanti makes it probable that when the list was drawn up, 
its position was immediately to the north-west of Avanti. It is probable, in 
that case, that the Godāvarī settlement, in the Dakkhināpatha, was a later 
colony.</p>
<p>In the Assaka Jātaka (J.ii.155) mention 
is made of a king Assaka whose realm was in the kingdom of Kāsī. It is 
significant, in this connection, that the capital of Assaka, variously called 
Potana (E.g., D.ii.235; J.iii.3) or Potali (E.g., J.ii.155), is not mentioned in 
the reference to the Godāvarī.</p>
<p>According to the Culla Kālinga Jātaka 
(J.iii.3-5), at one time the King of Assaka (Arum) accepted the challenge of 
King Kālinga of Dantapura to war, and defeated him. Later Assaka married 
Kālinga’s daughter and the relations between the two countries were amicable. In 
the Hāthigumphā Inscription of Khāravela it is related that Khāravela, 
regardless of King Sātakarnī, sent a large army to the west (pachime disam) to 
strike terror into Assaka (or Asika) nagara. Law (Op.cit., p.21) thinks that the 
Assaka of the Culla Kālinga Jātaka, the Asikanagara of the Hāthigumphā 
Inscription and the Assaka of the Sutta Nipāta are one and the same place. This 
would probably be correct if Potana and Potali were regarded as two different 
cities, capitals of two different settlements having the same name.</p>
<p>Sanskrit authors speak of both Asmakā 
and Asvakā. It is not possible to say whether these represent two distinct 
tribes or whether they are variant names for the same people. Asanga mentions 
Asmaka in his Sūtrālankāra as a territory on the basin of the Indus. This would 
make it identical with the Assakenus of Greek writers, that is to the east of 
the Sarasvati, about twenty-five miles from the sea on the Swat valley. Pānini 
mentions the Asmakas (iv.173). The Mārkandeya Purāna and the Brhat Samhitā place 
Assaka to the north-west. The Assaka capital, Potana, it has been suggested, is 
the Paudanya of the Mahābhārata (i.77, 47). In the Commentary to Kautilya’s 
Arthasāsta, Bhattasvāmi identifies Asmaka with Mahārāstra (Law, op. cit., 22).</p>
<p>Soon after the Buddha’s death, a King 
Assaka was the ruler of Potali, and he and his son Sūjata were converted by Mahā 
Kaccānā (VvA.259-67).</p>
<p>In the time of King Renu, the Assaka 
king of Potana was Brahmadatta (D.ii.236).</p>
<p>In the Buddha’s time the Assaka king is 
described as an Andhakarājā. He took a thousand for the plot of land sold for 
Bāvarī’s hermitage (SnA.ii.581).</p>
