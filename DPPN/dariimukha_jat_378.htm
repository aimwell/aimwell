<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as 
Brahmadatta, son of the king of Magadha. He studied at Takkasilā with his friend 
Darīmukha, son of the king’s purohita. Once, while travelling, they came to 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and there, while resting in the king’s garden, Brahmadatta fell asleep 
and Darīmukha, who perceived certain omens which foretold kingship for his 
friend, left him, and having become a Pacceka Buddha, retired to Nandamūlaguhā. 
Brahmadatta became king of Benares and, in his glory, forgot Darīmukha for many, 
many years. When fifty years had passed Darīmukha visited the king and preached 
to him on Renunciation. Later, Brahmadatta also became an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the Buddha’s Renunciation. J.iii.238-46.</p>
