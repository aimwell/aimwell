<p>One of the three daughters of Māra, the 
others being Tanhā and Ragā. (In the Buddha-Carita (xiii.), their names are Ratī, 
Prītī and Trsnā; in the Lal. (353), Ratī, Aratī and Trsnā). </p>
<p>Seeing their father disconsolate after 
his repeated attempts to foil Gotama’s quest for Enlightenment, they offered to 
tempt the Buddha with their wiles. This was in the fifth week after the 
Enlightenment. With Māra’s approval, they came to the Buddha in various forms 
and in various guises, as he sat at the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, and 
danced and sang before him. In the end the Buddha told them that he was beyond 
temptation by the pleasures of the senses and they went back to their father 
(S.i.124-7; J.i.78-80, 469; DhA.i.201f., iii.196,199; SN.v.835).</p>
<p>In the Samyutta account, they are said 
to have asked the Buddha questions regarding himself and his teachings. Aratī’s 
question was how a man who had already crossed the five floods could cross the 
sixth. For explanation see KS.i.158, n.3.</p>
