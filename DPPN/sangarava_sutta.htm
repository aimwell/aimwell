<p><b>1. Sangārava Sutta.</b> The 100th Sutta of the Majjhima 
Nikāya. It contains an account of the discussion between the Buddha and 
Sangārava brāhmana of Candalakappa. See Sangārava. 
M.ii.209ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sangārava Sutta.</b> An account of the visit of the 
Buddha and Ānanda to Sangārava brāhmana of Sāvatthi. Sangārava explains to the 
Buddha that he washes away his faults by bathing morning and evening. The Buddha 
says that the only true purification is through the Dhamma. S.i.182f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sangārava Sutta.</b> The Buddha 
explains to Sangārava that mantras learnt at a time when the heart is possessed 
by sensual lust, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and flurry, doubt and 
wavering, are easily forgotten; as is the case of a man who tries to see his 
reflection in a bowl of water, either mixed with some dye, or heated on the 
fire, or overspread with mossy grass, or ruffled by the wind, or muddied and set 
in the dark. The cultivation of the seven bojjhanga will remove these 
disadvantages. S.v.121ff.; cf. No. 5 below.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sangārava Sutta. </b>Sangārava visits the Buddha and 
states that a brahmin is of more use than a Paribbājaka because he not only 
performs sacrifices himself, but makes others do likewise. The Buddha says that 
the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world is of benefit to many beings. Ānanda 
asks Sangārava which of the two practices appears to him the simpler and of 
greater profit. Sangārava evades a straight answer, even though asked three 
times. The Buddha then tells him of the marvels of iddhi, ādesanā and anusāsanā 
possessed by monks, and describes them in detail. Sangārava admits that the 
ādesanā pātihāriya appeals moist to him. The Buddha tells him that numerous 
monks in the Order possess all three marvels. A.i.168ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sangārava Sutta. </b>Sangārava visits the Buddha and 
questions him on the power of remembering mantras. Same as No. 3 above.&nbsp; 
A.iii.230f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sangārava Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells Sangārava, in 
answer to a question, that wrong view, wrong thinking, speech, action, living, 
effort, mindfulness, concentration, knowledge and release, are the “hither 
shore” and their opposites the “further shore.” A.v.232f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sangārava Sutta.</b> The Buddha tells Sangārava that 
taking life, theft, wrong sexual conduct, falsehood, spiteful and bitter speech, 
idle babble, coveting, harmfulness, wrong view, are the “hither shore” and 
abstention from these is the “further shore.” A.v.252f.</p>
