<p>The Bodhisatta was once a conch-blower. He went with his 
father to a public festival, where they earned a great deal of money. On their 
way through a forest infested with robbers, the son warned his father not to 
blow on his conch shell, but his father persisted, and they were plundered by 
the robbers.</p>
<p>The story was told to a self willed monk who is identified 
with the father. J.i.284.</p>
