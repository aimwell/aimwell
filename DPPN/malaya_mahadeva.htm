<p>An arahant. During the Akkhakkhāyika famine, Dutthagāmanī 
provided him and four others with a dish of sour millet gruel, which was 
purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the king’s earrings (Mhv.xxxii.30). 
Mahādeva took his portion to Sumanakūta and shared it with nine hundred others 
(Mhv.xxxii.49). He was also among the eight arahants who accepted a meal of pork 
from Sāliya in his previous birth as a blacksmith (MT.606). He was probably so 
called because he lived at Kotapabbata in the Malaya country. MT.606 he is 
called Kotapabbatavāsika.</p>
<p>It is said that for three years after his ordination 
Mahādeva lived in the Maindalārāmaka vihāra (Mahādeva called Maliyadeva in the 
context (AA.i.22), but further on in the same passage (p.23) he is addressed as 
Mahādeva). One day, while going for alms in Kallagāma, near by, he was invited 
by an upāsikā to her dwelling, where she gave him a meal, and, regarding him as 
a son, invited him to take all his meals at her home. The invitation was 
accepted, and each day, after the meal, he would return thanks with the words 
“May you be happy and free from sorrow” (sukham hotu, dukkhā mucca). At the end 
of the rainy season he became an arahant, and the chief incumbent of the Vihāra 
entrusted him with the task of preaching to the assembled people on the Pavārana 
Day. The young novices informed the upāsikā that her “son” would preach that 
day, but she, thinking they were making fun of her, said that not everyone could 
preach. But they persuaded her to go to the vihāra, and, when the turn of 
Maliyadeva came, he preached all through the night. At dawn he stopped, and the 
upāsikā became a sotāpanna.</p>
<p>Maliyadeva once preached the Cha Chakka Sutta in the 
Lohāpāsāda, and sixty monks, who listened to him, became arahants. He also 
preached the same sutta in the Mahāmandapa, in the Mahāvihāra, at Cetīyapabbata, 
at Sākyavamsa vihāra, at Kutāli vihāra, at Antara-sobbha, Mutingana, 
Vātakapabbata, Pācīnagharaka, Dīghavāpī, Lokandara, and Gamendavāla, and, at 
each place, sixty monks attained arahantship. At Cittalapabbata he saw a monk of 
over sixty preparing to bathe at Kuruvakatittha, and asked permission to bathe 
him. The Elder, discovering from his conversation that he was Maliyadeva, agreed 
to let him do so, though, he said, no one had ever touched his body during sixty 
years. Later in the day, the Elder begged Maliyadeva to preach to him, and this 
he did. Sixty monks, all over sixty, were among the audience, and at the 
conclusion of the Cha Chakka Sutta they all became arahants. The same thing 
happened at Tissamahāvihāra, Kalyāni vihāra, Nāgamahāvihara, Kalacchagāma, and 
at other places, sixty in all (MA.ii.1024f).</p>
<p>Malaya Mahādeva was among those various large groups who 
renounced the world in the company of the Bodhisatta: the Kuddālasamāgama, 
Mūgapakkha samāgama, Cūlasutasoma samāgama, Ayogharapandita samāgama and 
Hatthipāla samāgama (J.iv.490; also vi.30, where Mahāmaliyadeva is called 
Kālavelavāsī). It is said (Vsm.241) that two monks once asked Malaya Mahādeva 
for a subject of meditation, and that he gave them the formula of the thirty two 
parts of the body. Though versed in the three Nikāyas, the monks could not 
become sotāpannas until they had recited the formula for a period of four 
months.</p>
