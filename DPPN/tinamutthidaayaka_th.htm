<p>An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago he was a hunter. One day, seeing the Buddha Tissa (v.l. 
Upatissa) in the forest near Lambaka, he gave him a handful of grass for a seat. 
He was soon afterwards killed by a lion and was born in the deva-world 
(A.i.280f). The same story is given elsewhere (A.ii.454f) in somewhat different 
words.</p>
<p>This Elder is evidently to be identified 
with Posiya Thera. ThagA.i.97.</p>
