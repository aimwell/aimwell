<p>He was a brahmin of Rājagaha, who had become proficient in 
Vedic lore. Having become an ascetic, he dwelt in a forest glade, three leagues 
from Rājagaha, living on wild rice and worshipping fire. There the Buddha 
visited him and was entertained for three clays. The Buddha taught him the 
Doctrine, and the ascetic became a sotāpanna and, later, an arahant. He 
continued to live in the jungle, and the Buddha visited him again when he fell 
ill of cramp. Thag.vs.435 40; ThagA.i.459 f.</p>
