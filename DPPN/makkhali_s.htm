  <h2>Makkhali (or MicchƒÅditthika) 
  Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A man with perverted view leads many people away from 
righteousness and plants them in unrighteousness.</p>
<p>There is no other thing so greatly to be blamed as wrong 
view. Like a fish trap set at a river mouth is Makkhali, existing for the 
distress and destruction of many beings. He who urges adherence to a doctrine 
and discipline rightly expounded, he whom he thus urges, and he who, thus urged, 
walks therein accordingly, all alike beget much merit. A.i.33f.</p>
