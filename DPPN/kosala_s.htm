<p>1. Kosala Sutta.-While Pasenadi is 
visiting the Buddha, a messenger arrives and announces the death of Mallikā. The 
king is greatly grieved, but the Buddha consoles him by pointing out how it is 
impossible to escape old age, decay, disease, destruction. A.iii.57.</p>
<p>2. Kosala Sutta.-Everything changes, 
even Pasenadi, king of Kāsi-Kosala, the whole universe, even Mahā Brahmā and the 
devas of the Abhassara world. Instability and change are everywhere; therefore 
the wise loathe all, having a mind only to attain in this life the 
anupadāparinibbāna (A.v.59ff).</p>
<p>3. Kosala Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the 
Buddha at Jetavana after having won a battle, and, falling at the Buddha’s feet, 
shows great humility and does obeisance. When the Buddha asks the reason for 
such profound homage, the king gives various reasons for his honouring of the 
Buddha (A.v.65ff).</p>
