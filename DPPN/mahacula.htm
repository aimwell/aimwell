  <h2>Mahācūla (Cūlika ) Mahātissa</h2>

</ul>
<p>Son of Khallātanāga and Anulādevi. </p>
<p>Vattagāmani adopted him (thereby earning the title of 
Pitirājā) and took him with him when forced to flee from the Damilas 
(Mhv.xxxiii.35, 45; Dpv.xx.22f, 31). </p>
<p>Mahācūla succeeded Vattagāmani as king of Ceylon and ruled 
for fourteen years (17-3 B.C.). He worked in a rice 
field, disguised as a labourer, and with the wages so earned gave alms to 
Mahāsumma. For three years he laboured in a sugar mill near Sonnagiri and built 
the vihāras known as Mandavāpi, Abhayagallaka, Vankāvattakagalla, 
Dīghabāhugallaka, and Jālagāma. He was succeeded by Coranāga (Mhv.xxxiv.1ff). 
Mahācūla had two sons, Tissa (poisoned by the notorious Anulā) and 
Kutakannatissa. Mhv.xxxiv.15, 28.</p>
