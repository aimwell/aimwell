<p><b>1. Chattapāni.-</b>An upāsaka of Sāvatthi. 
He was an Anāgāmī according to the Jātaka account (J.i.381f.) and a Sakadāgāmi 
according to the DhA. (i.380f.).</p>
<p>Once, when listening to the Buddha’s 
teaching, he failed to notice and do reverence to the king, Pasenadi, who 
arrived during the discourse. Later, when summoned to the king’s palace, he went 
with every sign of respect and paid obeisance to the king. When asked why he had 
not so behaved on the previous occasion, Chattapāni replied that such an action 
would have been discourteous to the Buddha. Thereupon Pasenadi asked him to act 
as instructor in the Dhamma to the women of the palace, but he refused the 
invitation, deeming that such a course would be unseemly and unwise. The task 
was therefore given to Ānanda. DhA.i.380f; cp. Vin.iv.157. The story is also 
found in J.i.381f, with several variations in detail. There we are told that the 
Buddha, seeing that the king was displeased, made special mention to him of 
Chattapāni’s attainments.</p>

<p><b>2. Chattapāni.</b>-The barber of King Yasapāni. His story is related in the Dhammaddhaja Jātaka (q.v.). He had four 
virtues — he was free from envy, drank no intoxicants, had no strong desires and 
no wrath. In one of his previous lives he was a king whose queen carried on 
intrigues with sixty-four of the slaves. Having failed to tempt the Bodhisatta, 
she spoke calumny against him and had him put in prison. But he explained the 
matter to the king and was released. From that time the king gave up envy. In 
another birth he was a king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, strongly addicted to drinking and 
meat-eating; one day the meat prepared for him was eaten by the palace dogs. It 
was fast-day, and as there was no meat in the town the cook sought the queen’s 
advice. When the king sat down to eat, his small son, whom he much loved, was 
brought to him in the hope that he might forget to ask for meat. But the plan 
failed, and in his drunkenness he twisted his son’s neck and had his flesh 
cooked for him to eat. Thence-forth he refrained from strong drink and 
meat-eating.</p>
<p>Two other births of Chattapāni are 
mentioned, once as Kitavāsa and once as Araka (q.v.). He is identified with 
Sāriputta. J.ii.186-96.</p>
