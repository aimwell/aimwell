<p>The Buddha tells a householder, who is mourning for his 
son, that dear ones always bring sorrow and tribulation. The man, however, 
disagreed with this view and did not scruple to say so wherever he went. 
 
</p>
<p><a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> taunted
<a href="mallikaa.htm" title="ma/mallikaa.htm">Mallikā</a> with this, and she sent Nālijangha to the Buddha to ask 
if these were his words. The Buddha convinced him by means of various examples 
that the statement was true, and when this was reported to Mallikā, she was able 
to prove to Pasenadi that the Buddha’s teaching was in accordance with facts.
