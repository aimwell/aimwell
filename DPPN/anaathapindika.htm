  <h2>Anāthapindika</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A banker (setthi) of Sāvatthi who became 
famous because of his unparalleled generosity to the Buddha. His first meeting 
with the Buddha was during the first year after the Enlightenment, in Rājagaha 
(the story is given in Vin.ii.154ff; SA.i.240ff, etc.), whither Anāthapindika 
had come on business. </p>
<p>His wife was the sister of the setthi of 
Rājagaha, and when he arrived he found the setthi preparing a meal for the 
Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale that he thought that a wedding was 
in progress or that the king had been invited. On learning the truth he became 
eager to visit the Buddha, and did so very early the next morning 
(Vin.ii.155-6). He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up 
three times during the night. When, at last, he started for Sītavana, the road 
was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, Sīvaka, sped him on with words of 
encouragement. By force of his piety the darkness vanished.</p>
<p>The Buddha was staying in the Sītavana, 
and when Anāthapindika reached there spirits opened the door for him. He found 
the Buddha walking up and down, meditating in the cool air of the early dawn. 
The Buddha greeted him and talked to him on various aspects of his teaching. 
Anāthapindika was immediately converted and became a Sotāpanna. He invited the 
Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the setthi, 
the Mayor of Rājagaha and King Bimbisāra asked to be allowed to help. After the 
meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to 
spend the rainy season at Sāvatthi, and the Buddha accepted, saying “the 
Tathāgatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude.” “I understand, o Blessed 
One, I understand,” was the reply.</p>
<p>When Anāthapindika had finished his 
business at Rājagaha he set out towards Sāvatthi, giving orders along the way to 
his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts 
all along the road to Sāvatthi in preparation for the Buddha’s visit. He had 
many friends and acquaintances and he was ādeyyavaco (his word was held to be of 
weight), loc. cit., p.158. But see J.i.92, where it is said that Anāthapindika 
bore all the expenses of these preparations. Vihāras were built costing l,000 
pieces each, a yojana apart from each other.</p>
<p>Understanding the request implied in the 
Buddha’s words when he accepted the invitation, Anāthapindika looked out for a 
quiet spot near Sāvatthi where the Buddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye 
fell on the park of Jetakumāra. He bought the park at great expense and erected 
therein the famous Jetavanārāma. As a result of this and of his numerous other 
benefactions in the cause of the Sāsana, Anāthapindika came to be recognised as 
the chief of alms-givers (A.i.25).</p>
<p>Anāthapindika’s personal name was 
Sudatta, but he was always called Anāthapindika (AA.i.208; MA.i.50) (feeder of 
the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when 
the Buddha addressed him by his own name (Vin.ii.156). He spent eighteen crores 
on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the vihāra; 
another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication. He fed one 
hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, 
people of the village, invalids, etc. Five hundred seats were always ready in 
his house for any guests who might come (AA.i.208-9. He fed 1,000 monks daily 
says DhA.i.128; but see J.iii.119, where a monk, who had come from far away and 
had missed the meal hour, had to starve.).</p>
<p>Anāthapindika’s father was the setthi 
Sumana (AA. loc. cit). The name of Anāthapindika’s brother was Subhūti.</p>
<p>Anāthapindika married a lady called 
Puññalakkhanā (J.ii.410; J.iii.435, she was the sister of the setthi of 
Rājagaha. SA.i.240); he had a son Kāla and three daughters, Mahā-Subhaddā, 
Cūla-Subhaddā and Sumanā. (Besides Kāla, Anāthapindika had another son, who 
joined the Order under Subhūti Thera; AA.ii.865). Mention is also made of a 
daughter-in law, Sujātā by name, daughter of Dhanañjaya and the youngest sister 
of Visākhā. She was very haughty and ill-treated the servants (J.ii.347).</p>
<p>The son, in spite of his father’s 
efforts, showed no piety until he was finally bribed to go to the vihāra and 
listen to the Buddha’s preaching (see Kāla). The daughters, on the other hand, 
were most dutiful and helped their father in ministering to the monks. The two 
elder ones attained to the First Fruit of the Path, married, and went to live 
with the families of their husbands. Sumanā obtained the Second Fruit of the 
Path, but remained unmarried. Overwhelmed with disappointment because of her 
failure in finding a husband, she refused to eat and died; she was reborn in 
Tusita (DhA.i.128f).</p>
<p>The Bhadraghata Jātaka (J.ii.431) tells 
us of a nephew of Anāthapindika who squandered his inheritance of forty crores. 
His uncle gave him first one thousand and then another five hundred with which 
to trade. This also he squandered. Anāthapindika then gave him two garments. On 
applying for further help the man was taken by the neck and pushed out of doors. 
A little later he was found dead by a side wall.</p>
<p>The books also mention a girl, Punnā, 
who was a slave in Anāthapindika’s household. On one occasion when the Buddha 
was starting on one of his periodical tours from Jetavana, the king, 
Anāthapindika, and other eminent patrons failed to stop him; Punnā, however, 
succeeded, and in recognition of this service Anāthapindika adopted her as his 
daughter (MA.i.347-8). On uposatha days his whole household kept the fast; on 
all occasions they kept the pañcasīla inviolate (J.iii.257).</p>
<p>A story is told of one of his labourers 
who had forgotten the day and gone to work; but remembering later, he insisted 
on keeping the fast and died of starvation. He was reborn as a deva 
(MA.i.540-1).</p>
<p>Anāthapindika had a business village in 
Kāsi and the superintendent of the village had orders to feed any monks who came 
there (Vin.iv.162f). One of his servants bore the inauspicious name of Kālakanni 
(curse); he and the banker had been playmates as children, and Kālakanni, having 
fallen on evil days, entered the banker’s service. The latter’s friends 
protested against his having a man with so unfortunate a name in his household, 
but he refused to listen to them. One day when Anāthapindika was away from home 
on business, burglars came to rob his house, but Kālakanni with great presence 
of mind drove them away (J.i.364f).</p>
<p>A similar story is related of another 
friend of his who was also in his service (J.i.441).</p>
<p>All his servants, however, were not so 
intelligent. A slave woman of his, seeing that a fly had settled on her mother, 
hit her with a pestle in order to drive it away, and killed her (J.i.248f).</p>
<p>A slave girl of his borrowed an ornament 
from his wife and went with her companions to the pleasure garden. There she 
became friendly with a man who evidently desired to rob her of her ornaments. On 
discovering his intentions, she pushed him into a well and killed him with a 
stone (J.iii.435).</p>
<p>The story of Anāthapindika’s cowherd, 
Nanda, is given elsewhere.</p>
<p>All the banker’s friends were not 
virtuous; one of them kept a tavern (J.i.251). As a result of Anāthapindika’s 
selfless generosity he was gradually reduced to poverty. But he continued his 
gifts even when he had only bird-seed and sour gruel. The devata who dwelt over 
his gate appeared before him one night and warned him of his approaching penury; 
it is said that every time the Buddha or his monks came to the house she had to 
leave her abode over the gate and that this was inconvenient to her and caused 
her to be jealous. Anāthapindika paid no attention to her warnings and asked her 
to leave the house. She left with her children, but could find no other lodging 
and sought counsel from various gods, including Sakka. Sakka advised her to 
recover for Anāthapindika the eighteen crores that debtors owed him, another 
eighteen that lay in the bottom of the sea, and yet eighteen more lying 
unclaimed. She did so and was readmitted (DhA.iii.10ff; J.i.227ff).</p>
<p>Anāthapindika went regularly to see the 
Buddha twice a day, sometimes with many friends (J.i.95ff.; he went three times 
says J.i.226), and always taking with him alms for the young novices. But we are 
told that he never asked a question of the Buddha lest he should weary him. He 
did not wish the Buddha to feel obliged to preach to him in return for his 
munificence (DhA.i.3). But the Buddha of his own accord preached to him on 
various occasions; several such sermons are mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>on the importance of having a 
  well-guarded mind like a well-protected gable in a house (A.i.261f); 
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>on the benefits the recipient of food 
  obtains (life, beauty, happiness, strength); </li>
  <li>
  <p>on the four obligations that make up 
  the pious householder’s path of duty (gihisāmikiccāni — waiting on the Order 
  with robes, food, lodgings, medical requirements. Referred to also in S.v.387, 
  where Anāthapindika expresses his satisfaction that he had never failed in 
  these obligations); </li>
  <li>
  <p>on the four conditions of success that 
  are hard to win (wealth gotten by lawful means, good report, longevity, happy 
  rebirth); </li>
  <li>
  <p>on the four kinds of happiness which a 
  householder should seek (ownership, wealth, debtless ness, blamelessness) 
  (these various tetrads are given in A.ii.64ff).</li>
  <li>
  <p>on the five kinds of enjoyment which 
  result from wealth rightfully obtained (enjoyment — experienced by oneself and 
  by one’s friends and relations, security in times of need, ability to pay 
  taxes and to spend on one’s religion, the giving of alms to bring about a 
  happy rebirth, A.iii.45-6); </li>
  <li>
  <p>the five things which are very 
  desirable but difficult to obtain (long life, beauty, happiness, glory, good 
  condition of rebirths, A.iii.47-8); </li>
  <li>
  <p>the five sinful acts that justify a 
  man’s being called wicked (hurting of life, etc. A.iii.204); </li>
  <li>
  <p>the inadvisability of being satisfied 
  with providing requisites for monks without asking oneself if one also 
  experiences the joy that is born of ease of mind (evidently a gentle warning 
  to Anāthapindika, A.iii.206-7).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha preached the Velāma Sutta to 
encourage Anāthapindika when he had been reduced to poverty and felt 
disappointed that he could no longer provide luxuries for the monks 
(A.iv.392ff). On another occasion the Buddha tells Anāthapindika that the 
Sotāpanna is a happy man because he is free from various fears: fear of being 
born in hell, among beasts, in the realm of Peta or in some other unhappy state; 
he is assured of reaching Enlightenment (A.iv.405f, also S.v.387f).</p>
<p>Elsewhere the Buddha tells Anāthapindika 
that it is not every rich man who knows how to indulge in the pleasures of sense 
legitimately and profitably (A.v.177ff).</p>
<p>There is, however, at least one sutta 
preached as a result of a question put by Anāthapindika himself regarding gifts 
and those who are worthy to receive them (A.i.62-3); and we also find him 
consulting the Buddha regarding the marriage of his daughter, Cola Subhaddā 
(DhA.iii.466).</p>
<p>Anāthapindika died before the Buddha. As 
he lay grievously ill he sent a special message to Sāriputta asking him to come 
(again, probably, because he did not want to trouble the Buddha). Sāriputta went 
with Ānanda and preached to him the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta (M.iii.258f.; see 
also S.v.380-7, which contain accounts of incidents connected with this visit). 
His pains left him as he concentrated his mind on the virtuous life he had led 
and the many acts of piety he had done. Later he fed the Elders with food from 
his own cooking-pot, but quite soon afterwards he died and was born in the 
Tusita heaven. That same night he visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a 
song of praise of Jetavana and of Sāriputta who lived there, admonishing others 
to follow the Buddha’s teaching. In heaven he will live as long as Visākhā and 
Sakka (DA.iii.740). </p>
<p>Various incidents connected with 
Anāthapindika are to be found in the Jātakas. On one occasion his services were 
requisitioned to hold an inquiry on a bhikkhuni who had become pregnant 
(J.i.148).</p>
<p>Once when the Buddha went on tour from 
Jetavana, Anāthapindika was perturbed because there was no one left for him to 
worship; at the Buddha’s suggestion, an offshoot from the Bodhi tree at Gaya was 
planted at the entrance to Jetavana (J.iv.229).</p>
<p>Once a brahmin, hearing of 
Anāthapindika’s luck, comes to him in order to find out where this luck lay so 
that he may obtain it. The brahmin discovers that it lay in the comb of a white 
cock belonging to Anāthapindika; he asks for the cock and it is given to him, 
but the luck flies away elsewhere, settling first in a pillow, then in a jewel, 
a club, and, finally, in the head of Anāthapindika’s wife. The brahmin’s desire 
is thus frustrated (J.ii.410f).</p>
<p>On two occasions he was waylaid by 
rogues. Once they tried to make him drink drugged toddy. He was at first shocked 
by their impertinence, but, later, wishing to reform them, frightened them away 
(J.i.268).</p>
<p>On the other occasion, the robbers lay 
in wait for him as he returned from one of his villages; by hurrying back he 
escaped them (J.ii.413). Whenever Anāthapindika visited the Buddha, he was in 
the habit of relating to the Buddha various things which had come under his 
notice, and the Buddha would relate to him stories from the past containing 
similar incidents. Among the Jātakas so preached are: Apannaka, Khadirahgāra, 
Rohinī, Vārunī, Punnapāti, Kālakanni, Akataññū, Verī, Kusanāli, Siri, 
Bhadraghata, Visayha, Hiri, Sirikālakannī and Sulasā. </p>
<p>Anāthapindika was not only a shrewd 
business man but also a keen debater. The Anguttara Nikāya (A.v.185-9) records a 
visit he paid to the Paribbājakas when he could think of nothing better to do. A 
lively debate ensues regarding their views and the views of the Buddha as 
expounded by Anāthapindika. The latter silences his opponents. When the incident 
is reported to the Buddha, he speaks in high praise of Anāthapindika and 
expresses his admiration of the way in which he handled the discussion.</p>
<p>During the time of Padumattara Buddha 
Anāthapindika had been a householder of Hamsavatī. One day he heard the Buddha 
speak of a lay-disciple of his as being the chief of alms-givers. The 
householder resolved to be so designated himself in some future life and did 
many good deeds to that end. His wish was fulfilled in this present life. 
Anāthapindika is sometimes referred to as Mahā Anāthapindika to distinguish him 
from Cūla Anāthapindika.</p>
