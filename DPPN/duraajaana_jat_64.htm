<h2>Durājāna Jātaka (No.64)</h2>
<p>A young brahmin student of Takkasilā 
fell in love with a woman and married her. She was very capricious and her 
husband neglected his duties. The teacher instructed his student to take no 
notice of his wife’s moods.</p>
<p>The story was related to a devout layman 
of Sāvatthi who had as wife a capricious woman. She worried him so much that he 
neglected his visits to the Buddha. The couple were identical in both stories. 
J.i.299-301.</p>
