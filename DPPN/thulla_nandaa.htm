  <h2>Thulla-Nandā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A nun, one of four sisters who all 
joined the Order, the others being <a href="nandaa.htm" title="n/nandaa.htm">Nandā</a>, Nandavatī and 
<a href="sundari_nandaa.htm" title="s/sundari_nandaa.htm">Sundarinandā</a>. 
</p>
<p>Thulla-Nandā appears to have had charge 
of a large company of nuns, all of whom followed her in various malpractices 
(Vin.iv.211.239, 240, 280). </p>
<p>Thulla-Nandā was well-versed in the 
Doctrine and was a clever preacher. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, is mentioned as 
having come on two occasions to hear her preach, and was so pleased with her 
eloquence that he allowed her to persuade him to give her the costly upper 
garments he was wearing (Vin.iv.254-256). </p>
<p>She was greedy for possessions, and was 
later accused of misappropriating gifts intended for other nuns (Vin.iv.245-246, 
258). </p>
<p>She was fond of the company of men, and 
frequented streets and cross-roads unattended that she might not be hindered in 
her intrigues with men (Vin.iv.270, 273). </p>
<p>She seems to have regarded with sympathy 
women who succumbed to temptation and to have tried to shield them from 
discovery (Vin.iv.216, 225, 230f). </p>
<p>She bribed dancers and singers to sing 
her praises. She could brook no rival, and especially disliked 
<a href="bhaddaa.htm" title="b/bhaddaa.htm">Bhaddā</a>, whom she 
deliberately annoyed on more than one occasion (Vin.iv.283, 285, 287, 290, 292).
</p>
<p>She was fractious and would wish for 
something, but when that was procured for her, would say it was something else 
she really wanted (Vin.iv.248, 250). </p>
<p>She was evidently an admirer of Ānanda, 
and was greatly offended on hearing that Mahā Kassapa had called Ānanda “boy,” 
and gave vent to her displeasure at what she considered Kassapa’s presumption. 
But we are told that soon after that she left the Order (S.ii.219ff ). 
</p>
<p>She befriended Arittha when he was cast 
out of the Order (Vin.iv.218). The Suvannahamsa Jātaka was related in reference 
to her, and she is identified with the brahmin’s wife of the story (J.i.474f).</p>
