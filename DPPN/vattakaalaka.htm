<p>A village near Girikandaka vih훮ra. A girl of this village 
soared into the sky by the power of her rapture when thinking of the Buddha. Her 
parents went to the monastery, leaving her at home as she was unfit to walk. 
From her home she saw the monastery lighted up and heard the monks chanting, and 
was so filled with rapture that she was transported to the vih훮ra. Vsm.i.143f.; 
DhSA.116.</p>
