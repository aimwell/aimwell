<p>The story of how a forester, Sura, 
accidentally discovered strong drink, and how, with the help of his accomplice, 
the ascetic Varuna, he spread abroad the discovery, thus leading to the 
destruction of all Jambudīpa, had Sakka not appeared on earth and by his 
exposition of the evils of drink induced Sabbamitta, king of Sāvatthi, to 
abstain from its use.</p>
<p>The story was told in answer to a 
question by Visākhā as to the origin of drink. Once during a drinking festival 
at Sāvatthi five hundred women, friends of Visākhā visited Jetavana in her 
company. On the way they became drunk, which led to their behaving improperly in 
the monastery. The Buddha frightened them by his iddhi-power and restored them 
to their senses. (J.v.11ff; the DhA.iii.100ff gives a slightly different version 
of the doings of Visākhā’s friends).</p>
<p>The story of the past is also given in 
the Jātakamālā (No.17).</p>
