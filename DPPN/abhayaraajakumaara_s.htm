  <h2>Abhayarājakumāra Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It contains the episode of Prince 
<a href="abhaya.htm" title="am/abhaya.htm">Abhaya</a> visiting the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> and setting him the questions suggested 
by <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a>:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Would a <a href="tathaagata.htm" title="t/tathaagata.htm">Tathāgatha</a> 
say anything unpleasant or disagreeable to others? </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>If he did, how would he differ from 
ordinary men? </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>If he did not, how was it that the 
Buddha spoke of <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> as a reprobate, a 
child of perdition, etc. — words which angered and upset Devadatta?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha answered that the question 
needed qualification and, noticing that the prince was nursing his little boy, 
who lay in his lap, asked him what he would do if a pebble or a stick got into 
his mouth. “I should pull it out even if the blood flowed.” “Just so would a 
Buddha state unpleasant truths in due season if necessary and profitable.”</p>
<p>At the end of the discourse Abhaya 
accepts the Buddha as his Teacher (M.i.391ff).</p>
