  <h2>Culla-Dhammapāla Jātaka (No.358)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as 
Dhammapāla, son of Mahāpatāpa, king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and his queen, Candā. One day 
Candā was playing with her seven-months-old baby with whom she was so engrossed 
that, when the king entered the room, she omitted to rise.</p>
<p>This roused the king’s jealousy, and he 
sent for the executioner and had the prince’s hands and feet and head cut off 
and his body encircled with sword-cuts ” as though with a garland.” He paid no 
heed to Candā’s lamentations, and she, in her great sorrow, fell down dead of a 
broken heart. Flames arose from Avīci, and wrapping Mahāpatāpa about, “as with a 
woollen garment,” plunged him in the lowest hell.</p>
<p>The story was, told in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha. Devadatta was Mahāpatāpa and Mahā 
Pajāpatī was Candā (J.iii.177-82). The Jātaka is often cited (E.g., J.iv.11; 
v.113) to illustrate how anger, when once arisen, is difficult to control.</p>
