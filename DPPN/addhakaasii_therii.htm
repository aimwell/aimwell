<p>In Kassapa Buddha’s time she had been a 
nun well established in the precepts. But she reviled an arahant Therī by 
calling her a prostitute, and for this she was born in purgatory. In the present 
age she was the daughter of a rich and distinguished citizen of Benares but, 
because of her former evil speech, became a prostitute in Rājagaha. Having heard 
the Buddha preach, she entered the Order of the bhikkhunis. Wishing to obtain 
the higher ordination from the Buddha, she set out for Sāvatthi, but was waylaid 
and stopped by libertines. So she sent a man to ask the Buddha’s advice and he 
permitted her to be ordained by a messenger (Thig.vv.25-6; ThigA.30ff.; 
Vin.ii.277; Ap. ii. 610-11). Her case established a precedent (Sp.i.242). Later 
she attained arahantship.</p>
<p>It has been suggested (VT.iii.360, n.3; 
and VT.ii.195-6, n.3) that her name “half Kāsī” might mean that she charged five 
hundred pieces from her patrons. For, according to Buddhaghosa, Kāsī means one 
thousand, and anything worth one thousand is called kāsiya.</p>
<p>Another explanation is, however, given 
by Dhammapāla (ThigA.32). The revenue which accrued to the king for one day from 
Kāsī was a thousand. Addhakāsī’s patrons had to give a like sum to spend a night 
with her. This is referred to in one of the verses attributed to her in the 
Theragāthā (v.25). For this reason she was called Kāsī. But later, many men, not 
being able to afford a thousand, would pay half the amount and spend the day 
with her. As a result she became known as Addhakāsī.</p>
