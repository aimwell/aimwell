<p><b>1. Dūta Jātaka (No.260).</b>-Once the 
Bodhisatta was king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He was very dainty as to food, and spent so much 
on it that he came to be known as Bhojanasuddhika (Dainty-food). He always ate 
in a decorated pavilion in full view of his people. One day, a greedy man seeing 
him eat and wishing to taste the food, rushed up to him with clasped hands, 
saying that he was a messenger (dūta), messengers having free access to the 
king. Approaching the table, he snatched some food and thrust it into his mouth. 
The king’s attendants wished to behead him, but the king invited him to share 
his meal, and, at the conclusion, enquired as to his message. He said he was the 
messenger of Lust and of the Belly, and told the king how great was the power of 
these two. The king was pleased with him and gave him one thousand cows.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
greedy monk. J.ii.318-21.</p>

<p><b>2. Dūta Jātaka (No.478).</b>-The Bodhisatta 
was once a brahmin of Kāsi. He studied at Takkasilā, and wandered about begging 
for gold to pay his teacher. He collected a few ounces, but on his way back he 
was forced to cross the Ganges, and the gold fell into the river. He then 
thought out a plan and sat fasting on the bank of the river, refusing to speak 
to anybody until the king of Benares himself came. To him he told his story, 
pointing out that it would have been useless to tell the others, they being 
unable to help him. The king gave him twice the original quantity of gold.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
discussion by the monks as to the Buddha’s great resourcefulness. J.iv.224-8.</p>
