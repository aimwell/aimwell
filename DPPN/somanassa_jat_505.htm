  <h2>Somanassa Jātaka (No. 505)</h2>

<p>Once, when Renu was king of Uttarapañcāla, an ascetic, 
Mahārakkhita, visited him with five hundred others from the Himālaya. The king 
entertained them and told them of his worry because he had no sons. Some time 
later, when the ascetics were returning, Mahā Rakkhita saw that the king would 
have a son and told his companions so. One of the ascetics, a cheat, hoping to 
get gain thereby, feigned illness, and, returning to the palace, told the king 
that a son would be born to his queen, Sudhammā. The king showed him great 
honour, and he came to be called Dibbacakkhuka. In due course, the Bodhisatta 
was born as the king’s son, and was named Somanassa. When the boy was seven 
years old the king had to leave home to quell a border rising, and Somanassa was 
left in the charge of the cheating ascetic. The boy soon discovered his real 
nature and paid him no honour. As soon as the king returned, Dibbacakkhu 
complained to him that the prince had ill treated him. Somanassa was ordered to 
be executed, but he exposed the cheat’s knavery, and men, sent to search his 
hut, found bundles of money in it. Disgusted with life at court, Somanassa 
obtained the king’s leave and became an ascetic in the Himālaya, where 
Vissakamma, commanded by Sakka, built a hermitage for him. The cheat was stoned 
to death by the people.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempt 
to kill the Buddha. He is identified with Dibbacakkhu, Sāriputta with 
Mahārakkhita and Somanassa’s mother with Mahāmāyā. J.iv.445ff.</p>
