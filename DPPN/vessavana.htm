<p>One of the names of <a href="kuvera.htm" title="ku/kuvera.htm">Kuvera</a>, given to him because 
his kingdom is called Visānā (D.iii.201; SNA.i.369, etc.). He is one of the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājāno</a> and rules over the Yakkhas, his kingdom being in the 
north (E.g., D.ii.207). In the Ātānātiya Sutta he is the spokesman, and he 
recited the Ātānātiya-rune for the protection of the Buddha and his followers 
from the Yakkhas who had no faith in the Buddha. D.iii.194; he was spokesman 
because “he was intimate with the Buddha, expert in conversation, well trained” 
(DA.iii.962).</p>
<p>He rides in the Nārīvāhana, which is twelve yojanas long, 
its seat being of coral. His retinue is composed of ten thousand crores of 
Yakkhas. (SNA.i.379; the preacher’s seat in the Lohapāsāda at Anurādhapura was 
made in the design of the Nārīvāhana, Mhv.xxvii.29). He is a sotāpanna and his 
life span is ninety thousand years (AA.ii.718). The books record a conversation 
between him and Velukantakī Nandamāta (q.v.), when he heard her sing the 
Parāyana Vagga and stayed to listen. When Cūlasubhaddā wished to invite the 
Buddha and his monks to her house in Sāketa, and felt doubtful about it, 
Vessavana appeared before her and said that the Buddha would come at her 
invitation (AA.ii.483).</p>
<p>On another occasion (A.iv.162; on his way to see the 
Buddha) he heard Uttara Thera preaching to the monks in Dhavajālikā on the 
Sankheyya Mountain, near Mahisavatthu, and went and told Sakka, who visited 
Uttara and had a discussion with him.</p>
<p>Once when Vessavana was travelling through the air, he saw 
Sambhūta Thera wrapt in samādhi. Vessavana descended from his chariot, 
worshipped the Thera, and left behind two Yakkhas with orders to wait until the 
Elder should emerge from his trance. The Yakkhas then greeted the Thera in the 
name of Vessavana and told him they had been left to protect him. The Elder sent 
thanks to Vessavana, but informed him, through the Yakkhas, that the Buddha had 
taught his disciples to protect themselves through mindfulness, and so further 
protection was not needed. Vessavana visited Sambhūta on his return, and finding 
that the Elder had become an arahant, went to Sāvatthi and carried the news to 
the Buddha. ThagA.i.46f. Just as he encouraged the good, so he showed his 
resentment against the wicked; see, e.g., Revatī.</p>
<p>Mention is made of Vessavana’s Gadāvudha* and his mango 
tree, the Atulamba**. Alavaka’s abode was near that of Vessavana (SNA.i.240).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* SNA.i.225; the books (e,g., SA.i.249; Sp.ii.440) are 
  careful to mention that he used his Gadāvudha only while he was yet a 
  puthujjana.</p>
  <p>** J.iv.324, also called Abbhantaramba (see the 
  Abbharantara Jātaka).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bimbisāra, after death, was born seven times as one of the 
ministers (paricaraka) of Vessavana, and, while on his way with a message from 
Vessavana to Virūlhaka, visited the Buddha and gave him an account of a meeting 
of the devas which Vessavana had attended and during which Sanankumāra had 
spoken in praise of the Buddha and his teachings (D.ii.206f). Vessavana seems to 
have been worshipped by those desiring children. See, e.g., the story of 
Rājadatta (ThagA.i.403). There was in Anurādhapura a banyan tree dedicated as a 
shrine to Vessavana in the time of Pandukābhaya (Mhv.x.89). Vessavana is 
mentioned as having been alive in the time of Vipassī Buddha. When Vipassī died, 
there was a great earthquake which terrified the people, but Vessavana appeared 
and quieted their fears (ThagA.i.149). Vessavana accompanied Sakka when he 
showed Moggallāna round Vejayanta pāsāda. M.i.253; because he was Sakka’s very 
intimate friend (MA.i.476).</p>
<p>As lord of the Yakkhas, it was in the power of Vessavana 
to grant to any of them special privileges, such as the right of devouring 
anyone entering a particular pond, etc. See, e.g., DhA.iii.74; J.i.128; iii.325 
(Makhādeva). Sometimes, e.g., in the case of Avaruddhaka (DhA.ii.237), a Yakkha 
had to serve Vessavana for twelve years in order to obtain a particular boon 
(cf. J.ii.16,17). (Three years at J.iii.502.) Vessavana some times employs the 
services of uncivilized human beings (paccantamilakkhavāsika) DA.iii.865f. The 
Yakkhas fear him greatly. If he is angry and looks but once, one thousand 
Yakkhas are broken up and scattered “like parched peas hopping about on a hot 
plate” (J.ii.399). This was probably before he became a sotāpanna.</p>
<p>Vessavana, like Sakka, was not the name of a particular 
being, but of the holder of an office. When one Vessavana died, Sakka chose 
another as his successor. The new king, on his accession, sent word to all the 
Yakkhas, asking them to choose their special abodes (J.i.328). It was the duty 
of Yakkhinīs to fetch water from Anotatta for Vessavana’s use. Each Yakkhinī 
served her turn, sometimes for four, sometimes for five months. But sometimes 
they died from exhaustion before the end of their term. (DhA.i.40; also 
J.iv.492; v.21).</p>
<p>Vessavana’s wife was Bhuñjatī (q.v.), who, like himself, 
was a devoted follower of the Buddha (D.ii.270). They had five daughters: Latā, 
Sajjā, Pavarā, Acchimatī, and Sutā. For a story about them, see VvA.131f. 
</p>
<p>Punnaka was Vessavana’s nephew. J.vi.265, 326.</p>
<p>The pleasures and luxuries enjoyed by Vessavana have 
become proverbial. See, e.g., Vv.iv. 3, 46 (bhuñjāmi kāmakāmī rājā Vessavano 
yathā); MT. 676 (Vessavanassa rājaparihārasadisam); cf. J.vi.313.</p>
<p>An ascetic named Kañcanapatti (J.ii.399) is mentioned as 
having been the favourite of Vessavana. See also Yakkha.</p>
