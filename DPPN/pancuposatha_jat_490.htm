<p>Once four animals – </p>
<ol>
  <li>a wood pigeon, </li>
  <li>a snake, </li>
  <li>a jackal, and </li>
  <li>a bear </li>
</ol>
<p>lived on friendly terms with the Bodhisatta, who was an 
ascetic, add, with him as their teacher, they all kept the uposatha to rid 
themselves of their sins and desires. The pigeon had yearned too much after his 
mate, who was killed by a hawk; the snake had killed a bull, which trod on it; 
the jackal had lost his hair by clinging too long to an elephantâ€™s corpse; the 
bear had received many blows when he visited a village for food; while the 
ascetic himself had been proud until visited by a Pacceka Buddha, who pointed 
out to him the folly of pride.</p>
<p>Anuruddha was the pigeon, Kassapa the bear, MoggallÄna the 
jackal, and SÄriputta the snake.</p>
<p>The JÄtaka was related to five hundred upÄsakas to 
encourage them to keep the fast days. J.iv.325ff.</p>
