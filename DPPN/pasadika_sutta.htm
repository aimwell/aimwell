<p>The twenty ninth sutta of the

<p>Cunda 
Samanuddesa, who had been spending the rainy season at <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>, returns and reports 
to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> the death of 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a> and the consequent wrangling which had 
broken out among the Niganthas. Together they visit the Buddha at
<a href="samagama.htm" title="sa/samagama.htm">Sāmagāma</a> and 
tell him of it. He replies that this is to be expected from the character of 
Nātaputta and from the doctrine which he taught. The Buddha then proceeds to 
give in detail the qualities of the perfect teacher and the perfect teaching. 
The <a href="tathaagata.htm" title="t/tathaagata.htm">Tathāgata</a> is such a teacher and the Dhamma such a teaching (D.iii.117 41).</p>
<p>In the Pāsādika Sutta the threefold training is called 
brahmacariyā. DA.i.179; MA.i.275.</p>
