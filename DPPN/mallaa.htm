  <h2>Mallā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name of a people and their country.  </p>
<p>The country is 
included in the sixteen <a href="mahajanapada.htm" title="maha/mahajanapada.htm">Mahājanapadas</a> of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, 
at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in
<a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a> and <a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusinārā</a>. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyaka Mallā, those of 
Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact 
that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to 
claim their share of the Buddha’s relics (D.ii.165). Each had their Mote Hall. 
 
</p>
<p>In the Sangīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his 
journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of 
<a href="cunda.htm" title="c/cunda.htm">Cunda</a> the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for 
the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that 
it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and 
preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha 
took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda (D.ii.126f). From 
there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent 
<a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his 
approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where 
the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand 
in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing 
the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more 
in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a>. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the 
<a href="makutabandhana.htm" title="ma/makutabandhana.htm">Makutabandhana</a> cetiya, and 
then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding 
them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were 
distributed among the various claimants by Dona (D.ii.166). The Mallas, both of 
Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and 
held feasts in their honour (D.ii.167).</p>
<p>The Malla capital of Kujsinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a 
place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little 
wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite 
unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs 
Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī (q.v.), the mighty capital of Kusa and 
Mahāsudassana. This shows that the Mallas had, at first, a monarchical 
constitution, but in the sixth century B.C. they were regarded, together with 
the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic (sangha, gana) (M.i.231). The 
chief Mallas administered the state in turn. Those who were free from such 
duties engaged in trade, sometimes undertaking long caravan journeys 
(DA.ii.569).</p>
<p>Both the Buddha and Nigantha Nātaputta appear to have had 
followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nātaputta’s death, just as 
Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s (see Pāvā). Several followers of the Buddha among 
the Mallas are mentioned by name — e.g., Dabba, 
Pukkusa, Khandasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Roja and Sīha (q.v.). The Mallas seem 
to have lived at peace with their neighbours, though there was apparently some 
trouble between them and the Licchavis, as shown by the story of Bandhula Malla 
(q.v.). Both the Mallas and the Licchavis were khattiyas, belonging to the 
Vasittha gotta, because in the books both tribes are repeatedly referred to as 
Vāsetthā (q.v.). Manu says that both Licchavis and Mallas had ksatriya parents, 
but their fathers were Vrātyas — i.e., had not 
gone through the ceremony of Vedic initiation at the proper time. </p>
<p>There is reason to believe that the Malla republic fell 
into the hands of Ajātasattu, as did that of the Licchavis (Bhandarkar, 
Carmichael Lectures, 1918, p.79).</p>
<p>The Mallas are generally identified with the Malloi 
mentioned in the Greek accounts of Alexander’s invasion of India. The Malloi 
were a warlike tribe who, for some time, successfully resisted Alexander’s 
attack. Their territory must have been situated in or near the Panjab.</p>
<p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and 
Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed — 
e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiyā and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide 
tract of forest.</p>
<p>Bandhula went from Kusināra to Takkasilā for purposes of 
study. v.l. Mālā (E.g., UdA.377) and Malatā (E.g., AA.ii.814), evidently both 
wrong readings.</p>
