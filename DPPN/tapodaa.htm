<p>A large lake below the Vebhāra mountain, 
outside Rājagaha. The lake was cool, but the stream flowing from it, also called 
Tapodā (Vin.iii.108; iv.116f; DA.i.35; UdA.110), was hot. Around it was the 
Tapodārāma (q.v.). </p>
<p>It is said (SA.i.30f; Sp.ii.512) that 
the water of the river was hot because it flowed between two Lohakumbhi-nirayas, 
which existed under Rājagaha. The lake was the playground of the Nāgas who dwelt 
at the foot of the Vebhāra mountain. Monks and recluses were evidently in the 
habit of going to the Tapodā to bathe in the hot springs. Thus, we find Samiddhi 
being questioned by a deity as he dried himself after bathing in the Tapodā 
(S.i.8ff; M.iii.192ff; J.ii.56), and the Anguttara Nikāya (v.196f) records a 
discussion between Ānanda and the paribbājaka Kokanuda, on the banks of the 
Tapodā, where they had gone to bathe.</p>
