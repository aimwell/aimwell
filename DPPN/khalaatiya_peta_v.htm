</ul>
<p>The story of a courtesan. She had 
beautiful hair which, however, she lost, owing to the machinations of a rival. 
She once stole clothes from some men who lay asleep, and on another occasion 
gave alms to a monk. She was later born in an ocean vimāna as a naked peta with 
lovely hair; some merchants, while going to Suvannabhūmi, saw her, and on 
learning her story gave clothes on her behalf to a pious man in their company, 
and as a result clothes immediately appeared on her. Later the merchants gave 
alms to the Buddha in her name, and she was born in Tāvatimsa. Pv.i.10; 
PvA.46ff.</p>
