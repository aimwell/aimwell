<p>Son of Mahādhanadeva, of Mahāgāma. When 
he was a child he was called Keliyatissa, because he liked to play. Later he 
joined the Order. Dissatisfied after five years, he gave up his robes and swam 
down a river. Two women bathing saw him and both claimed him. When they saw he 
was naked one went to fetch clothes; the other gave him half her garment and 
took him to her parents and married him. The wife was Sumanā. Because he was 
found in the river he was called Ganga-tissa; but because he was lazy they 
called him Nikkammatissa. Sumanā’s people complained of him and sent them away. 
Tissa sought work under a headman, Candasuriya, a friend of Mahādhanadeva, and 
reaped and threshed a field of 500 karīsas in one day. Candasuriya, marvelling 
at his strength, gave him all the grain.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Tissa and his wife gave alms 
daily to eight monks, but as his meals were not tasty, the monks called him 
Udakalonatissa. Discovering this, he gave them milk rice and was called 
Khīrabhatta-tissa. Later he gave rice mixed with ghee and his name became 
Kalyānabhatta-tissa. In due course he fed 500 monks daily. One day, while 
looking for yams in Kumbulapabbata, he discovered 60 treasure troves and took 
them home. Later he fed many thousands of monks in Cetiyamba-vihāra, 
Anurādhapura and Nāgadīpa and lived in Ariyagālatittha as a ferryman, taking 
people across, free of charge. Sakka, wishing to test him, came as an old 
brahmin and, having tried his patience, filled his house with valuables and gave 
him a field of rice.</p>
<p>Once a discussion arose in Piyangudīpa, 
as to where the most devout people were to be found. Satisambodhi Thera said 
they were in Ceylon, while Yonakarājaputta Mahābuddharakkhita said they were in 
Yonakarattha. To test this, Satisambodhi arrived in Tissa’s house. His wife, 
having fed 12,000 monks, was resting, but having seen the Elder she prepared for 
him a bowl of catuma-dhura. He asked her to throw the bowl up into the air. It 
travelled to Piyangudīpa, and Sumanā saw the monks as they ate the contents.</p>
<p>As Tissa lay dying, devas brought him 
chariots from the six deva worlds; he chose to be born in Tusita. His wife, 
knowing his wishes, retired into her room and died before him. They were both 
born in Tusita. In a past birth Tissa had been in Chagāma and honoured the Bodhi-tree 
there. Ras.ii.34f.</p>
