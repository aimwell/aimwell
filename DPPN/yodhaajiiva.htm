</ul>
<p>A headman (gāmanī) who visited the Buddha and asked if it 
was true that men who fall fighting in battle are reborn among the Sārañjita 
devas. </p>
<p>At first the Buddha refused to answer the question, but 
finding that Yodhājīva insisted, explained to him that fighting men were reborn 
after death either in the Sārājita niraya or among animals. </p>
<p>The headman became the Buddha’s follower. S.iv.308.</p>
