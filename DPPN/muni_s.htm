  <h2>Muni Sutta</h2>

<p>The twelfth sutta of the Sutta Nipāta (SN., pp. 35 8).
</p>
<p>It defines the muni as one who lives the homeless life, 
free of encumbrances, devoid of strife and covetousness, firm, self restrained, 
thoughtful, and delighting in meditation. He has overcome all obstacles and 
knows all things. He is as different from a householder as a peacock from a fast 
flying swan. According to the Commentary (SNA.i.254 t ) the sutta is a composite 
one made up of stanzas preached on various occasions; thus, the first four 
verses had reference to a mother and a son who joined the Order, met frequently, 
and, owing to their affection for each other, fell into sin (Cp. Mātuputtika 
Sutta). The fifth was in reference to Upaka’s attainment of anāgāmiphala; the 
sixth to Khadiravaniya Revata; the seventh was preached to Suddhodana to explain 
why the Buddha had renounced his luxuries. The ninth was in reference to Ciñcā’s 
attempt to malign the Buddha; the tenth was preached to the daughter of a 
Sāvatthi setthi. Seeing a weaver’s spindle and reflecting on it, she realized 
the crookedness of beings and was disgusted with the worldly life. The Buddha, 
reading her thoughts, appeared before her in a ray of light and preached to her. 
The eleventh was preached to the seven year old daughter of a weaver of Alavi, 
who became a sotāpanna and died soon after (See DhA.iii.170ff). The twelfth was 
preached to the brahmin Pañcaggadāyaka; and the thirteenth was in reference to a 
treasurer of Sāvatthi who joined the Order and left it three times, on the 
fourth time of joining he became an arahant. The fourteenth was in reference to 
the Buddha’s cousin Nanda, who was being teased by the monks even after he had 
attained arahantship. The last was in defence of a monk for whom a hunter 
conceived a friendship, providing him with alms; the monk was a forest dweller, 
and men blamed him saying that he told the hunter of the animals' haunts.</p>
