<p>Son of Venigāma. He was very rich; but 
once, during a drought, there being no food, he made ready to go to the 
mountains with his retinue. Just before starting they found a measure of rice, 
and, having cooked it, were about to eat it, when Amba saw Cūlapindapātika-Nāga 
Thera returning from the village with empty bowl. He invited the monk and gave 
him the food. </p>
<p>The Thera retired into the forest and 
attained arahantship before eating it. Tired and hungry, Amba slept, and, on 
waking, asked his wife if any scrapings were left. She went into the kitchen and 
found the pot full of food, which they shared with the whole village.
