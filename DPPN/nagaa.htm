<h4>1. Nāgā</h4>
<p>Chief woman disciple of Sujāta Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xiii.26.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Nāgā</h4>
<p>One of the chief women supporters of Phussa Buddha. 
Bu.xix.21.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Nāgā</h4>
<p>A former birth of Asokamālā, when she was the wife of 
Tissa (later Sāliya), an artisan of Mundagangā. MT.605.</p>
<hr>
<h4>4. Nāgā Therī</h4>
<p>An arahant of Bhātaragāma. During the pillage of Brāhmana 
Tissa, when all the villagers had fled, she went with her colleagues to a banyan 
tree, the presiding deity of which provided them with food. She had a brother, 
Nāga; when he visited her she gave him part of her food, but he refused to 
accept food from a bhikkhuni. MA.i.546; AA.ii.654.</p>
<hr>
<h4>5. Nāgā</h4>
<p>A class of beings. See Appendix.</p>
<hr>
<h4>6. Nāga</h4>
<p>An eminent Therī of Ceylon. Dpv.xviii.35.</p>
<hr>
<h4>7. Nāgā</h4>
<p>A woman who lived near the 
Rājāyatana-cetiya. Once, seeing sixty monks return from the village with empty 
bowls, she, although already pledged to work by day, borrowed some money on 
promise to work at night as well, and gave them food. The monks retired to 
Mucalindavana and developed arahantship before eating. The deity of the king’s 
parasol shouted applause, and the king, having heard the story, gave Nāgā the 
whole island, which thus came to be called Nāgādipa. Ras.ii.16f.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h4>8. Nāgā</h4>
<p>A class of beings classed with Garulas 
and Supannas and playing a prominent part in Buddhist folk lore. They are gifted 
with miraculous powers and great strength. Generally speaking, they are confused 
with snakes, chiefly the hooded Cobra, and their bodies are described as being 
those of snakes, though they can assume human form at will. They are broadly 
divided into two classes: those that live on land (thalaja) and those that live 
on water (jalaja). The Jalaja-nāgā live in rivers as well as in the sea, while 
the Thalaja-nāgā are regarded as living beneath the surface of the earth. 
Several Nāga dwellings are mentioned in the books: e.g., Mañjerika-bhavana under 
Sineru, Daddara-bhavana at the foot of Mount Daddara in the Himālaya, the 
Dhatarattha-nāgā under the river Yamunā, the Nābhāsā Nāgā in Lake Nabhasa, and 
also the Nāgas of Vesāli, Tacchaka, and Payāga (D.ii.258). The Vinaya (ii.109) 
contains a list of four royal families of Nāgas (Ahirājakulāni): Virūpakkhā, 
Erāpathā, Chabyāputtā and Kanhagotamakā. Two other Nāga tribes are generally 
mentioned together: the Kambalas and the Assataras. It is said (SA.iii.120) that 
all Nāgas have their young in the Himālaya.</p>
<p>Stories are given — e.g., in the 
Bhūridatta Jātaka — of Nāgas, both male and female, mating with humans; but the 
offspring of such unions are watery and delicate (J.vi.160). The Nāgas are 
easily angered and passionate, their breath is poisonous, and their glance can 
be deadly (J.vi.160, 164). They are carnivorous (J.iii.361), their diet 
consisting chiefly of frogs (J.vi.169), and they sleep, when in the world of 
men, on ant hills (ibid., 170). The enmity between the Nāgas and the Garulas is 
proverbial (D.ii.258). At first the Garulas did not know how to seize the Nāgas, 
because the latter swallowed large stones so as to be of great weight, but they 
learnt how in the Pandara Jātaka (q.v.). The Nāgas dance when music is played, 
but it is said (J.vi.191) that they never dance if any Garula is near (through 
fear) or in the presence of human dancers (through shame).</p>
<p>The best known of all Nāgas is Mahākāla, 
king of Mañjerika-bhavana (q.v.). He lives for a whole kappa, and is a very 
pious follower of the Buddha. The Nāgas of his world had the custodianship of a 
part of the Buddha’s relics till they were needed for the Māha Thūpa 
(Mhv.xxxi.27f.), and when the Bodhi tree was being brought to Ceylon they did it 
great honour during the voyage (Mbv. p.. 163f.). Other Nāga kings are also 
mentioned as ruling with great power and majesty and being converted to the 
Buddha’s faith — e.g., Aravāla, Apalālā, Erapatta, NandopĀnanda, and Pannaka. 
(See also Ahicchatta and Ahināga.) In the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.198f.), 
speaking of dwellers of the Cātummahārajika world, the Nāgas are mentioned as 
occupying the Western Quarter, with Virūpokkha as their king.</p>
<p>The Nāgas had two chief settlements in 
Ceylon, in Nāgadīpa (q.v.) and at the mouth of the river Kalyānī. It was to 
settle a dispute between two Nāga chiefs of Nāgadīpa, Mahodara and Cūlodara, 
that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon. During that visit he made a 
promise to another Nāga-king, Manjakkhika of Kalyānī, to pay him a visit, and 
the Buddha’s third visit was in fulfilment of that undertaking (Mhv.i.48f.).</p>
<p>The Nāgas form one of the guards set up 
by Sakka in Sineru against the Asuras (J.i.204). The Nāgas were sometimes 
worshipped by human beings and were offered sacrifices of milk, rice, fish, meat 
and strong drink (J.i.497f.). The jewel of the Nāgas is famous for its beauty 
and its power of conferring wishes to its possessor (J.vi.179, 180).</p>
<p>The word Nāga is often used as an 
epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants, and in this connection the etymology 
given is āgum na karotī ti Nāgo (e.g., MNid.201). The Bodhisatta was born 
several times as king of the Nāgas: Atula, Campeyya, Bhūridatta, Mahādaddara, 
and Sankhapāla.</p>
<p>In the accounts given of the Nāgas, 
there is undoubtedly great confusion between the Nāgas as supernatural beings, 
as snakes, and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too 
difficult to unravel.</p>
