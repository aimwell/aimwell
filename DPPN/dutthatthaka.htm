<p>The third Sutta of the Atthakavagga of 
the Sutta Nipāta (SN.vs.780-87). The sutta was preached in reference to the 
calumny raised against the Buddha by the heretics who used the female ascetic 
Sundarī to further their ends (SNA.ii.518f). Commentarial explanation of this is 
included in the Mahāniddesa (i.62ff). The burden of the sutta is that he who 
praises his own virtue and is dependent upon varying dogmas of philosophy is 
constantly censured. The muni is one who has shaken off all systems of 
philosophy.</p>
