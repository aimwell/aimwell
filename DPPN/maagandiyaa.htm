<p>Daughter of the brahmin <a href="maagandiya.htm" title="ma/maagandiya.htm">Māgandiya</a>. When the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> 
rejected her father’s offer of marriage with her, her parents joined the Order, 
giving her in charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya. The latter took her to 
<a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>, king of <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>, who made her his chief consort, giving her five hundred 
ladies in waiting. Māgandiyā was incensed against the Buddha for having called 
her a “vessel of filth,” and, when he came to Kosambī, she planned her revenge. 
Having discovered that Udena’s other queen, <a href="samavati.htm" title="sa/samavati.htm">Sāmāvatī</a>, and her companions were in 
the habit of watching for the Buddha through windows in the walls of their 
rooms, she told the king that Sāmāvatī and her friends were conspiring to kill 
him. For some time the king refused to believe this, but when the holes were 
shown to him, he had them closed up and the windows built higher.</p>
<p>This plan having failed, Māgandiyā hired a slave to revile 
and abuse the Buddha in the streets. <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> suggested to the Buddha that they 
should go elsewhere. The Buddha answered, “I am like the elephant who has 
entered the fray, I must endure the darts that come upon me. After seven days 
the abuse ceased. Māgandiyā then persuaded her uncle to send eight live cocks to 
the palace and sent a page with them to the king’s drinking place. When the king 
asked what should be done with them, she suggested that Sāmāvatī and her friends 
should be asked to cook them for him. This the king agreed to do, but the women 
refused to deprive an animal of its life. Māgandiyā said they should be tested, 
and sent word by the page that the cocks were to be cooked for the Buddha. The 
page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and Sāmāvatī 
and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha. But even then 
the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of 
Sāmāvatī’s disloyalty.</p>
<p>Māgandiyā then obtained a snake from her uncle with its 
fangs removed. This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried 
about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers. Udena was in the habit of 
spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts. When he announced his 
intention of going to Sāmāvatī, Māgandiyā begged of him not to go, saying she 
had had a dream and feared for his safety. But the king went and Māgandiyā went 
with him. As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the 
bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow. Māgandiyā screamed and 
accused Sāmāvatī of designs on the king’s life. This time Udena believed her, 
and placing Sāmāvati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for 
his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at 
Sāmāvatī’s breast. But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce 
her. Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave 
her a boon. She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace 
every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ānanda in his 
place.</p>
<p>Once more Māgandiyā conspired with her uncle against 
Sāmāvatī. They had all the pillars of Sāmāvatī’s house wrapt in cloth, soaked in 
oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to. 
Sāmāvatī saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, 
and they attained to various fruits of the Path. Udena questioned Māgandiyā very 
carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime. 
He then sent for all Māgandiya’s relations saying that he wished to reward them. 
He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the 
straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed 
with an iron plough. Pieces of flesh were ripped from Māgandiyā’s body, fried 
like cakes in oil, and Māgandiyā was then forced to eat them. </p>

Māgandiyā is called Anūpamā.</p>
