  <h2>Theragāthā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The eighth book of the Khuddaka-Nikāya, 
a collection of poems, most of which are believed to have been composed by 
theras during the lifetime of the Buddha. </p>
<p>Some poems contain life-histories of the 
theras, while others are paeans of joy, extolling their new-found freedom.
</p>
<p>The work has been published by the P.T.S. 
(1883) and translated by Mrs. Rhys Davids, as Psalms of the Brethren.</p>
<p>Dhammapāla wrote a commentary on the 
Theragāthā, as part of the Paramatthadīpanī.</p>
