<p>A slave in the village of Gayā. Her mistress disliked her and ill treated her 
in every way. One day, in order to escape being pulled by her hair, she had her 
head shaved; but her mistress then had a rope tied round her head, with which 
she pulled her about; hence her name. Unable to bear her life any longer, the 
slave went into the village near by, intending to commit suicide, but there she 
found the Buddha waiting for her, and he preached to her. Rajjumālā, became a 
sotāpanna, and then returned to her mistress, who, having heard her story, 
visited the Buddha and became his follower. The Buddha explained that the two 
women had had their positions reversed in a previous birth, and that the then 
slave, who was the mistress in the present birth, had vowed vengeance for the 
cruelty inflicted upon her. Rajjumālā was freed and was born after death in 
Tāvatimsa. Vv.iv.12; VvA.206ff.</p>
