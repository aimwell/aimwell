<h4>1. Assaji Thera</h4>
<p>The fifth of the 
<a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiya</a> monks. 
When the Buddha preached the <a href="dhammacakkappavattana.htm" title="d/dhammacakkappavattana.htm">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>, he was the last in 
whom dawned the eye of Truth, and the Buddha had to discourse to him and to
<a href="mahanama_th.htm" title="maha/mahanama_th.htm">Mahānāma</a> while their three colleagues went for alms (Vin.i.13. He became a 
sotāpanna on the fourth day of the quarter, AA.i.84). He became an arahant, 
together with the others, at the preaching of the <a href="anattalakhana_s.htm" title="ay/anattalakhana_s.htm">Anattalakkhana Sutta</a> 
(Vin.i.14; J.i.82). </p>
<p>He was responsible for the conversion of 
Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Sāriputta, in the course of his wanderings in search 
of Eternal Truth, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rājagaha, and being pleased 
with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round. Finding a 
suitable opportunity, Sāriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines 
he followed. Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he 
said, he was but young in the Order. But Sāriputta urged him to say what he 
knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as 
representing the keynote of the Buddha’s teaching:</p>
<p>“ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesam hetum 
Tathāgato āha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evamvādī Mahāsamano.”</p>
<p>Sāriputta immediately understood and 
hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallāna that he had succeeded in his 
quest. Vin.i.39ff.; the incident is related in the DhA (i.75ff.) with slight 
variations as to detail.</p>
<p>Sāriputta held Assaji in the highest 
veneration, and we are told that from the day of this first meeting, in whatever 
quarter he heard that Assaji was staying, in that direction he would extend his 
clasped hands in an attitude of reverent supplication, and in that direction he 
would turn his head when he lay down to sleep (DhA.iv.150-1).</p>
<p>One day when Assaji was going about in 
Vesāli for alms, the Nigantha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of 
disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha’s 
teaching because he was a well-known disciple (ñātaññatara-sāvaka). Assaji gave 
him a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhana Sutta. Feeling 
sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went 
with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was 
the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta (M.i.227ff). The 
Commentary (MA.i.452) tells us that Assaji decided on this method of exposition 
because he did not wish to leave Saccaka any loophole for contentious 
questioning. </p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.124ff) 
records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in 
Kassapārāma near Rājagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into jhāna 
because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. 
The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and 
non-self.</p>
