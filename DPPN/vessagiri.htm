<p>A monastery in Ceylon, near Anurādhapura. It was built by 
Devānampiyatissa for the five hundred vessas (merchants) who were ordained by 
Mahinda (Mhv.xx.15; Mhv. Trs. 137, n.3). Near the monastery was a forest, where 
Vattagāmanī, in his flight, hid the alms bowl of the Buddha. There he also met 
the Elder Kupikkala Mahātissa (Mhv.xxxiii.48f). The alms bowl was discovered and 
taken by a Damila to India, but was later recovered (Mhv.xxxiii.55). To the 
south of Vessagiri was the Pabbata vihāra, and, near it, the village of 
Silāsobbhakandaka. MT.616.</p>
