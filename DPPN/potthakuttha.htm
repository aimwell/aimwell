endowed the Mātambiyapadhānaghara, and built houses in the Kuppurā parivepa, the 
Kurundapillaka vihāra and the Mahārājaghara. Whem the king died, he administered 
the kingdom, threw the sub king Dāthāsiva into prison and set Datta of 
Dhanapitthi on the throne. When Datta died, Potthakuttha had Hatthadātha crowned 
king. Later, when Mānavamma rebelled against him, he ate poisoned food, provided 
by his friend, the chief of Merukandara, and died. Cv.xlvi.19, 39, 44; xlvii.55,
