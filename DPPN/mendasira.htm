<p>An arahant Thera. He was born in the family of a burgher 
of Sāketa and was so called because his head resembled that of a ram. When the 
Buddha was staying in Añjanavana in Sāketa, Mendasira heard him preach and 
entered the Order, attaining arahantship in due course.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he lived near Mount Gotama 
in Himavā with a large following of ascetics. There they met the Buddha and 
offered him lotus flowers. Fifty one kappas ago he was a king named Januttama (Jaluttama) 
(Thag.78; ThagA.i.171f). He is evidently to be identified with Padumapūjaka of 
the Apadāna. Ap.i.102f.</p>
