<p>A king of Kosala. His kingdom was 
captured by Brahmadatta, king of Kāsi, and he and his wife fled to 
<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, 
where they lived in disguise in the house of a potter. His wife bore a son named Dīghāyu (v.l. Dighāvu). Before his birth, his mother had a craving to see the 
army drawn up in battle array, its swords tempered. Dīghīti appeased her craving 
with the help of his friend, the chaplain of Brahmadatta. Dīghāyu was sent away 
from the city lest harm should befall him, Later, Dīghīti’s place of refuge was 
discovered and he and his wife were being led to the place of execution when 
Dighāyu, who was on a visit to the city, saw them. Dīghīti, recognising his son, 
called to him his dying advice “mā dīgham passa mā rassam ” (look not too far 
nor too near). Dīghāyu heard and understood; he entered the service of 
Brahmadatta, first as an elephant-trainer, then as a musician, and finally as 
his personal servant. He wished to avenge the death of his parents, but when the 
occasion arose, he remembered his father’s instructions and desisted.
