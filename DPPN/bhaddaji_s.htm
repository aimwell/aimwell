<p>A discussion between Bhaddaji and Ānanda at the 
Ghositārāma. In answer to Ānanda’s questions, Bhaddaji says that Brahmā is the 
best of sights; the best of sounds is that of Radiant Devas shouting “Joy, joy,” 
etc. Ānanda says that such is the talk of puthujjanas. The best sight, in his 
view, is that of the destruction of the āsavas; the best sound that of their 
destruction, etc. A.iii.202f.</p>
