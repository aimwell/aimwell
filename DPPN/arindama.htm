<p><b>1. Arindama.</b>-The Bodhisatta, born as 
King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and son of the Magadha King of Rājagaha. During the time of 
Sikhī Buddha he held a great almsgiving for the Buddha and his monks; he 
presented to the Order a fully caparisoned elephant which he redeemed by giving 
suitable gifts to the height of an elephant (J.i.41; Bu.xxi.9). He had as friend 
the chaplain’s son, Sonaka. They both studied in Takkasilā and at the conclusion 
of their studies they travelled about in search of experience. In the course of 
their travels Arindama was elected to succeed the King of Benares who had died 
childless, and Sonaka became a Pacceka Buddha. Forty years later Arindama wished 
to see Sonaka, but no one could tell him his whereabouts in spite of the offer 
of a large reward. Ten years later Sonaka saw the king through the good offices 
of a lad of seven, who belonged to the harem and had learnt a song composed by 
the king expressing his desire to meet Sonaka. At the meeting, however, the king 
failed to recognise him. Sonaka, not revealing his identity, spoke to the king 
about the joys of renunciation, and disappeared through the air. The king, moved 
by his words, decided to give up the throne and to follow the ascetic life. He 
appointed his eldest son Dīghāvu king in his stead, handed over to him all his 
possessions, and developing supernatural faculties was born in the Brahma world 
(J.v.247-61).</p>
<p>Arindama is mentioned together with 
Mahājanaka as an example of a king who renounced a mighty kingdom to lead a 
hermit’s life (J.iii.489). The story also appears in the Mahāvastu (iii.449ff), 
but the details given differ from those of the Jātaka version. There Arindama is 
spoken of as the King of Mithilā.</p>
<p>In both accounts Dīghāvu’s mother, the 
king’s chief queen, is spoken of as having died before the king’s renunciation.</p>
<p>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary 
(BuA.203), Arindama’s capital was Paribhuttanagara. (v.l. Arindamaka.)</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Arindama.</b>-King in the time of Sumana 
Buddha. A great dispute had arisen at this time regarding nirodha and all the 
inhabitants of many thousand world systems were divided into two camps. In order 
to settle their doubts, the disputants, with Arindama at their head, sought the 
Buddha. The Buddha sat on Mount Yugandhara while Arindama, with his ninety 
thousand crores of followers, sat on a golden rock, which by the power of his 
merit had sprung from the earth near Sankassa. The Buddha preached to them, and 
at the end of the sermon they all became arahants. BuA.128-9.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Arindama.</b>-King of Uttara. When Revata 
Buddha visited his city the king went to see him, accompanied by three crores of 
people. The next day a great almsgiving was held for the Buddha and the monks, 
and also a festival of light covering a space of three leagues. The Buddha 
preached to the assembly, and one thousand crores of people realised the Truth. 
Bu.vi.4; BuA.133.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Arindama</b>.-A king of forty-one kappas 
ago; a former birth of Sannidhāpaka Thera. Ap.i.97.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Arindama.</b>-King of Hamsavatī. When the 
king, through carelessness, had lost his wealth, his setthi (Jatukannika in a 
former birth) made good the loss by giving him the seven kinds of jewels. 
Ap.ii.360.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Arindama.</b>-The name given to the Cakkavatti’s cakkaratana because it brings all his enemies into subjection.
