<p><b>1. Yasa Thera. </b>He was the son of a very wealthy 
treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three 
mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures. 
Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his 
sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left 
the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the 
direction of Isipatana, exclaiming: “Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!” 
The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, “Come Yasa, here is 
neither distress nor danger.” Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and 
sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and 
when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the 
Dhamma. To Yasa’s father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha 
preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. (This is given 
as an example of the Buddha’s iddhi power, Vsm.393).&nbsp; At the end of the 
sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha’s follower, (he thus became the first 
tevācika upāsaka) and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, 
therefore, Yasa’s presence became known to his father, who asked him to return 
to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no 
attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The 
next day, at the invitation of Yasa’s father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to 
his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa’s 
mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus 
becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā. When Yasa’s intimate friends, Vimala, 
Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa’s ordination they followed his 
example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty 
others of Yasa’s former friends and acquaintances (Vin.i.15 20; DhA.i.72).</p>
<p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha, Yasa was a king of the 
Nāgas and invited the Buddha and his monks to his abode, where he showed them 
great honour and hospitality. He then gave costly robes to the Buddha and to 
each monk a pair of valuable robes. In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a 
Treasurer, and offered the seven kinds of jewels at the Bodhi tree. In the time 
of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk. For eighteen thousand kappas he was a deva king 
and one thousand times he was king of men. Wherever he went he had a gold 
canopy, and in his last life over his funeral pyre was a gold canopy 
(ThagA.i.232f). He is evidently identical with Sabbadāyaka of the Apadāna 
(Ap.i.333f). A verse attributed to him is found in the Theragāthā (vs.117).</p>
<p>Yasa is often quoted as one who enjoyed great luxury in 
his lay life (AA.ii.596).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.82f ) states that, in a 
past life, Yasa and his four companions wandered about engaged in various acts 
of social service. One day they came across the dead body of a pregnant woman, 
which they took to the cemetery to be cremated. There the others went away, 
leaving Yasa to finish the work. While burning the corpse his mind was filled 
with thoughts of the foulness of the human body; he drew the attention of his 
friends to this idea, and, later, of his parents and wives, all of whom approved 
of what he said. For this reason Yasa felt revulsion against the household life, 
and his friends and members of his family were able to realize the Dhamma early 
in the Buddha’s career.</p>
<p>The ordination of Yasa was one of the scenes of the 
Buddha’s life to be sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa 
(Mhv.xxx.79).</p>
<p>According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.218f), Sujātā 
Senānīdhītā (who gave the Buddha a meal of milk rice just before his 
Enlightenment) was Yasa’s mother. She became a sotāpanna after listening to the 
Buddha’s sermon.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Yasa. </b>Called <b>Kākandakaputta</b></p>
<p>He was the son of 
the brahmin Kākandaka and was a pupil of Ānanda. It is said he was fortunate 
enough to see the Buddha alive (Mhv.iv.57f).  </p>
<p>When he arrived at the <a href="kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm" title="ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa.htm">Kūtāgārasālā</a> 
in the <a href="mahavana.htm" title="maha/mahavana.htm">Mahāvana</a>, he discovered that the 
<a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjian</a> monks had raised the “Ten 
Points” (dasavatthu) contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were 
publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested 
against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, 
offered him a share of the money they had collected.  </p>
<p>This offer he rejected with 
scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patisārattiyakamma (craving of pardon 
from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, 
accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having 
misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the 
behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid 
down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.  </p>
<p>When 
the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniya Kamma 
(Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared 
through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, 
of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhināpatha), asking 
for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he 
visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult 
<a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Revata</a> who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him 
through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found 
Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him 
promise of assistance.  </p>
<p>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, 
the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an 
assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed (to settle the 
matter by an Ubbāhikā) of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sālha, Khujjasobhita, 
and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and 
Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner 
and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision 
was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was 
conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven 
hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī. 
Vin.ii.294ff.; Mhv.iv.9ff.;; Dpv.iv.45ff.; v.23. The Mhv. says that at first the 
king (Kālāsoka) was inclined to support the Vajjians, but his sister, Nandā 
Therī, warned him against this (iv. 37ff.).</p>
<p>The monks who refused to accept the findings of the 
committee held another convocation, which was called the Mahāsangīti 
(Dpv.v.30ff.). The Sattasatī Recital (also called The Second Recital) was also 
named (E.g., AA.i.251; MA.ii.880) Yasathera sangīti, evidently because of the 
prominent part played by Yasa.</p>
<p>Yasa is ranked (See, e.g., DA.ii.525) among the great 
benefactors of the religion.</p>
