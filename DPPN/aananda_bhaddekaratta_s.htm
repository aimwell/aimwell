</ul>
<p>Preached at <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a>. Ānanda discourses 
to the assembled monks on the nature of the True Saint- (Bhaddekaratta). The 
Buddha appears on the scene and on being told of Ānanda’s discourse, asks him 
how exactly he had proceeded. Ānanda repeats to him the 
<a href="bhaddekaratta_s.htm" title="b/bhaddekaratta_s.htm">Bhaddekaratta Sutta</a>, 
which he had previously learnt from the Buddha. </p>
<p>The Buddha recites it himself from 
beginning to end and praises Ānanda for his skill. M.iii.189-91.</p>
