<p><b>1. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa Thera.</b>-He once 
went to <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> with twenty-nine of his friends from 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> to make offerings 
to the Buddha. Having heard the Buddha’s preaching, they all became monks. After 
five years' residence with their teachers, they wished to retire into solitude 
and obtained from the Buddha topics for their meditations. While on the way to 
the forest, Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa weakened in his determination and turned back. 
When the rains were over, the others, having won arahantship, returned and 
reported their various attainments to the Buddha. Kutumbiyaputta heard the 
Buddha praise them, and made up his mind to follow their example and so to go 
back with them the next day to the forest. That same night, however, filled with 
a yearning not to delay in beginning his austerities, he slept in an upright 
posture; but in the middle of the night he fell down and broke his thighbone. 
This accident delayed the departure of the other monks, and the Buddha, hearing 
of it, blamed Tissa for his unseasonable zeal and related the 
<a href="varana_jat_071.htm" title="va/varana_jat_071.htm">Varana Jātaka</a>, 
showing how, in the past too, he had behaved similarly (J.i.316f).</p>
<p>The Commentaries lead us to believe 
(E.g., SA.ii.216; AA.i.29; see also Padhānakammika-Tissa) that Kutumbiyaputta 
did ultimately attain arahantship, for he is mentioned several times with 
<a href="pitimalla.htm" title="pu/pitimalla.htm">Pitimalla</a> and others as an example of one who put forth great exertion while 
suffering severe pain, in order to win his goal.</p>

<p><b>2. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa.</b>-An arahant. He 
lived in Piyangudīpa. Dutthagāmani, fleeing from the battle at Cūlanganiyapitthi, 
wished to give a share of his food to a monk before sitting down to eat. When 
the meal-time was announced, the thera Gotama, hearing it with his divine ear, 
sent Kutumbiyaputta to receive the share set apart for the brotherhood 
(Mhv.xxiv.22ff; xxxii.31f). It transpired later that the food so received was 
divided by Kutumbiyaputta among twelve thousand monks in Piyangudīpa.
