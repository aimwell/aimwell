<p>One of the three chief consorts of King 
<a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>.  </p>
<p>She was the 
daughter of the setthi <a href="bhaddavatiya.htm" title="b/bhaddavatiya.htm">Bhaddavatiya</a> of 
<a href="bhaddavatii.htm" title="b/bhaddavatii.htm">Bhaddavatī</a>, who was a friend of 
<a href="ghosaka_setthi.htm" title="g/ghosaka_setthi.htm">Ghosaka</a> 
of <a href="kosambii.htm" title="ku/kosambii.htm">Kosambī</a>. When plague broke out in Bhaddavatī, she and her parents fled to 
Kosambī, and there obtained food from the alms hall provided by Ghosaka. On the 
first day Sāmāvatī asked for three portions, on the second two, on the third 
only one. For her father had died after the meal on the first day, her mother on 
the second. When, on the third day, she asked for only one portion, 
<a href="mitta.htm" title="me_mu/mitta.htm">Mitta</a> who 
was distributing alms, teased her, saying: “Today you know the capacity of your 
belly.” She asked what he meant, and when he explained his words, she told him 
what had happened. Mitta pitied her and adopted her as his daughter.</p>
<p>One day, when she arrived at the refectory, she found a 
great uproar going on, people rushing everywhere to get alms. She asked to be 
allowed to bring order into this chaos, and had a fence erected round the 
refectory with separate doors for entrance and exit. This put an end to the 
disturbances. Ghosaka, hearing no noise in the refectory as before, inquired the 
reason, and, finding out what Sāmāvatī had done, adopted her as his own child. 
Sāmāvatī’s original name was Sāmā, but after building the fence (vati) round the 
refectory she was called Sāmāvatī.</p>
<p>On a festival day Udena saw Sāmāvatī going to the river to 
bathe, and, falling in love with her, asked Ghosaka to send her to the palace. 
But Ghosaka refused, and the king turned him and his wife out of doors and 
sealed up his house. When Sāmāvatī discovered this, she made Ghosaka send her to 
the palace, and Udena made her his chief consort. Some time afterwards Udena 
took <a href="maagandiyaa.htm" title="ma/maagandiyaa.htm">Māgandiyā</a> also as consort.</p>
<p>When the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> visited Kosambī at the request of
<a href="ghosaka_setthi.htm" title="g/ghosaka_setthi.htm">Ghosaka</a>, 
<a href="kukkuta.htm" title="ku/kukkuta.htm">Kukkuta</a> and Pāvāriya, 
<a href="khujjuttaraa.htm" title="ku/khujjuttaraa.htm">Khujjutarā</a>, the servant woman of Sāmāvatī, heard him 
preach and became a Sotāpanna. She had been on her way to the gardener, Sumana, 
to buy flowers for Sāmāvatī, with the eight pieces of money given to her daily 
by the king for this purpose. On Sumana’s invitation, she had gone to hear the 
Buddha at his house. On other days she had spent only half the money on flowers, 
appropriating the rest for herself; but this day, having become a Sotāpanna, she 
bought flowers with the whole amount and took them to Sāmāvatī, to whom she 
confessed her story. At Sāmāvatī’s request, Khujjuttarā repeated to her and her 
companions the sermon she had heard from the Buddha. After this, she visited the 
Buddha daily, repeating his sermon to Sāmāvatī and her friends. Having learnt 
that the Buddha passed along the street in which the palace stood, Sāmāvatī had 
holes made in the walls so that she and her friends might see the Buddha and do 
obeisance to him. Māgandiyā heard of this during a visit to Sāmāvatī’s quarters, 
and, because of her hatred for the Buddha, she determined to have Sāmāvatī 
punished. For details see <a href="maagandiyaa.htm" title="ma/maagandiyaa.htm">Māgandiyā</a>.</p>
<p>At first her plots miscarried, and Udena, convinced of 
Sāmāvatī’s goodness, gave her a boon, and she chose that the Buddha be invited 
to visit the palace daily and to preach to her and her friends. But the Buddha 
sent <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> instead, and they provided him with food every day and listened to 
the Law. One day they presented him with five hundred robes given to them by the 
king, who, at first, was very angry; but on hearing from Ānanda that nothing 
given to the monks was lost, he gave another five hundred robes himself.</p>
<p>In the end, Māgandiyā’s plot succeeded, and Sāmāvatī and 
her companions were burned to death in their own house. Udena was in his park, 
and, on his arrival, he found them all dead. When the Buddha was asked, he said 
that sonic of the women had attained to the First Fruit of the Path, others to 
the second, yet others to the third. It is said that in a previous birth 
Sāmāvatī and her friends had belonged to the harem of the king of Benares. One 
day they went bathing with the king, and, feeling cold when they came out of the 
water, they set fire to a tangle of grass, near by. When the grass burned down, 
they found a Pacceka Buddha seated in the tangle, and fearing that they had 
burnt him to death, they pulled more grass, which they placed round his body, 
and, after pouring oil on it, set fire to it so that all traces of their crime 
might be destroyed. The Pacceka Buddha was in samādhi and nothing could 
therefore harm him, but it was this act which brought retribution to Sāmāvatī 
and her companions. </p>
<p>The story of Sāmāvatī is included in the story cycle of 
Udena. For details see especially DhA.i.187 91, 205 225; the story also appears, 
with certain variations in detail, in AA.i.232 4, 236ff., and is given very 
briefly in UdA.382f., omitting the account of the reason for Sāmāvatī’s death 
which is given at length in an explanation of an <a href="udaana.htm" title="u/udaana.htm">Udāna</a> (Ud.vii.10) dealing with 
the incident. Cf. Dvy.575f. According to the Visuddhi Magga (p.380f), Māgandiyā’s desire to kill Sāmāvatī arose from her desire to be herself chief 
queen.</p>
<p>The two Therī’s named <a href="samaa.htm" title="sa/samaa.htm">Sāmā</a> were friends of Sāmāvatī, and were so filled with grief over her death that they left home and 
joined the Order.</p>
<p>Sāmāvatī is reckoned among the moist eminent of the lay 
women who were followers of the Buddha, and was declared by him foremost among 
those who lived in kindliness (aggam mettāvihārinam) (A.i.26; cf. iv.348).</p>
<p>Her iddhi, in warding off the arrow shot at her by Udena, 
is often referred to. E.g. BuA.24; ItA.23; PSA.498; AA.ii.791.</p>
