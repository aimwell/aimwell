<p>Once Brahmadatta, king of Benares, captured Kosala with 
its king, and brought all its treasures to Benares, where he buried them in iron 
pots in the royal park. Chatta, the Kosala king’s son, escaped, and became an 
ascetic near Takkasilā with a following of five hundred. Later he came with his 
followers to Benares, won the heart of the king by his demeanour, and lived in 
the royal park. There, by means of a spell, he discovered the buried treasure, 
and taking his followers into his confidence, took the treasure to Sāvatthi and 
made the city impregnable. When Brahmadatta discovered his loss and its results, 
he was disconsolate, but was comforted by his minister, who was the Bodhisatta, 
and who pointed out to him that Chatta had but taken what belonged to him.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a knavish monk, 
identified with Chatta. J.iii.115ff.</p>
