  <h2>Godha or Mahānāma Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mahānāma visits Godha the Sākiyan at 
Kapilavatthu and asks him what qualities, possessed by a  
Sotāpanna, will secure 
for him ultimate enlightenment. There are three, answers Godha-unwavering 
loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. When Godha, in his turn, asks 
the same question of Mahānāma, the latter answers that there are four, and adds 
the possession of Āriyan virtues.  </p>
<p>The two seek the Buddha to ask his opinion. Mahānāma declares to the Buddha that he would accept the Buddha’s decision in 
face of the opinion of everyone else in the universe. In answer to a question of 
the Buddha, Godha answers that of a person who holds such a view he has nothing 
but good to say, the conclusion evidently being that he accepts Mahānāma’s 
opinion in preference to his own. S.v.371f.</p>
