<p>1. Anurādha.-An Elder. Once when he was 
staying in a forest hut in the Mahāvana in Vesāli, near to where the Buddha was, 
certain wandering ascetics came to him and asked him whether or not a Tathāgata 
exists after death; dissatisfied with his answer they called him “fool” and went 
away. Thereupon Anurādha sought advice from the Buddha, who asked him “How, 
inasmuch as it cannot be said of a Tathāgata even in this very life that he 
really exists, can anything be said regarding him after death?”</p>
<p>S.iii.116-19; the same story is 
repeated, with slight expansions, in S.iv.380-6.</p>
<p>2. Anurādha.-One of those that 
accompanied Vijaya to Ceylon. He later became one of his ministers and founded 
Anurādhagāma. Mhv.vii.43.</p>
<p>3. Anurādha.-A Sākiya prince, brother of 
Bhaddakaccāna; a great uncle of Pandukabhaya. He founded a settlement at 
Anurādhagāma and constructed a tank, to the south of which he erected a house 
for himself. Later he handed this over to Pandukābhaya. Mhv.vii.43-4.</p>
