<h4>1. Pingiyānī</h4>
<p>A brahmin of Vesāli. The Anguttara Nikāya records a 
conversation between him and Kāranapāli. The latter meets Pingiyānī and, on 
learning that he was returning from a visit to the Buddha, asks him about the 
Buddha’s wisdom. Pingiyāni utters the Buddha’s praises with a wealth of simile 
and metaphor. Kāranapāli is impressed, and declares himself the Buddha’s 
follower (A.iii.236ff). On another occasion, Pingiyāni is present when five 
hundred Licchavis come to pay honour to the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā. The 
sight of the Buddha, sitting in their midst, outshining them all, inspires 
Pingiyāni and he bursts into song. The Licchavis give him five hundred upper 
garments, all of which he presents to the Buddha. Ibid., 239f.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.636) that Pingiyānī was an 
anāgāmī. He went daily to the Buddha, with flowers and perfumes. See also 
<a href="pingiya.htm" title="pu/pingiya.htm">Pingiya</a> (3).</p>

<h4>2. Pingiyānī</h4>
<p>Wife of Brahmadatta. One day when opening her window she 
saw a royal groom, with whom she fell in love, and when the king fell asleep, 
she climbed down through the window, lay with the groom, and climbed back again, 
after which she perfumed herself and lay down beside the king. The king 
eventually discovered her misdemeanour and proclaimed it to his ministers, 
depriving her of her royal rank.</p>
<p>The story is one of those related by Kunāla, who is 
identified with <a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a> (J.v.444). It is perhaps this story which is 
referred to as the <a href="culla_kunaala_jat_464.htm" title="c/culla_kunaala_jat_464.htm">Culla Kunāla Jātaka</a>.</p>

<h4>Pingiyānī Sutta</h4>
<p>The story of the brahmin Pingiyānī (q.v.) uttering the 
Buddha’s praises before the Licchavis. When Pingiyānī ended his song of praise, 
the Buddha told the Licchavis of the five kinds of rare treasures: the 
Tathāgata, one who can teach the Dhammavinaya, one who recognises the Dhamma, 
one who follows the Dhamma, and one who is grateful. A.iii.239 ff.</p>
