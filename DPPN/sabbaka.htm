<p>An arahant Thera. He belonged to a brahmin family of 
Sāvatthi, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. He lived in 
Lonagiri vihāra (v.l. Lena vihāra), on the banks of the 
<a href="ajakaranii.htm" title="am/ajakaranii.htm">Ajakaranī</a>, practising 
meditation, and, in due course, won arahantship. He visited Sāvatthi to worship 
the Buddha, and stayed there a few days, entertained by his kinsfolk. When he 
wished to return to his dwelling they begged him to stay and be supported by 
them, but he refused because he loved retirement. The verses he spoke on this 
occasion are given in Thag.vs.307 10.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago he was a Nāga king of great power 
who, having seen the Pacceka Buddha Sambhavaka, wrapt in samādhi, under the open 
sky, remained beside him holding a lotus over his head (ThagA.i.399f).</p>
<p>He is probably to be identified with Padumapūjaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.279 f ; cf. Ap.ii.453f. (Padumudhāriya).</p>
