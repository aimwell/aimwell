<p><img src="hsuen_tsang.jpg" HSPACE=5 Border=5 ALIGN="LEFT">A well known Chinese monk who visited 
India and traversed a large number of countries covering more than 50,000 Li. 
Though the dangers that he encountered were many he fulfilled his main objective 
undaunted by them. His contribution to the cause of Buddhism in general and to 
the Great Vehicle in particular is immense. For these and many other reasons he 
is held by the Chinese Buddhists in the highest esteem among the pilgrims of his 
calibre.
<br>
<br>
The following information on HsÅ«an-tsangâ€™s travels and his accounts of India and other countries which he travelled in his long journey is based mainly on two sources, namely, â€œSi-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western Worldâ€ an English translation of the Chinese 
version of HsÅ«an-tsang and â€œThe Life of Hiuen-tsiangâ€ an English translation of 
his biography written in Chinese by Shaman Hwui-li, a disciple of his. Among 
secondary sources the most useful treatise is 'On Yuan Chwangâ€™s Travels in 
India', a critical study written by Thomas Watters in 1961. This work is based 
on HsÅ«an-tsangâ€™s Hsi-Yu-Shi (or Si-Yu-Ki) also entitled Buddhist Records of the 
Western World.
<br>
<br>
HsÅ«an-tsang was born in 603 A.C. in Chin-lu in the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty and lived about sixty-five years. Opinions, however, differ regarding the exact years of his 
birth and death. His secular name was Ch'en-Chin and he was the youngest of four 
brothers. His father was Ch'en-hui who devoted himself to the study of 
Confucious' teachings. Even as a child HsÅ«an-tsang was unusually of grave 
temperament and intelligence. He did not enjoy the company of boys of his age 
nor did he appreciate their life style. His second brother, Chang-tse who had 
entered the Order previously took HsÅ«an-tsang to his own convent and made 
arrangements to impart instruction to him there.</p>
<p>HsÅ«an-tsang (= Ht.) was so studious that 
at times he studied without sleep and even food. At one hearing he is said to 
have comprehended a book thoroughly and after a second reading needed no further 
instruction. At the age of eleven he was versed in the Saddharmapundarika Sutra 
and the Vimalakirtinirdesa. At the age of thirteen he was admitted into the 
Order and was engaged in further studies.
<br>
<br>
<p>The political situation in the country 
being unsatisfactory the two brothers went to Chang'an and from there again to 
Ch'eng-tu, the capital of Shu. There HsÅ«an-tsang followed lectures on the 
scriptures delivered by eminent scholars and in a few years he mastered the 
scriptures of various schools and earned a name as a scholar. It was about this 
time or a few years later that he came to be known by the appellation â€œThe 
Master of the Lawâ€œ.</p>
<p>In the fifth year of Wu-te he received 
full ordination at Ch'eng-tu. He went to Chin-chow for further studies where he 
also conducted sermons as an advanced student. Scholar monks who gathered there 
as listeners treated him with great respect and admiration. Thereupon he went to 
Chaochow, Hsiang-chow and Ch'ang-an and studied the SamyuktÄbhidharma-hrdaya, 
the MahÄyÄna-sangraha, the Abhidharma-kosa etc.</p>
<p>In a short time Ht. mastered all the 
theories of the different schools of Buddhism and was acclaimed as a great 
scholar. He found that Buddhist teachings he had learned, mainly those concerned 
with the theory of Dharmalaksana and the views held by the propounders of the 
MahÄyÄna-Sangraha and those held by the followers of the DasabhÅ«mivyÄkarana were 
at variance. Moreover, he discerned many defects in the Chinese translations of 
the sacred books, and consequently he cherished the idea of going to India to 
learn at the feet of orthodox scholars. In this he was inspired to some extent 
by his forerunners Fa-hsien and Chi-yen who undertook similar tasks.</p>
<p>Overcoming many obstacles Ht., at the 
age of twenty-six years set forth from Chang-an and going through several 
provinces or countries came to Liang-chow where he received a companion to 
travel to the West. Despite the attempts of spies to detain him the governor of 
the province, Li-chiang, however, let him proceed on his journey. Some of the 
territories or countries which he traversed until he reached the borders of 
North India were Turfan (Kau-chang), Agni (O-ki-ni), Kuche (Kiuchi) an oasis in 
the Gobi desert, Nujkend (Nu-chin-kien), Chaf (Che-shi), Ferghanah (Fei-han in 
Turkestan), Sutrishna (Su-tu-Ii-sse-na), Samarkhand (Sa-mo-kien), Kesh (Ki-shwang-na), 
Kunduz (Hwo), Bhaktra or Bactria (Fo-ho-lo), Bamiyam (Fan-yen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she).</p>
<p>His journey was beset with dangers and 
hardships. As the only guide given him to accompany until the last of the watch 
towers in sandy desert also deserted him he went on all alone. The worst 
experience encountered was in the heart of the Mo-kia-yen desert which extended 
for 800 li. One hundred li after entering the desert he lost his way. By 
accident his water bag gave way without leaving a drop of water in it and he had 
to spend four nights and five days in the desert without water.</p>
<p>At a later stage when wending their way 
up the snow-clad Ling mountain, and the snowy mountain (Hindukush) lying to the 
south of Balkh, twelve or fourteen of his companions and an even greater number 
of oxen and horses met with death.</p>
<p>Obstacles caused by robbers on his way 
to India and also in India itself were more than embarrassing. Even governors or 
kings of certain countries embarrassed him as he was proceeding towards India. 
Although very hospitable and respectful to Ht. the king of Kam-chang, 
Khio-wen-tai planned to detain him in his court as his spiritual head. Ht. got 
out of this grip only by the threat of fasting unto death. Another attempt to 
detain him was made by the Great Khan of the Turks. As will appear below, Ht. 
underwent another such experience in Eastern India as well.</p>
<p>Of the countries which were traversed by 
Ht. on his way to North India, Bhaktra (Po-ho-lo), Bamiyan (Fanyen-na) and 
Kapisa (Kia-pi-she) were active centres of Buddhism. According to Ht, there were 
about three thousand monks of the Little Vehicle in Bhaktra. There was a scholar 
monk called PrajÃ±Äkara who was versed in the three pitakas of the Little 
Vehicle. Ht. was pleased with his explanation of the doctrine of that school.</p>
<p>Ht. reached Bamiyan crossing Hindu-kush. 
In both Bamiyan and Kapisa, there were several thousand monks of the Little 
Vehicle. In Bamiyan there were three imposing figures of the Buddha. One of 
these was a standing figure of about 140 or 150 feet high. Another figure of the 
standing Buddha measures 100 feet in height. An enormous figure of the recumbent 
Buddha depicting his 'Nirvana' measures 1000 feet in length.</p>
<p>At a conference held in a temple of the 
Great Vehicle in Kapisa Ht. being thorough with the teachings of both schools, 
proved his superiority over all who participated in it. From Kapisa onwards his 
itinerary covered territories in North India of which the following place names 
are graphed by Ht. into a separate unit. Lamghan (Lanpo), Nagarahara (Na-kie-to-ho), 
Gandhara (Kien-to-lo), Udyana (U-chang), Takshasila (Ta-ch'a-shi-lo), Urasa 
(Wu-la-sa), Kashmir (Kia-shi-mi-lo), Punach (Pun-nuh-tâ€™so) and Rajapuri 
(Ho-lo-she-pu-lo). According to Ht, common people in the above territories 
differ to some extent from those of India in respect of manners, clothing and 
language.</p>
<p>Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the 
Western World (Records) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1981, Bk. II, pp. 68, 917; 
The Life of Hiuen Tsiang (=The Life) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1973, pp. 
57-72. The countries from Lamgham to Rajapuri both inclusive were not regarded 
by the people of India proper as forming parts of their territory (Watters, 
Thomas, On Yuang Chwangâ€™s Travels in India, pub. Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, 
Oriental Publishers and Booksellers, Delhi, 1961, p. 180, (Abbreviated as 
Watters).</p>
<p>Nagarahara (Jelalabad) occupies a 
prominent place as a country possessing Buddhaâ€™s relics. In Nagarahara or its 
neighbourhood Ht. rejoined his companions and went to Gandhara by the Khyber 
Pass. He gives the names of a number of sages and saints who composed sÄstras 
there. Then he goes to describe the famous stupa of 400 feet in height ascribed 
to king Kanishka. It was situated in Purushapura (Po-lu-shu-po-lo), the capital 
of Gandhara.</p>
<p>Either side of the river Subhavastu (Su-po-fa-sa-tu) 
in the country of Udyana is said by Ht. to have been thickly populated by 
Buddhists in former days. At the time of his visit he saw the country 
depopulated. The few monks who were there at the time belonged to five different 
schools viz. the Dharmaguptas, the MahisÄsakas, the Kasyapiyas, the 
SarvÄstivadins and the MahÄsanghikas. Among the objects of worship are mentioned 
figures of Avalokitesvara and Maitreya bodhisattva.</p>
<p>In Takshasila, Urasa and Kashmir, too, 
he saw various Buddhist sites. The chief monk in Kashmir was of high moral 
character and of remarkable intelligence. This monk explained many parts of the 
doctrine to him. This learned teacher was so impressed by Ht. that the latter 
was compared to Asanga bodhisattva in respect of his wisdom. According to Ht.
<a href="kaniska.htm" title="ka/kaniska.htm">Kanishka</a>, convened an assembly, known to history 
as the Fourth Council, in the four hundredth year from the 'Nirvana' of the 
TathÄgata. Ht. stayed for two years studying sutras and sÄstras.</p>
<p>Leaving Kashmir Ht. made his way to 
Punach and from there to Rajapuri. From Rajapuri he entered a different zone in 
North India arriving at Takka (Teheka) as its starting point. To the east of the 
town called Narasimha (Na-lo-sang-ho) he and the accompanying sÄmaneras 
encountered a band of fifty robbers who robbed them of their belongings. 
However, a brahmin in the neighbourhood came to their help and they managed to 
escape with no loss of life. There he remained for one month, and for fourteen 
months in the kingdom of Chinapati (Chi-na-po-tai) studying various texts.</p>
<p>Before reaching the next important 
kingdom, Mathura (Mo-t'u-lo) he passed through the kingdoms of Jalandhara (She-lan-t'o-lo), 
Kuluta (Kiu-la-ta), Satadra (Shete-to-lu) and Paryatra (Po-li-ye-to-to). An 
interesting custom of making offerings in honour of the disciples of the Buddha 
is said to have prevailed in Mathura. The followers of Abhidhamma made offerings 
in honour of SÄriputta, those who practised meditation....... in honour of 
MaudgalyÄyana, the students of the sutras...... in honour of 
PurnamaitrÄyaniputra, the followers of the Vinaya..... in honour of UpÄli, the 
bhikkhunis..... in honour of Ä€nanda, the SrÄmaneras.... in honour of RÄhula and 
followers of the Great Vehicle.... in honour of bodhisattvas (Watters, pp. 302, 
303; The Life, p. 77).</p>
<p>After Mathura he visited Matipuram (Ma-ti-pu-lo) 
which was ruled by a king of the SÅ«dra caste. He makes reference to Gunaprabha 
the author of Tattvavibhanga SÄstra and to a learned doctor called Sanghabbadra 
who was versed in the VibhÄsÄ of the SarvistivÄda school and who composed the 
Kosa-kÄrikÄ. Ht. stayed there for a few months and studied various texts under 
the eminent monk called Mitrasena.</p>
<p>On his way to Kapitha (Kis-pi-tha) also 
called Sankassa he had to go past Brahmapura (P'o-lo-hih-mo-pu-lo), Ahikshetra 
('O-hi-shi-to-lo) and VirÄsana (Pi-to-shanna). Proceeding two hundred li towards 
north-west from Kapitha he reached Kanauj or KÄnyakubja (Kie-jo-kio-she-kwo). 
Its capital borders on the Ganges on the West. </p>
<p>Watters argues that the direction shown 
in the text is wrong and it should be South East. He also argues that the river 
in question is not the Ganges but a tributary of that river (Waiters, p. 340; 
cp. also Records, Bk. V. p. 207.</p>
<p>It was a busy centre of Buddhism and 
there were ten thousand monks who studied both vehicles very ardently. His 
account on Harsavardhana or Harsha also called SilÄditya is of immense 
historical value.</p>
<p>Countries from AyodhyÄ (O-yo-t'o) to 
Hiranya parvata (I-lam-na-po-fa-to) constitute another phase of his long 
pilgrimage. Six hundred li to the south-east from Kanauj is Ayodhya. Several 
thousand monks there studied both vehicles, and it is here that Vasubandhu and 
Asanga carried out their literary activities. When Ht. and his companions were 
going from Ayodhya to Hayamukha ('O-ye-mu-khi) along the course of the Ganges a 
gang of pirates took the crew captive. As worshippers of goddess Durga the 
pirates were looking out for a man of good form and comely features for 
sacrificing to the goddess. They earmarked Ht. as the most suitable person for 
the purpose and were about to kill him. Suddenly a typhoon arose smiting down 
the trees. Clouds of sand flew on every side and the lashing waves of the river 
tossed the boats to and fro. The pirates getting terrified at the calamity 
thought that it all happened due to the spiritual power of Ht, and came down in 
repentance and confessed their fault.</p>
<p>After this nasty experience Ht. went to 
Hayamukha and from there to PrayÄga (Po-lo-ye-kia). He describes PrayÄga, the 
confluence of two rivers, GangÄ and YamunÄ and the level ground of about 
fourteen li in circuit, to the West. From PrayÄga he set out for Kausambi (Kiau-shang-mi) 
where he saw many sanghÄramas, stÅ«pas and a sandalwood image of the Buddha 
fashioned by king Udayana. According to Ht, there were about three thousand 
monks belonging to the Sammitiya school of the Little Vehicle in the Kingdom of 
VisÄkha (Pi-so-kia).</p>
<p>In SrÄvasti, the next important Buddhist 
centre he visited, there were several hundred sanghÄrÄmas belonging to the 
Sammitiya school. Sites connected with various incidents are described: for 
instance, the spot on which AngulimÄla gave up his evil acts and was converted, 
the convent where BrahmacÄri heretics killed a woman and accused the Buddha of 
her murder, the venue in which the Buddha defeated all the heretics, the place 
where the Buddha met his father, king Suddhodana, for the first time since 
Enlightenment and so on.</p>
<p>From SrÄvasti he went to Kapilavastu (Kie-pi-lo-fa-sutu) 
where the capital as well as some thousand villages were in a state of ruin. 
There he saw old foundations of the main palace of Suddhodana and the sleeping 
quarters of Queen MÄyÄ etc. HsÅ«an-tsangâ€™s account of Kapilavastu and Kusinagara 
(Kushi-na-kie-lo) or KusinÄrÄ is replete with accounts of the life of the Buddha 
before and after his Enlightenment, for example the place of his birth, 
prophetic pronouncement, sites of the Four Signs, ParinirvÄna etc. According to 
Ht. the contemporary tradition has it that the Buddhaâ€™s Nirvina' took place on 
the fifteenth day of the latter half of the month of VaisÄkha. The 
SarvÄstivÄdins held that it took place during the second half of the month of 
KÄrtika i.e. November.</p>
<p>Referring to the kingdom of Banaras or 
BÄrÄnasi (Po-lo-ni-sse) he speaks of two schools of monks, one belonging to the 
SarvÄstivÄda and the other to the Sammitiya school both belonging to the Little 
Vehicle. Important sites such as the venue of the Buddhaâ€™s first sermon and his 
washing tank are mentioned in his account.</p>
<p>From BÄrÄnasi he went to Ghazipur (Chen-chu) 
and then to VaisÄli. There the capital city was in a state of devastation and 
ruin. The inhabitants at the time of his visit were very few in number. In a 
sanghÄrÄma there the Buddha is said to have recited the Vimalakirti Sutra. Three 
important places relating to his Parinirvana are also mentioned.</p>
<p>On his way to Magadha (Mo-kie-to) he 
stopped at the town of Svetapura where he obtained the sÅ«tra called the 
Bodhisattva-pitaka. He had a high esteem for the people of Magadha. According to 
him there were about ten thousand monks mostly belonging to the Great Vehicle in 
Magadha. The capital of Magadha was desolate and in ruins. According to Ht. 
Asoka held a convocation of a thousand monks at a monastery called KukkutÄrÄma. 
This is an allusion to the Third Council held under the patronage of King Asoka. 
The monastery in question is named as AsokÄrÄma in the Dipavamsa and the 
MahÄvamsa, the two ancient Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Referring to NairaÃ±jÄna and other 
important sites at BodhgayÄ he mentions various beliefs regarding the VajrÄsana. 
One such belief holds that the site of the VajrÄsana was the centre of the 
universe. He says that the Bo-tree had been continually cut down and destroyed 
by the members of the royalty. Elsewhere he refers to one king named SasÄnka of 
Karnasuvarna in Eastern India who destroyed the Bo-tree (Records Bk. viii, p. 
121). The following account of Ht. regarding the Bo-tree seems interesting in 
respect of rituals which developed in later times. â€œThe Bo-tree sheds its leaves 
when the day of the Nirvana approaches and tender leaves begin to grow after 
this day. Every year on that day kings, ministers and magistrates pour milk on 
its roots, light lamps, scatter flowers and they go away collecting leaves.</p>
<p>The account on the NÄlandÄ monastery 
gives some idea about its academic activities, maintenance, academic staff and 
student population, curriculum and residential quarters. It says that after the 
â€œNirvanaâ€ of the Buddha an old king of that country called SakrÄditya built this 
convent out of his great attachment for the Buddha. By the time of Ht.â€™s visit 
it had been about 700 years since its establishment. Thus its founding dates 
back to 1st century B.C.</p>
<p>His purpose of going to NÄlandÄ was to 
learn the principles of the Yoga-sastra, The chief monk Silabhadra admitted Ht. 
as his disciple. Among the students there were many foreigners. According to Ht. 
of all the sanghÄrÄmas of India NÄlandÄ Monastery was the most remarkable for 
its grandeur and height. Resident students numbered ten thousand. They studied 
the teachings of all the eighteen schools and also subjects such as the Vedas, 
the HetuvidyÄ, SabdavidyÄ, the CikitsÄvidyÄ, the works on magic (Atharvaveda) 
and the SÄnkhya system. There were 1541 scholars who were versed in various 
branches of study. Within the temple hundred pupils were being arranged every 
day for preaching and students attended these and participated in discussions 
without fail.</p>
<p>As for the source of income of the 
NÄlandÄ monastery Ht. tells us that there was a farm-house belonging to the 
monastery. The account does not say anything about the way in which the farm was 
run and how the income accrued to the monastery. There were other sources of 
income too. According to Ht. the king of the country remitted the revenue of 
about hundred villages for the endowment of the convent. Two hundred house 
holders in these villages contributed rice, butter and milk daily. Hence 
students had no complaints to make about their requisites.</p>
<p>In RÄjagrha he locates many important 
sites connected with various episodes; for instance, the site of the stupa where 
Devadatta in conjunction with AjÄtasatru rÄjÄ let loose the drunken elephant 
with intent to kill the Buddha. Referring to the GrdhrakÅ«ta (Ki-li-to-lo-kiu) it 
is said that while residing there the Buddha declared the Saddharmapundarika (Fa-hwa), 
the MahÄprajÃ±Ä (Tapan-jo) and numerous other Sutras.</p>
<p>His account on the First Council held in 
RÄjagrha is rather misleading. It appears that he has incorporated into it 
certain details which deal with later councils. According to Ht. the collection 
of scriptures authorised by the Council came to be called Sthavira collection 
because KÄsyapa (MahÄ Kassapa) officiated as the president of the assembly. As 
regards the emergence of the MahÄsanghika school Ht. informs us that monks who 
were excluded from the Council held by MahÄ KÄsyapa assembled in RÄjagrha and 
made a collection of the doctrine in five Pitakas, the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya 
Pitaka, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the DhÄrani Pitaka. 
How this assembly got the name MahÄsanghika is explained as follows: â€œAs in this 
assembly there were ordinary persons (Fan-fu) and holy men it was called the 
Convocation of the MahÄsanghikas (The Life, p. 117 cp. Dipavamsa, H. Oldenberg, 
New Delhi, 1982, 5,30).</p>
<p>Having visited sacred places in the 
vicinity of NÄlandÄ Ht. returned to the NÄlandÄ Monastery again and studied 
several texts such as the Yoga-sastra, the NyÄyÄnusÄrasastra, the 
Hin-hiang-tui-fa-ming, the HetuvidyÄ-sastra, the PrÄnyamÅ«la-sastra-tÄ«kÄ and the 
Sata-sastra. Although he had studied the Kosa-vibhÄsÄ and the 
SatpadÄbhidharma-sastra in different parts of Kashmir yet he studied them again 
at NÄlandÄ Monastery. He also studied Brahman literary works and a grammatical 
treatise the author of which is not known. On the task of studying the Buddhist 
and Brahman texts he spent five years.</p>
<p>The next country he visited was 
Hiranyaparvata (I-lanna-po-fa-to) where he stayed for one year and read the 
VibhÄsÄ and the NyÄyÄnusÄra-sastra etc. From Hiranyaparvata he made his way to 
the kingdom of Champa where monks followed the Little Vehicle. This country was 
infested with wild beasts such as the elephant, wolf, rhinoceros and black 
leopard. Elephants in that country were used for drawing carriages.</p>
<p>Countries between Champa (Chen-po) and 
Samatata (San-to-ch'a) form another phase of his long journey. He visited 
Hiranya, Kajughira (Ki-shu-ko-kie-lo), Pundravardhana (Pu-na-fa-tan-na) 
Karnasuvarna (Kielo-na-su-fala-na) before arriving at Samatata. Monks in 
Pundravardhana belonged to both vehicles whereas those in Karnasuvarna belong to 
the Little Vehicle of the Sammitiya school. Monks in Karnasurvarna did not use 
either butter or milk in keeping with the traditional teachings of Devadatta. 
Immediately after his account on Samatata he refers to Pegu and Siam which, 
however, lay outside his itinerary.</p>
<p>Countries included in his itinerary in 
the East and South-east of India were TÄmralipti (Tan-mo-li-ti), Orissa, Kalinga 
(Kie-ling-kia), Southern Kosala (Kiao-sa-lo), Andhra (An-to-lo), Dhanakataka 
(To-na-kie-tse-kia) and Chulya. All these countries had centres of Buddhism. He 
refers to an entrepot called Caritra (Chi-li-ta-lo) situated on the 
South-eastern frontier of Orissa.</p>
<p>Dhanakataka, according to Ht. was once a 
reputed centre of learning, and learned men used to come and dwell there but at 
the time of his visit it was entirely desolate.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Chulya may be identified 
with the Cola Kingdom. He locates the Chulya Kingdom outside the Dravida 
country. What made him follow this description is not clear. The Cola Kingdom 
formed part of the Dravida country through the ages.</p>
<p>The next place he visited was the 
Kingdom of Dravida. The territory occupied by Dravida people could have 
consisted of several kingdoms or countries, but Ht. refers to it as forming one 
kingdom. However, the capital of that kingdom is named Kanchipura, the birth 
place of DharmapÄla Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>Whilst in Kanchipura Ht. met some three 
hundred monks from Sinhala. They informed him of the unsettled situation 
prevailing in Sri Lanka at the time. This dissuaded him from going there. His 
purpose of going to Sinhala was to get the Tripitaka explained according to the 
Sthavira school there and also to study the Yoga SÄstra.</p>
<p>MalakÅ«ta was the next important place he 
visited. He refers to Malayagiri which was well-known for sandalwood and the 
karpÅ«ra scented tree. After MalakÅ«ta (Mole-kiu-ch'a) he refers to Sinhala again. 
According to Ht. Sinhala was originally called Po-chu as it had many gems of a 
rare character. As for the origin of the Sinhala he narrates with slight 
variations the legend which traced the origin to a lion king and the murder of 
the lion by his son. According to Ht. it was the son of the lion who arrived in 
Po-chu and not his grandson Vijaya as recorded in Sri Lankan chronicles. A 
second theory about the origin of the Sinhala is narrated as follows: â€œBut it is 
also said that Sinhala is the name of a merchantâ€™s son, who...... came to Po-chu 
island and slew the Rakshasas and established his capital in the country.</p>
<p>With regard to the teachings prevailing 
in Sri Lanka he adds that monks there follow the teachings of the Great Vehicle 
and they belong to the school of the sthaviras. He also refers to the schism 
which resulted in the division of the Sangha into two factions, the 
MahÄviharavÄsins who were opposed to the Great Vehicle and the AbhayagirivÄsins 
who studied both vehicles. His reference to a mountain named LankÄgiri may be 
the SamantakÅ«ta (Adamâ€™s Peak) and it was on that mountain the TathÄgata 
delivered the LankÄvatÄra Sutra according to Ht.</p>
<p>Going two thousand li from Dravida he 
arrived at Konkanpura (Kin-na-po-lo) and from there to Maharashtra, He tells us 
that in a vihÄra at Konkanpura there was a precious head-dress of Prince 
SiddhÄrtha. With reference to Maharashtra he says that the people of that 
country were a warlike nation. He cites in evidence the unsuccessful attempt of 
SilÄditya rÄjÄ to subjugate Pulakesin. This king may be identified as Pulakesin 
II (609-642 A.C) of the Chalukyas of Vatapi in the Bijapur District.</p>
<p>Among the countries included in his 
itinerary to the West and North-west of Narmada were Broach (Baroche), MÄlava 
(Mo-la-po), BrÄhmanapura (K'ie-ch'a), Vallabhi (Fa-la-pi), Ä€nandapura, SurÄshtra 
(Lasn-c'ha) Gurjjara (Kiu-che-lo), Ujjayin (U-che-yen-na), Chi-ki-to, 
Mahesvarapura, SurÄtha, Atyanabakela (O-tin-p'o-chi-lo) and Langala (Lang-kie-lo). 
The last country is situated near the Great Sea towards the country of western 
women. If MÄlavas were the people of Malava or Malwa in Central India as is 
generally taken the countries named about are not placed in right order. 
Ujjayini which is the capital of Malwa is named after Surashtra and Gurjjara 
situated in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Of all the countries in India, Ht. had a 
very high opinion of MÄlava and Magadha. He says that people of these two 
countries had the reputation of loving the study of literature, of honouring 
virtue, of polite language and refined speech. In MÄlava there were twenty 
thousand monks studying the teaching of the Sammitiya school of the small 
vehicle.</p>
<p>We are told that going north-west from 
LangÄla he went to Persia (Po-la-sse) which, lay outside India. It is said that 
the bowl (patrÄ) of the Sakyamuni Buddha was in the royal palace of the country. 
On its frontier is the city of Ormus (Ho-mo). The countries mentioned next are 
Babylon? (Fo-lin), an island called the country of the Western women, which is 
tributary to Fo-lin, Langala, Pitasila (Pi-to-shi-lo), Avanda, Sindh (Sin-tu) 
MÅ«lasthÄnapura or Multan (Mu-lo-s'an-po-la) and Parvati.</p>
<p>If Avanda is to be identified with 
Avanti in Central India which seems probable in view of his desçriptions of that 
country, it is difficult to place Avanda on the route followed from Langala to 
Multan.</p>
<p>The country called Parvata was noted for 
renowned scholars. Ht. stayed there for two years and studied the 
MÅ«lÄbhidharma-sastra, the Saddharma-samparigrahasÄstra and the 
PrasiksÄsatya-sÄstra as preserved in the Sammitiya school.</p>
<p>From Parvata he returned 
south-eastwardly to Magadha and from there to the NÄlandÄ Monastery. There was 
in NÄlandÄ a renowned monk called PrajÃ±abhadra who was versed in the Three 
Pitakas, SÄstras etc. Ht. remained there for two years and had his doubts 
cleared through discussions. He spent two more years studying several branches 
of study under a renowned lay scholar named Jayasena.</p>
<p>He is said to have been apprised of the 
time for his return journey in a dream by Maitreya Bodhisattva. However, he was 
delayed due to unavoidable circumstances. In the meantime, Silabhadra, the 
master of sastras at NÄlandÄ deputed Ht. to expound to the congregation there 
the MahÄyÄna-samparigraha-sastra and to comment on the difficult points of the 
VidyÄ-mÄtra-siddhi-sastra.</p>
<p>About this time Simharasmi and Ht. held 
two different views about the principles of Yoga. Ht. proved more competent in 
the encounter and composed a sastra in three thousand slokas resolving the 
controversy. This work was later approved for study. At this time further 
disputes took place between the adherents of the two vehicles.</p>
<p>Monks in Orissa belittled the Great 
Vehicle and were used to calling it â€œSky Flowersâ€œ. But the king of that country 
had a high regard for the Great Vehicle and challenged the authority of the 
critics. Monks thereupon requested the king to hold a conference at which they 
would settle the issue. The controversy does not appear to have taken place at a 
conference as expected but it came to an end with the compilation of a book 
which was written by Ht. in refutation of the heretical views held by the monks 
of Orissa. The way he refuted heretical views made his fame so widespread that 
king KumÄrarÄja of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India longed to have him as his 
spiritual head in his kingdom. When Ht. showed his reluctance for the third time 
the king turned furious and even went to the extent of threatening that he would 
destroy the whole of NÄlandÄ Monastery in case his request was turned down. 
Although at last Ht, complied with the request of the king, SilÄditya rÄjaâ€™s 
intervention enabled him to get out of another embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>SilÄditya rÄja on his part made 
arrangements to hold a conference for the exposition of the Great Vehicle and to 
refute the views of the followers of the Little Vehicle. Princes of eighteen 
countries were invited to participate in the conference. Renowned Buddhist 
monks, celebrated Brahmans, heretics, non-believers and secular persons attended 
the conference. For five days Ht. extolled the teachings of the Great Vehicle 
and no opponent had any opportunity to assert his views. Adherents of the Little 
Vehicle learning that their school was shattered plotted to kill him. The king, 
however, threatened to behead any one who made an attempt on the life of Ht. It 
is said that, at the end, large multitudes forsook the Little Vehicle and 
embraced the Great-Vehicle. When the conference was over Ht. made up his mind to 
go back to his country. But on a request made to him by SilÄditya to witness the 
quinquennial distribution called 'MahÄ moksa parisad' he had to postpone for ten 
days his return journey.</p>
<p>For his return journey Ht. chose to 
follow the northern route in order to keep the pledge made by him to the king of 
Kan-chang that he would visit him on his way back. Getting out from the city of 
PrayÄga he took the route which lay across Kausambi, Jalandhara, Simhapura, 
TaksasilÄ and the river Indus. The boat laden with ola manuscripts and flower 
seeds capsized in the Indus and fifty manuscript copies and flower seeds were 
lost. From there he went past Lamghan (Lan-po), Varna, Avakan, the snowy 
mountains, Kunduz (Hwoh), Tukhara, Kuran, Bolor and Kashgar up to Khotan.</p>
<p>Of these countries Kashgar and Khotan 
were renowned centres of the Great Vehicle. Whilst in Khotan he states that he 
accomplished a journey of more than 50,000 li. His journey through various 
kingdoms took seventeen years. Here he faced the problem of transporting his 
books, images and such articles and sent a messenger to Kau-chang asking for 
help. Seven or eight months later transport facilities were arranged.</p>
<p>Among the books he brought were 224 
sutras and 192 sÄstras of the Great Vehicle; 15 works of the same categories 
belonging to the Sammitiya School; 22 books of the same belonging to the 
MahisÄsaka school; 67 books.... of the SthaviravÄdin school; 17 works.... of the 
KÄsyapiya school; 42 works..... of the Dharmagupta school; 36 copies of the 
HetuvidyÄ SÄstra; 13 copies of the SabdavidyÄ sastra. Altogether there were 520 
copies comprising 657 volumes carried upon twenty horses.</p>
<p>Then he set upon the gigantic task of 
translating these books into Chinese. For carrying out this project he retired 
to the monastery of Hong-fu in Si-gan-fu. He completed the translation of 74 
distinct works having 1335 chapters. He had moreover made a vast number of 
pictures and wrote with his own hands copies of various sutras. When all these 
works had been finished he closed his eyes and lay perfectly still. â€œHaving 
recited some verses in adoration of Maitreya, he gradually sank until the day of 
his demise on the 10th March, the 13th day of the year 664.â€</p>
<p>HsÅ«an-tsangâ€™s travel accounts which 
appear in the foregoing description furnish information on a wide variety of 
subjects. Some of these such as physical barriers, the relative distribution of 
the centres of the Little and the Great Vehicle in and outside India, Buddhist 
monuments, hospitality shown in different countries, conferences, religious 
encounters have been surveyed in brief in the above account. Apart from these he 
presents a wealth of information on a wide range of subjects such as economic, 
educational and social conditions, religious practices, mannerism, customs 
administration and so on. He enumerates a number of ways of showing respect and 
paying homage that was prevalent among the people of India. Some such forms are</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(i) greeting with a kind of enquiry;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(ii) reverently bowing the head;
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iii) raising the hands to the head 
  with an inclination of the body; </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iv) bowing with hands folded on the 
  chest; </li>
  <li>
  <p>(v) bending a knee; </li>
  <li>
  <p>(vi) kneeling down; </li>
  <li>
  <p>(vii) going down on the ground on 
  hands and knees; </li>
  <li>
  <p>(viii) bowing down with knees, elbows 
  and forehead to the ground and </li>
  <li>
  <p>(ix) prostrating oneself on the 
  ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the general education meant 
for Indians he describes that children in the beginning followed the 'Twelve 
Chapters' and at the age of seven they began to study the great treatises of the 
'Five Sciences'. Some idea of Buddhist education may be gained from his 
description of NÄlandÄ referred to earlier, But his estimation of the Brahmanic 
system of educating beginners is very high. Regarding the Brahmanic teachers he 
says: â€œThese teachers explain the general meaning and teach them minutely, they 
rouse them to activity and skilfully win them over to progress, they instruct 
the inert and sharpen the dull. When disciples intelligent and acute are 
addicted to idle shirking the teachers doggedly persevere repeating instruction 
until their training is finished.....â€</p>
<p>Ht. states that differences among 
various schools of Buddhism were seen in their tenets and also in customs. 
According to Ht. different schools had their own tenets, and controversies ran 
high. As a result each of the eighteen schools claimed that each system was 
intellectually superior to others. Tenets of the Great and the Little systems 
differed widely. Certain concessions and gains were accorded to monks in keeping 
with their knowledge and where the spiritual attainments were high the 
distinctions conferred were extraordinary.</p>
<p>Referring to the three robes allowed for 
monks as their costume he narrates that different schools adhered to different 
styles having broad or narrow fringes and small or large folds. Ht.â€™s 
description about wearing sanghÄti (seng-kio-ki) conforms to the present day 
practice of its wearing by monks in Sri Lanka and other TheravÄda countries. As 
for the antaravÄsa, (ni-po-so-na) the undergarment, he says that it was worn 
without a belt. Rather it was made into plaits and then secured by one of these 
plaits.</p>
<p>Regarding social organisation Ht. 
informs us that society consists of four caste groups. These four castes form 
classes of various degrees of ceremonial purity. The members of a caste marry 
within the caste. Relatives whether by the fatherâ€™s or motherâ€™s side do not 
intermarry and a woman never contracts a second marriage.</p>
<p>Speaking about the character of the 
Indian people he tells us that they were of hasty and irresolute temperament but 
of pure moral principles. They fear retribution for sins in future lives and 
take lightly their plight in the present life. They keep their sworn 
obligations.</p>
<p>His account on law and punishment too, 
is interesting. According to him the offenders who violate statute law were 
imprisoned for life. For offences against social morality, disloyalty and 
unfilial conduct the punishment was mutilation or banishment of the offender out 
of the country or into the wilderness. Other offences can be atoned for by 
paying a fine. He also describes the four ordeals by which the innocence or 
guilt of an accused person is determined.</p>
<p>For offences against the Vinaya, the 
community of brethren has a gradation of penalties. If the offence was slight a 
reprimand was ordered and the punishment became harsh according to the gravity 
of the offence. Expulsion from the community was the worst punishment meted out 
to the most serious offender.</p>
<p>As for the disposal of the dead and the 
performance of the last rites, there were three recognised customs. The first of 
these was cremation. The second was water burial, the corpse being put into a 
stream to float and dissolve. The third was burial in the wilderness, the body 
being cast away in the woods to be eaten up by wild animals.</p>
<p>The Buddhist brethren were forbidden to 
wail aloud over a departed one. On the death of a parent they read a service of 
gratitude to secure for the deceased person bliss in the next life.</p>
<p>If we are to depend on the records left 
by Ht. certain kings of the Gupta dynasty have patronised Buddhism. According to 
him Purugupta Vikrama PrakÄsÄditya, a brother of Skandagupta, Narasimhagupta 
BalÄditya, son and successor of Purugupta, TathÄgatarÄja Vainyagupta, another 
son of Purugupta and Vajira, a son of Narasimhagupta BalÄditya patronised 
Buddhism. All these kings contributed to the promotion of Buddhist learning by 
building monastic establishments at NÄlandÄ.</p>
<p>According to Ht. the worship of relics 
was widely practised in many Buddhist countries traversed by him and among these 
the most popular was the cult of the Tooth Relic of the Buddha. It was prevalent 
in Bhaktra; in an unnamed temple of a small valley situated to the east of the 
snowy mountain; Kashmir and Simbala. The next popular Buddhist cult was that of 
the Bowl-relic.</p>
<p>Purusapura, the capital of GandhÄra as 
well as Persia are mentioned as countries where the Bowl-relic was venerated. 
The following objects too were venerated: the sweeping brush made of kusa grass 
in Bhaktra, the skull-bone at Hidda (Kilo of Fa-hsien) in Nagarahara (Jelalabad), 
the eye ball, the sanghÄti robe, and the staff at the same site and the garment 
washing stone obtained in UdyÄna. A strong tradition about the Buddha presenting 
pieces of his nails and some hair to two merchants who offered him honey and 
rice cake is recorded by Ht. with regard to Bhaktra (The Life p.50). This is 
evidently based on the account in the Vinays MahÄvagga where two merchants play 
a similar role at Bodh Gaya though no reference is made there to the 
presentation of nails to them.</p>
<p>On his way to India he passed through 
countries where Buddhism did not have adherents. Two such countries were Kan-chang 
and Sa-mo-kien. He succeeded in propagating Buddhism in those countries by 
delivering effective sermons. In the latter some devotees were so taken up with 
the teachings that they even entered the Buddhist Order. It was partly due to 
his evangelist endeavours that Buddhism which lay dormant after the age of the 
Guptas began to flourish during the reign of Harshavardhana. </p>
