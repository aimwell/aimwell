<p><b>1. Mānābharana, Mānabhūsana.</b> Nephew of Vijayabāhu 
I. His father was king of Pandu and his mother, Mittā, was Vijayabāhu’s sister. 
He had two brothers, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha. He married Ratanāvalī, 
daughter of Vijayabāhu (Cv.lix.42ff). When Vijayabāhu died, Jayabāhu I. became 
king and Mānābharana was made viceroy. When the rightful heir, Vikkamabāhu, rose 
in revolt, Mānābharana seized from him Rohana and Dakkhinadesa and lived in 
Punkhagāma, under the name of Vīrabāhu (Cv.lxi.21ff). He seems to have lived in 
constant conflict with Vikkamabāhu. Later, when he had already two daughters, 
Mittā and Pabhāvatī, he gave over the government to his ministers and retired 
from the world. But seven or eight months later he had a dream in the temple of 
Indra and hurried back to Punkhagāma because the dream presaged the birth of a 
mighty son. This son was Parakkamabāhu I. Cv.lxii.3ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mānābharana. </b>Son of Sirivallabha and Sugalā. 
Līlāvatī was his sister (Cv.lxii.2). He married Mittā, daughter of Mānābharana 
I., and also her sister, Pabhāvatī, and by the latter he had a son, 
Kittisirimegha (Cv.lxiv. 19, 23, 24). Mānābharana reigned in Rohana as an 
independent king (Cv.lxvii.95). When the throne was captured by Gajabāhu, 
Mānābharana tried several times to wrest it from him, but, failing in these 
attempts, made an alliance with Gajabāhu through the intervention of the monks; 
later, however, finding Parakkamabāhu growing in power, he went over to him 
(Cv.lxx.179ff). When Gajabāhu was captured and detained at Pulatthinagara, the 
soldiers started to pillage the city, despite the orders of Parakkamabāhu. The 
people were enraged and invited Mānābharana to come. On his arrival at 
Pulatthipura, he captured Gajabāhu and threw him into a dungeon, seized all the 
treasures, including the Tooth Relic and Alms bowl, and took counsel with his 
mother to kill Gajabāhu. On hearing of this, Parakkamabāhu sent his forces 
against Mānābharana and defeated the latter’s followers at various places. 
Mānābharana then fled to Rohana, taking with him some of the treasures 
(Cv.lxx.255ff). From there he again tried to ally himself with Gajabāhu; but the 
latter did not so desire, though his ministers were in favor of it. Relying on 
their support, Mānābharana advanced from Rohana. He was, however, severely 
defeated at Pūnagāma and other places and Parakkamabāhu’s forces assailed him 
from all sides. The campaign brought varying success to the opposing armies, and 
Mānābharana proved a skilful warrior. He was helped by various chieftains and 
fought bitterly and valiantly to the end (for details see Cv.lxxii.148 309), 
but, as he lay dying, he summoned his children and ministers and counseled them 
to join Parakkamabāhu. Even after his death his queen Sugalā encouraged 
intrigues against Parakkamabāhu . Cv.lxxiv.29ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mānābharana.</b> A general of Māgha, for whose 
coronation he was responsible. Cv.lxxx.73.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Mānābharana.</b> A Damila chief, ally of Kulasekhara. 
Cv.lxxvi.146.</p>
