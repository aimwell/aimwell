<p>The Bodhisatta was once a quail. There was a fowler who 
enticed quails by imitating their cry and then throwing a net over them. The 
Bodhisatta suggested that when the fowler did this, they should all fly away 
with the net. This they did, and, day after day, the fowler returned empty 
handed till his wife grew angry. One day, two of the quails started quarrelling, 
and the Bodhisatta, hearing their wrangling, decided to go elsewhere with his 
following. When the fowler came again and spread his net, the two quails started 
quarrelling, and he was able to capture them.</p>
<p>This was one of the, stories related at the time of the 
quarrel (Cumbatakalaha) between the Sākyans and the Koliyans (J.i.208 10). See 
also the introductory story of the Kunāla Jātaka. Elsewhere the story is called 
the Vattaka Jātaka. E.g., J.v.414.</p>
