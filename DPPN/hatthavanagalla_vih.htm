<p>A monastery, erected by Gothābhaya on the spot where 
Sirisanghabodhi (q.v.) gave his head as a gift to a poor man. It was repaired by 
Parakkamabāhu II. Vijayabāhu III. was cremated near the vihāra, and 
Parakkamabāhu II. built there a cetiya and an octagonal image house which 
contained a stone image of the Buddha (Cv.lxxxv.73f). It is said that a king, 
named Upatissa, had built in the monastery a five storeyed pāsāda in honour of a 
monk who made the earth and sky resound with thunder at the moment of his 
attainment of arahantship. Parakkamabāhu II. found it fallen into decay and had 
it restored in his name. His minister, Devappatirāja, erected, in the king’s 
name, a three storeyed pāsāda, gave it to Anomadassī Thera, who was chief 
incumbent of the vihāra at that time, and set up a stone inscription to record 
the gift. Cv.lxxxvi.12f, 37f.</p>
