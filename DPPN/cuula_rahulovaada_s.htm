  <h2>Cūla-Rahulovāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha realises that Rāhula is 
possessed of the qualities necessary to Deliverance and goes with him to 
Andhavana for the siesta. There the Buddha demonstrates, by means of question 
and answer, that all things are impermanent, and impresses on Rāhula the manner 
in which the disciples of the Ariyans should strive to be delivered from them. 
Rāhula takes the lesson to heart, and even as it is being delivered attains to 
arahantship. (M.iii.277f; this sutta is also found at S.iv.105ff, where it is 
called the Rāhula Sutta). </p>
<p>Many thousands of devas are present at 
the preaching of the sermon, and this sutta is therefore given as an 
illustration of the Buddha’s great compassion (E.g., UdA.324; MA.i320; also 
Mil.20). Among the suttas specially preached to Rāhula, this one emphasises 
vipassanā (AA.ii.547). It may have been the incidents mentioned in this sutta 
that were illustrated in the relic-chamber of the Mahā Thūpa. See Mhv.xxx.83.</p>
