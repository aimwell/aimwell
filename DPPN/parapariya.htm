<p>An arahant. He was the son of a very eminent brahmin of 
Sāvatthi, and was so called because the name of his family was Pārāpara. One day 
he went to Jetavana to hear the Buddha preach, and the Buddha, seeing him, 
preached the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta. </p>
<p>This probably refers to M.iii.298ff., which deals with the 
views of the brahmin teacher Pārāsariya, and then gives the method of developing 
the indriyas as taught in the Ariyan Vinaya. The sutta, however, was preached at 
Kajañgalā and not at Sāvatthi, the questioners being Uttara, a pupil of 
Pārāsariya, and Ānanda. See Brethren 295, n.1.</p>
<p>After learning the sutta, Pārāpariya pondered on its 
meaning and won arahantship (Thag.vs.726ff.; ThagA.ii.17f). The Theragāthā 
contains a number of verses (Vs.920 49; ThagA.ii.74ff) spoken by Pārāpariya 
after the Buddha’s parinibbāna and immediately before his own death.</p>
