<p>The god to whom Sakka entrusted the 
guardianship of Lank훮 and its people. He met Vijaya and his followers when they 
landed in Ceylon and sprinkled water on them and wound a sacred thread about 
their hands for protection (Mhv.vii.5). The god is generally identified with 
Visnu, though there is evidence to show that, at least in later mythology, the 
two gods were distinct. Somewhere about A.D. 790, a shrine was erected to 
Uppalavanna in Devanagara (modern Dondra) in South Ceylon. This shrine was later 
plundered by the Portuguese. King V카rab훮hu offered there a sacrifice of victory 
(Cv.lxxxiii.49; see also Cv.Trs.ii.152, n.3) and Parakkamab훮hu II. rebuilt the 
shrine.</p>
