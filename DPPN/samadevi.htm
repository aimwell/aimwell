<p>A favourite of King Bhātika of Ceylon. On one occasion a 
large number of men were charged before the king with having eaten beef. He 
inflicted a fine, but, as they were unable to pay, he appointed them as 
scavengers to the palace. One of them had a beautiful daughter, Sāmadevī, whom 
the king liked and installed in his harem. Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived 
happily. VibhA.440.</p>
