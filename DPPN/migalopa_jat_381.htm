  <h2>Migālopa Jātaka (No. 381)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as a vulture, Aparannagijjha, 
and lived with his son, Migālopa, in Gijjhapabbata. Migālopa used to fly much 
higher than the others in spite of his father’s warning, and he was, one day, 
dashed to pieces by the Verambha winds.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an unruly monk who is 
identified with Migālopa. J.iii.255f.; cp. Gijjha Jātaka (No. 427).</p>
