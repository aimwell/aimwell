  <h2>Simsapā Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha, while staying in Simsapāvana in Kosambī, takes 
up a handful of leaves and tells the monks that the things he has discovered and 
not revealed, compared to those he has revealed, are as the handful of leaves to 
the leaves in the forest. What he has not revealed does not conduce to 
tranquillity, Nibbāna. He has revealed Ill, its cause, cessation, and the way 
thereto; this does conduce to Nibbāna. S.v.437.</p>
