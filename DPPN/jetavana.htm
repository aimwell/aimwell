<p><b>1. Jetavana.</b>-A park in SÄvatthi, in 
which was built the AnÄthapindikÄrÄma. When the Buddha accepted AnÄthapindikaâ€™s 
invitation to visit SÄvatthi the latter, seeking a suitable place for the 
Buddhaâ€™s residence, discovered this park belonging to JetakumÄra (MA.i.471 says 
it was in the south of SÄvatthi). When he asked to be allowed to buy it, Jetaâ€™s 
reply was: â€œNot even if you could cover the whole place with money.â€ 
AnÄthapindika said that he would buy it at that price, and when Jeta answered 
that he had had no intention of making a bargain, the matter was taken before 
the Lords of Justice, who decided that if the price mentioned were paid, 
AnÄthapindika had the right of purchase. AnÄthapindika had gold brought down in 
carts and covered Jetavana with pieces laid side by side. (This incident is 
illustrated in a bas-relief at the Bharhut Tope; see Cunningham â€” the StÅ«pa of 
Bharhut, Pl.lvii., pp.84-6). The money brought in the first journey was found 
insufficient to cover one small spot near the gateway. So AnÄthapindika sent his 
servants back for more, but Jeta, inspired by AnÄthapindikaâ€™s earnestness, asked 
to be allowed to give this spot. AnÄthapindika agreed and Jeta erected there a 
gateway, with a room over it. AnÄthapindika built in the grounds dwelling rooms, 
retiring rooms, store rooms and service halls, halls with fireplaces, closets, 
cloisters, halls for exercise, wells, bathrooms, ponds, open and roofed sheds, 
etc. (Vin.ii.158f).</p>
<p>It is said (MA.i.50; UdA.56f) that 
AnÄthapindika paid eighteen crores for the purchase of the site, all of which 
Jeta spent in the construction of the gateway gifted by him. (The gateway was 
evidently an imposing structure; see J.ii.216).</p>
<p>Jeta gave, besides, many valuable trees 
for timber. AnÄthapindika himself spent fifty-four crores in connection with the 
purchase of the park and the buildings erected in it.</p>
<p>The ceremony of dedication was one of 
great splendour. Not only AnÄthapindika himself, but his whole family took part: 
his son with five hundred other youths, his wife with five hundred other noble 
women, and his daughters MahÄ SubhaddÄ and CÅ«la SubhaddÄ with five hundred other 
maidens. AnÄthapindika was attended by five hundred bankers. The festivities in 
connection with the dedication lasted for nine months (J.i.92ff).</p>
<p>Some of the chief buildings attached to 
the Jetavana are mentioned in the books by special names, viz., MahÄgandhakuti, 
KaverimandalamÄla, Kosambakuti and CandanamÄla. SNA.ii.403. Other buildings are 
also mentioned â€” e.g., the Ambalakotthaka-ÄsanasÄlÄ (J.ii.246). According to 
Tibetan sources the vihÄra was built according to a plan sent by the devas of 
Tusita and contained sixty large halls and sixty small. The Dulva also gives 
details of the decorative scheme of the vihÄra (Rockhill: op. cit.48 and n.2).</p>
<p>All these were built by AnÄthapindika; 
there was another large building erected by Pasenadi and called the Salalaghara 
(DA.ii.407). Over the gateway lived a guardian deity to prevent all evildoers 
from entering (SA.i.239). Just outside the monastery was a rÄjayatana-tree, the 
residence of the god Samiddhisumana (Mhv.i.52f; MT 105; but see DhA.i.41, where 
the guardian of the gateway is called Sumana).</p>
<p>In the grounds there seems to have been 
a large pond which came to be called the JetavanapokkharanÄ«. (AA.i.264; here the 
Buddha often bathed (J.i.329ff.). Is this the Pubbakotthaka referred to at 
A.iii.345? But see S.v.220; it was near this pond that Devadatta was swallowed 
up in AvÄ«ci (J.iv.158)). </p>
<p>The grounds themselves were thickly 
covered with trees, giving the appearance of a wooded grove (araÃ±Ã±a) 
(Sp.iii.532). On the outskirts of the monastery was a mango-grove (J.iii.137). 
In front of the gateway was the Bodhi-tree planted by AnÄthapindika, which came 
later to be called the Ä€nandabodhi (q.v.) (J.iv.228f). Not far from the 
gateway was a cave which became famous as the KapallapÅ«vapabbhÄra 
on account of an incident connected with Macchariya-Kosiya (J.i.348).</p>
<p>Near Jetavana was evidently a monastery 
of the heretics where CiÃ±cÄmÄnavikÄ spent her nights while hatching her 
conspiracy against the Buddha. (DhA.iii.179; behind Jetavana was a spot where 
the Ajivakas practised their austerities (J.i.493). Once the heretics bribed 
Pasenadi to let them make a rival settlement behind Jetavana, but the Buddha 
frustrated their plans (J.ii.170)). </p>
<p>There seems to have been a playground 
just outside Jetavana used by the children of the neighbourhood, who, when 
thirsty, would go into Jetavana to drink (DhA.iii.492). The high road to 
SÄvatthi passed by the edge of Jetavana, and travellers would enter the park to 
rest and refresh themselves (J.ii.203, 341; see also vi.70, where two roads are 
mentioned). </p>
<p>According to the DivyÄvadÄna (Dvy.395f), 
the thÅ«pas of SÄriputta and MoggallÄna were in the grounds of Jetavana and 
existed until the time of Asoka. Both Fa Hien (Giles: p.33ff) 
and Houien Thsang (Beal.ii.7ff) give descriptions of 
other incidents connected with the Buddha, which took place in the neighbourhood 
of Jetavana â€” e.g., the murder of SundarikÄ, the calumny of CiÃ±cÄ, Devadattaâ€™s 
attempt to poison the Buddha, etc.</p>
<p>The space covered by the four bedposts 
of the Buddhaâ€™s Gandhakuti in Jetavana is one of the four avijahitatthÄnÄni; all 
Buddhas possess the same, though the size of the actual vihÄra differs in the 
case of the various Buddhas. For VipassÄ« Buddha, the setthi Punabbasumitta built 
a monastery extending for a whole league, while for SikhÄ«, the setthi Sirivaddha 
made one covering three gavutas. The SanghÄrÄma built by Sotthiya for VessabhÅ« 
was half a league in extent, while that erected by Accuta for Kakusandha covered 
only one gÄvuta. Konagamanaâ€™s monastery, built by the setthi Ugga, extended for 
half a gÄvuta, while Kassapaâ€™s built by Sumangala covered sixteen karÄ«sas. 
AnÄthapindikaâ€™s monastery covered a space of eighteen karÄ«sas (BuA.2, 47; 
J.i.94; DA.ii.424).</p>
<p>The Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons 
in Jetavana (DhA.i.3; BuA.3; AA.i.314). It is said 
that after the MigÄramÄtupÄsÄda came into being, the Buddha would dwell 
alternately in Jetavana and MigÄramÄtupÄsÄda, often spending the day in one and 
the night in the other (SNA.i.336).</p>
<p>According to a description given by Fa 
Hien (Giles, pp.31, 33), the vihÄra was originally in seven sections (storeys?) 
and was filled with all kinds of offerings, embroidered banners, canopies, etc., 
and the lamps burnt from dusk to dawn.</p>
<p>One day a rat, holding in its mouth a 
lamp wick, set fire to the banners and canopies, and all the seven sections were 
entirely destroyed. The vihÄra was later rebuilt in two sections. There were two 
main entrances, one on the east, one on the west, and Fa Hsien found thÅ«pas 
erected at all the places connected with the Buddha, each with its name 
inscribed.</p>
<p>The vihÄra is almost always referred to 
as Jetavane AnÄthapindikassa Ä€rÄma. The Commentaries (MA.ii.50; UdA.56f, etc.) 
say that this was deliberate (at the Buddhaâ€™s own suggestion pp.81-131; Beal: 
op. cit., ii.5 and Rockhill: p.49), in order that the names of both earlier and 
later owners might be recorded and that people might be reminded of two men, 
both very generous in the cause of the Religion, so that others might follow 
their example. The vihÄra is sometimes referred to as JetÄrÄma (E.g., Ap.i.400).</p>
<p>In the district of Saheth-Mabeth, with 
which the region of SÄvatthi is identified, Saheth is considered to be Jetavana 
(Arch. Survey of India, 1907-8, pp.81-131).</p>

<p><b>2. Jetavana.</b>-A monastery in 
AnurÄdhapura, situated in the Jotivana (q.v.) and founded by MahÄsena at the 
instigation of a monk named Tissa of the DakkhinÄrÄma. The monks of the 
MahÄvihÄra protested against this and Jetavana was later given to them 
(Mhv.xxxvii.32ff). Attached to the vihÄra is a large thÅ«pa. The work was 
completed by Sirimeghavanna (Cv.xxxvii.65). DÄthàpabhuti held in the vihÄra the 
ceremony in honour of the DhammadhÄtu (Cv.xli.40; also Cv.Trs.i.55, n.2), while 
MahÄnÄga gave to it the village of Vasabha in UddhagÄma and three hundred 
fields, to ensure a permanent supply of rice gruel to the monks (Cv.xli.97f). 
Aggabodhi II. crowned the thÅ«pa with a lightning conductor (cumbata) 
(Cv.xlii.66), Jetthatissa I. gave for its maintenance the village of GondigÄma 
(Cv.xliv.97), and Aggabodhi III. bestowed on it the MahÄmanikagÄma 
(Cv.xliv.121). PotthasÄta, senÄpati of Aggabodhi IV., built in the vihÄra the 
Aggabodhi-parivena (Cv.xlvi.22), and Aggabodhi IX. made a golden image to be 
placed in the shrine-room (Cv.xlix.77).</p>
<p>Sena I. erected in the monastery grounds 
a mansion of several storeys (Cv., l.65). Kassapa V. gave a village for the 
maintenance of the refectory (Cv.lii.59), while four officials of Mahinda IV. 
built four parivenas attached to the vihÄra (Cv.liv.49).</p>
<p>The monks of Jetavana, though nominally 
forming part of the MahÄvihÄra fraternity, held divergent views in regard to the 
teachings of the Buddha, and were considered as a separate sect (the SÄgaliyas) 
till ParakkamabÄhu 1. united all the fraternities (Cv.lxxviii.22).</p>
<p>The thÅ«pa at Jetavana was restored by 
ParakkamabÄhu I. to a height of two hundred and ten feet (Cv.lxxviii.98).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Jetavana.</b>-A monastery in Pulatthipura, 
built by ParakkamabÄhu I. It included the building which housed the Tivanka 
image (Cv.lxxviii.32, 47). The NammadÄ Canal flowed through the grounds of 
Jetavana. Ibid., lxxix.48. See also Cv.Trs.ii.105, n.5.</p>
