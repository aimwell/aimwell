<p>A monk of Vesālī. In settling a dispute 
regarding the estate of his lay-supporter, he was accused of partisanship by one 
of the parties concerned and was reported to Ānanda. The case went up before 
Upāli, who decided in favour of Ajjuka (Vin.iii.66-7), and was commended by the 
Buddha for this decision. ThagA.i.370; AA.i.172.</p>
