<h2>Badarikārāma</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A park about three miles 
from Kosambī (S.iii.126)  where Khemaka stayed during his illness. He was visited 
by monks from the Ghositārāma (SA.ii.230). The Buddha is said to have stayed 
there and to have preached the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.160) and the Tittira 
Jātaka (J.iii.64) regarding Rāhula (q.v.), who spent a whole night in the 
Buddha’s jakes at the Badarikārāma because he was unwilling to violate the rule 
laid down by the Buddha that no novice should share the room of an ordained monk 
(see also Vin.iv.16).</p>
