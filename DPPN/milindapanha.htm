<p>Records the conversation between <a href="milinda.htm" title="me_mu/milinda.htm">Milinda</a> 
and <a href="nagasena.htm" title="n/nagasena.htm">Nāgasena</a>. </p>
<p>It is believed that the book was compiled later than the 
time of the conversation and that many of the recorded conversations are 
spurious. </p>
<p>For a discussion see Question of King Milinda, vol.i.xxv

<p>There is a Singhalese translation to it, which is called 
the Saddharmādāsaya, written in the eighteenth century by a monk named 
Sumangala. P.L.C.274.</p>
