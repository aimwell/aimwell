<p>The Bodhisatta was once a tree-sprite in a sāla grove. A new king 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> 
was appointed by <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, and the king gave orders to the tree sprites to choose 
their abodes. The Bodhisatta advised his kinsmen to choose trees near his own. 
Some did not follow his advice and dwelt in the lonely trees. A tempest came and 
uprooted the lonely trees, leaving the trees in the grove unscathed.</p>
<p>This story was one of those related by the Buddha to the Sākiyans and 
Koliyans, who fought for the waters of the <a href="rohini.htm" title="r/rohini.htm">Rohinī</a>. He wished to show them the 
value of concord (J.i.327ff).</p>
<p>For another Jātaka, not found in the Jātaka Commentary, but quoted in the 
Anguttara Nikāya and sometimes (E.g., ThagA.i.397) referred to as the 
Rukkhadhamma Jātaka, see <a href="suppatitthita.htm" title="s/suppatitthita.htm">Suppatittha</a>.</p>
