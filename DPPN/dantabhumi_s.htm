<p><a href="jayasena.htm" title="j/jayasena.htm">Jayasena</a> visits the novice 
<a href="aciravata.htm" title="am/aciravata.htm">Aciravata</a> at 
the Forest Hut in Veluvana and asks him to explain how a monk whose life is 
strenuous and purged of self can find peace in his heart.  </p>
<p>At the end of Aciravataâ€™s discourse, Jayasena leaves him, complaining that the matter is not 
at all clear to him.  </p>
<p>Aciravata mentions the matter to the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, who says that Jayasena cannot understand 
such matters, being too fond of pleasure and undisciplined. </p>
<p>He illustrates his meaning by various 
examples, one being a description of the catching and taming of a wild elephant.
