<p>A monk who lived soon after the death of 
<a href="kassapa.htm" title="ka/kassapa.htm">Kassapa</a> Buddha. </p>
<p>Having been guilty of various offences, 
he was charged by his colleague <a href="dhammavaadi.htm" title="d/dhammavaadi.htm">Dhammavādi</a>; he persuaded certain vinayadhara 
monks to give an ex parte judgment in his favour (SnA.i.195-7). </p>
<p>The two monks 
who were chiefly responsible for this judgment were later known as 
<a href="hemavata.htm" title="h/hemavata.htm">Hemavata</a> and 
<a href="satagira.htm" title="sa/satagira.htm">Sātāgira</a>.</p>
