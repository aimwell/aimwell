<p><b>1. Mittā </b>(v.l. Mettā) <b>Therī</b>. Ninety one 
kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, she was one of the consorts of King 
Bandhumā and won meritorious kamma by bestowing food and costly raiment on an 
arahant Therī. After death she was born in Tavātimsa and was wife of the king of 
the gods thirty times, and then chief queen of twenty kings of men. In this age 
she belonged to a Sākyan family of Kapilavatthu and left the world with Pajāpatī 
Gotamī, winning arahantship soon after. (Thig.vs.31f )</p>
<p>She is evidently identical with Ekapinidadāyikā of the 
Apadāna. ThigA.36f.; Ap.ii.515f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mittā.</b> Younger sister of Vijayabāhu I. She 
married the Pandu king and had three sons, Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha and 
Sirivallabha. Cv.lix.41; lxi.1; lxii.1.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mittā.</b> Daughter of Mānābharana (1), her sister 
being Pabhāvatī. She married Mānābharana, son of Sirivallabha. Cv.lxii.3; 
lxiii.6; lxiv.19.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Mittā Sutta. </b>Those whom one holds in affection 
one should admonish and establish in the satipatthānas. S.v.189.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mittā Sutta.</b> The same as 1, with the four Ayrian 
Truths. S.v.434.</p>
