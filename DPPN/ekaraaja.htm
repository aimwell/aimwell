<p><b>1. Ekarāja.</b>-King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He was the 
<a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>. A minister, whom he expelled on the ground of misconduct in the 
royal harem, took service under <a href="dabbasena.htm" title="d/dabbasena.htm">Dabbasena</a>, king of 
<a href="kosala.htm" title="ku/kosala.htm">Kosala</a>, and incited him to 
make war on Ekarāja. The latter was captured while sitting on the dais in the 
midst of his councillors and hanged head downwards by a cord from the lintel of 
a door. In this position Ekarāja cultivated thoughts of loving-kindness towards 
his enemy and attained a stage of complete absorption in mystic meditation. His 
bonds burst and he sat cross-legged in mid air. Dabbasena was, meanwhile, seized 
with a burning pain in his body and, on the advice of his courtiers, had Ekarāja 
released, whereupon the pains disappeared. Realising Ekarāja’s holiness, 
Dabbasena restored the kingdom to him and asked his forgiveness (J.iii.13-15).</p>
<p>In the 
<a href="ekaraaja_jat_303.htm" title="am/ekaraaja_jat_303.htm">Ekarāja Jātaka</a>, reference is made 
to the <a href="mahasilava_jat_051.htm" title="maha/mahasilava_jat_051.htm">Mahāsīlava Jātaka</a> for details regarding the expulsion of the 
minister for misconduct and of the subsequent events. But there the king is 
called Sīlava and not Ekarāja. The two stories contain certain similarities but 
the details vary very much. See also the <a href="seyya_jat_282.htm" title="s/seyya_jat_282.htm">Seyya Jātaka</a>, where the king is called</p>
<p>Kamsa, and compare it with the 
<a href="ghata_jat_355_454.htm" title="g/ghata_jat_355_454.htm">Ghata 
Jātaka</a>. The Ekarāja Jātaka is given as an example of a birth in which the 
Bodhisatta practised mettā to perfection (E.g., BuA.51; Mbv.11). The story of 
Ekarāja is the last in the Cariyā-Pitaka (No. xiv).  </p>
<p>According to the Cariyā 
Pitaka Commentary (p.205), Ekarāja was a title given to the king on account of 
his great power, in which case his real name might have been Sīlava, as 
mentioned above. The scholiast on the Ekarāja Jātaka (J.iii.14), however, says 
that Ekarāja was the king’s personal name.</p>

<p><b>2. Ekarāja.</b>-King of Pupphavatī 
(<a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>). He was the son of <a href="vasavattii.htm" title="va/vasavattii.htm">Vasavatti</a> and the father of 
<a href="candakumaara.htm" title="c/candakumaara.htm">Candakumāra</a>. For his 
story see the <a href="khandahaala_jat_542.htm" title="ku/khandahaala_jat_542.htm">Khandahāla Jātaka</a> (J.vi.131ff). He belonged to the
<a href="kondanna.htm" title="ku/kondanna.htm">Kondaññagotta</a> 
(J.vi.137).</p>
