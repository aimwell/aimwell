<p>1. Kāyasakkhi Sutta.-Savittha and Mahā-Kotthita 
once visit Sāriputta. Sāriputta asks them: Which is the most excellent — one who 
has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by 
faith? Savittha prefers the one released by faith, Mahā-Kotthita the one who has 
testified to the truth with body, while Sāriputta’s preference is for the one 
who has won view, for in him insight is most developed.</p>
<p>Together they go to the Buddha and put 
the case before him; the Buddha tells them that it is not an easy matter to 
decide. A.i.118f</p>
<p>2. Kāyasakkhi Sutta.-A description of 
the kāyasakkkī — one who has attained and experienced the four jhānas. A.iv.451f</p>
