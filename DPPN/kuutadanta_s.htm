<p>Preached at Khānumata. Kūtadanta 
consults the Buddha on the best way of making a sacrifice efficacious, and the 
Buddha tells him of a sacrifice held in days of yore by King Mahā Vijitāvī, 
under the guidance of his enlightened purohita. The sacrifice is undertaken with 
the co-operation of the four divisions of the king’s subjects. The king has 
eight personal qualifications, as has his chaplain. No living thing is injured; 
all the labour is voluntary and the sacrifice is offered, not only on behalf of 
the king, but of all the good. No regrets are felt at any stage of the 
sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Buddha then proceeds to tell 
Kūtadanta of other forms of “sacrifice” more potent than the gift of material 
things, and ends the sutta with a description of arahantship.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the discourse 
Kūtadanta declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha. D.i.127ff.</p>
