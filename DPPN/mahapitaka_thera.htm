</ul>
<p>Of Ceylon. He was an eminent Thera and was teacher of 
Catunikāyika Tissa Thera. </p>
<p>At the time of the great disturbance in the country (mahābhaya, 
probably the Brāhmanatissamahābhaya) there was only one monk who knew the 
Mahāniddesa, and Mahāpitaka asked his colleague, Mahārakkhita, to learn it from 
him. But the latter refused on the plea of the wickedness of the monk possessing 
this knowledge; but in the end he acquiesced, on condition that Mahāpitaka 
himself would be present at the lessons. On the day of the last lesson he 
discovered a woman hidden under the teacher’s bed. Sp.iii.695.</p>
