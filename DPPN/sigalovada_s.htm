<p>Sigāla (Singāla), a young householder of Rājagaha, was in 
the habit of rising early, bathing, and, with wet hair and garments, worshipping 
the several quarters of the earth and sky. The Buddha saw him once and asked him 
the reason for this. Sigāla’s reply was that his dead father had asked him to do 
so. The Buddha then taught him that, in his religion, too, there war, worship of 
the six quarters, but that these quarters were different. Urged by Sigāla, to 
explain, the Buddha taught him the six vices in conduct, the four motives for 
such evil action, the six channels for dissipating wealth, and the different 
kinds of friends. He then taught him the six quarters to be honoured by 
performing the duties owing to them parents are the east, teachers the south, 
wife and children the west, friends and companions the north, servants and 
workpeople the nadir, religious teachers and brahmins the zenith. Details are 
then given of the duties owing to these and of their counter duties.</p>
<p>The sutta is an exposition of the whole domestic and 
social duty of a layman, according to the Buddhist point of view, and, as such, 
it is famous under the name of Gihivinaya (D.iii.180-93).</p>
<p>Sigālaka became the Buddha’s follower. According to the 
Apadāna (Ap.ii.604), it was this Sigālaka’s mother who was known as Sigālakamātā 
(q.v.).</p>
