<p>An Arahant. In the time of Piyadassī Buddha he was a 
hunter and, having seen the Buddha, built for him a gabled hut covered with 
lotuses, which the Buddha occupied for seven days. Then, at the Buddha’s wish, 
his attendant monk Sudassana came with thousands of monks, and the Buddha 
declared the future in store for the hunter. Ap.i.326f.</p>
