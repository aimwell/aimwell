  <h2>Lambakannā</h2>

<p>A gotta, mentioned in the Chronicles as being among the 
inhabitants of Ceylon. The Lambakannas had, probably, certain duties to perform 
in connection with the consecration of a king. This was perhaps the reason why 
Parakkamabāhu I. gave them a prominent place in the ceremonies held in honour of 
the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.213); see also below, in the text. </p>
<p>We find that Ilanāga, when be went to take his ceremonial 
bath in Tissavāpi, was enraged on finding that the Lambakannā were not there. As 
a punishment, he ordered them to work at the remaking of a road along the bank 
of the tank, leading to the Mahā Thūpa, and set candalas to supervise them. Full 
of anger, the Lambakannas rose in revolt and seized the throne. Three years 
later the king returned from exile, and, having defeated the Lambakannas, made 
them drag his chariot in triumphal procession. When he proposed to behead them 
his mother intervened, and he contented himself with having their noses and toes 
cut off (Mhv.xxxv.18ff).</p>
<p>The Lambakannas were evidently a powerful clan, and 
several members of the clan ruled as kings of Ceylon — 
e.g., Vasabha, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya, the last three of whom 
came from Mahiyangana and seized the throne from Vijayakumāra (Mhv.xxxvi.58ff). 
Between the reign of Kittisirimegha and the Coliyan conquest in 1017 A.C.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
i.e., between the third and the eleventh centuries&nbsp;&nbsp; out of thirty six 
kings who occupied the throne of Ceylon the majority belonged to either the 
Moriyā or the Lambakannā. A clan of Lambakannas lived also in South India in the 
twelfth century. When Lankāpura, acting under the orders of Parakkamabāhu I., 
crowned Vīrapandu as king of Pandu, three Lambakanna chiefs were asked to carry 
out “the duties of the Lambakannas” (Lambakannadhuram) (Cv.lxxvii.27f).</p>
<p>The name may have had a totemistic origin, but according 
to some Singhalese Chronicles (E.g., the Saddharmaratnākara and the 
Pārakumbā-Sirita) the Lambakannas of Ceylon were a branch of the Moriyas. They 
claimed descent from Sumitta — a prince of the 
Moriyan clan, who formed one of the escort that brought the Bodhi-tree from 
India — and Sumanā, a princess of the same race, 
who was at one time a nun, ordained under Sanghamīttā. According to these 
Chronicles most of the kings of Ceylon down to the time of Parakkamabāhu VI. 
were scions of this clan.</p>
<p>In Ceylon, the Lambakannas had settlements in Rohana. See, 
e.g., AA.i.262.</p>
