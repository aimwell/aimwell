<p>A village of the Sākyans. Once, when the Buddha was there 
with a large number of monks, Mira tempted them in the guise of a 
jatanduva-brahmin (S.i.117). </p>
<p>The village was the birthplace of Bandhura Thera 
(ThagA.i.208). A story is also told of the temptation by Māra of Samiddhi when 
he was with the Buddha. S.i.118, but in ThagA.i.117, the incident is located in 
Tapodārāma.</p>
