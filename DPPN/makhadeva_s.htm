  <h2>Makhādeva Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha visits the Makhādeva ambavana, and, at a 
certain spot, smiles. In reply to Ānanda’s question, he tells him the story of 
<a href="makhadeva.htm" title="ma/makhadeva.htm">Makhādeva</a>, of how he renounced the world when gray hairs appeared on his head 
and became a recluse, enjoining on his eldest son to do likewise when the time 
came. Makhādeva developed the four Brahmavihārā and was reborn in the Brahma world. Eighty four thousand of his descendants, in unbroken succession, followed 
the tradition set by him; the last of the kings to do this was <a href="nimi.htm" title="n/nimi.htm">Nimi</a>, and his 
virtue having been remarked by the gods of <a href="taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a>, 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> invited him there. Nimi accepted the invitation, but later returned to earth to rule righteously and to observe the four fast days in each month. Nimi’s son was  <a href="kaalaarajanaka.htm">Kālārajanaka</a>, 
who broke the high tradition and proved the last of the line.</p>
<p>Makhādeva’s tradition led only to the Brahma world, but 
the teachings of the Buddha lead to Enlightenment and Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Makhādeva is identified with the Buddha. M.ii.74 ff.; cp.
