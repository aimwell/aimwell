<h2>Kāla-Buddharakkhita</h2>
<p>A Thera of Ceylon, an arahant. He 
belonged to a minister’s family and was born in a village near Dakkhinagiri-vihāra. 
When he came of age, he entered the Order, learned the whole of the Tipitaka, 
and, on going with a large concourse to see his teacher, was asked to give up 
his following and go into solitude to practise meditation. He went to the 
Vātakasitapabbata-vihāra, practised meditation and became an arahant. While 
living in the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra, he was once worshipping at the 
Kantaka-cetiya and was seated at the foot of a Kālatimabara tree. (Legend says 
on the night of the new moon, thus completing the circle of Kālas). One of the 
monks asked him a question on the Kālakārāma Sutta and the Elder preached a 
sermon based on the sutta. King Tissa (probably Saddhā-Tissa), who was in the 
vicinity, came to listen to the sermon, which lasted throughout the night; the 
king remained standing the whole time. Greatly pleased, the king, at the end of 
the sermon, offered the sovereignty of Ceylon to the monk.</p>
<p>It is said that the Elder had been the 
Nigantha Mahā-Saccaka in the time of the Buddha, and that the Buddha had 
preached to him the Mahā-Saccaka Sutta, not because he could understand it then, 
but because the Buddha knew that it would help him to rise to eminence in this 
last life as Kāla-Buddharakkhita. MA.i.469f</p>
