  <h2>MahÄ Ummagga JÄtaka (No. 546)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in MithilÄ as the son of 
Sirivaddhaka and SumanÄdevi. The child was born with a medicinal plant in his 
hand, and was therefore called Mahosadha. He talked immediately after birth, and 
it is said that, on the day of his conception, Videha, king of MithilÄ, dreamed 
a dream, which presaged the birth of a sage. From early childhood Mahosadha gave 
evidence of unusual ability, and one of his first acts was to build a large hall 
and lay out a garden with the help of his companions. The king wished to have 
him in the court though he was only seven years old, but was dissuaded by his 
wise men. But he sent a councillor to watch the boy and report of his doings 
from time to time. When the king was fully convinced (the JÄtaka gives an 
account of nineteen problems solved by Mahosadha) that Mahosadha was undoubtedly 
endowed with unusual wisdom, he sent for him in spite of the counsel of his 
ministers â€” Senaka, Pukkusa, KÄvÄ«nda and Devinda
-&nbsp; and appointed him as his fifth councillor. One 
day, Mahosadha saved the queen UdumbarÄ (q.v.) from the unjust wrath of the 
king, and ever after she was his firm and loyal friend. After his entry into the 
court, Mahosadha was on many occasions called upon to match his wit against that 
of the senior councillors, and on each occasion he emerged triumphant. E.g., in 
the MendakapaÃ±ha (q.v.) and the SirimandapaÃ±ha (q.v.). </p>
<p>When aged sixteen he married AmarÄdevÄ«. She was a wise 
woman, and frustrated many attempts of Mahosadhaâ€™s enemies to embroil him with 
the king. Once they stole various things from the palace and sent them to her. 
She accepted them, and made assignations with each of the donors. When they 
arrived she had them seized, their heads shaved, and themselves thrown into the 
jakes, where she tormented them, and then arraigned them before the king with 
the stolen goods. Mahosadha, aware of the plots against him, lay in hiding, and 
the deity of the kingâ€™s parasol put several questions to the king, knowing that 
none but Mahosadha could answer them. The king sent men to seek him, and he was 
discovered working for a potter. The king showed him all honour, and obtained 
from him the answers to the deityâ€™s questions.</p>
<p>But his enemies continued to plot against him, until 
orders were given by the king that he should be killed the next day. UdumbarÄ, 
discovered this and warned him. But in the meantime he had discovered the guilty 
secrets of his enemies: Senaka had killed a courtesan, Pukkusa had a leprous 
spot on his thigh, KÄvinda was possessed by a yakkha named Naradeva, and Devinda 
had stolen the kingâ€™s most precious gem. Mahosadha posted these facts everywhere 
in the city, and the next day went boldly into the palace. The king professed 
innocence of any evil intentions against him; but Mahosadha exposed the schemes 
of them all, and Senaka and the others were only saved from severe punishment by 
the intervention of Mahosadha himself. Thenceforward Mahosadha was Videhaâ€™s 
trusted councillor, and took various measures to increase his royal masterâ€™s 
power and glory. Spies were sent to every court, whence they brought home 
reports. Mahosadha also had a parrot whom he employed to ferret out the most 
baffling secrets. While returning from a visit to Sankhapala, king of Ekabala, 
the parrot passed through UttarapaÃ±cÄla and there overheard a conversation 
between CÅ«lani Brahmadatta, king of Kampilla, and his purohita Kevatta, wherein 
the latter unfolded a scheme for capturing the whole of JambudÄ«pa. Kevatta was 
too wise to allow Brahmadatta, to attack MithilÄ, knowing of Mahosadhaâ€™s power, 
but Mahosadha deliberately provoked Brahmadatta by sending his men to upset a 
feast he had prepared, during which he had planned to poison the hundred princes 
whom he had brought under subjection. Brahmadatta then set out to attack MithilÄ. 
He laid siege to the city, and adopted various ways of compelling the citizens 
to surrender. But Mahosadha was more than a match for him, and found means of 
defeating all his plans. In the end Mahosadha engaged the services of Anukevatta, 
who, pretending to be a traitor to MithilÄ, went over to the army of Brahmadatta 
and, gaining the kingâ€™s confidence, informed him that Kevatta and all the other 
counsellors of Brahmadatta had accepted bribes from Mahosadha. The king listened 
to him, and on his advice raised the siege and fled to his own city.</p>
<p>But Kevatta planned revenge, and, a year later, he 
persuaded Brahmadatta to send poets to Videhaâ€™s city, singing songs of the 
peerless beauty of the daughter of Brahmadatta, PaÃ±cÄlacandÄ«. Videha heard the 
songs and sent a proposal of marriage, and Kevatta came to MithilÄ to arrange 
the day. Videha suggested that Kevatta should meet Mahosadha to discuss the 
plans, but Mahosadha feigned illness, and when Kevatta arrived at his house, he 
was grossly insulted by Mahosadhaâ€™s men. When Kevatta had left, Videha consulted 
Mahosadha, but would not be dissuaded from his plan to marry PaÃ±cÄlacandÄ«. 
Finding that he could do nothing with the king, Mahosadha sent his parrot 
Matthara to find out what he could from the maynah bird which lived in 
Brahmadattaâ€™s bedchamber. Matthara used all his wits and won the favour of the 
maynah and learnt from her of Kevattaâ€™s plan, which he repeated to Mahosadha.</p>
<p>With Videhaâ€™s leave, Mahosadha went on UttarapaÃ±cÄla to, 
as he said, make preparations for the wedding. But he gave orders for a village 
to be built on every league of ground along the road, and gave instructions to 
the shipwright, Ä€nandakumÄra, to build and hold ready three hundred ships. At 
UttarapaÃ±cÄla he was received with great honour, and obtained the kingâ€™s 
permission to build in the city a palace for Videha. The king gave him a free 
hand, and be immediately started to threaten to pull down houses belonging to 
various people, from the queen mother downwards, and obtained money from them as 
bribes to spare their houses. Having reported to the king that no suitable spot 
was available within the city, he obtained his consent to erect a palace outside 
the city, between that and the Ganges. All access was forbidden to the site on 
penalty of a large sum, and having first erected a village called Gaggali for 
his workmen, elephants, etc., Mahosadha started to dig a tunnel, the mouth of 
which was in the Ganges. The tunnel, a marvellous place, was duly constructed, 
fitted with all manner of machinery, and beautifully decorated. A smaller tunnel 
was dug, leading into the larger, one opening, which was, however, concealed, 
giving access to the kingâ€™s palace. The task occupied four months, and when all 
preparations were complete, Mahosadha sent word to Videha.</p>
<p>Videha arrived at Brahmadattaâ€™s court, and a great feast 
was held in his honour at UpakÄrÄ«, the palace which had been prepared for his 
residence. While the feast was in progress, Mahosadha sent men by the smaller 
tunnel to the palace and bade them fetch TalatÄ (the queen mother), the queen 
NandÄ, and PaÃ±cÄlacandÄ«, on the pretext that they had been sent for by 
Brahmadatta to take part in the festivities as Videha and Mahosadha had both 
been killed, according to plan. Meanwhile Brahmadatta had given orders that the 
whole city should be surrounded. Videha was overcome with fright on discovering 
what was happening, but he put himself into Mahosadhaâ€™s hands. The latter led 
him into the large tunnel, and there he was brought face to face with the 
members of Brahmadattaâ€™s family, who had already been conducted thither. 
PaÃ±cÄlacandÄ« was placed upon a heap of treasure and married to Videha. On 
emerging from the tunnel, they were placed on board a waiting ship, with TÄlatÄ 
and NandÄ, and sent away into safety, escorted by the other ships, Mahosadha 
himself remaining behind in UttarapaÃ±cÄla.</p>
<p>The next day, Brahmadatta came with his army to UpakÄri, 
hoping to capture Videha. There Mahosadha revealed to him what had happened, 
and, in due course, persuaded him to forget his wrath and inspect the tunnel. 
While in the tunnel Brahmadatta expressed his remorse for having listened to the 
evil advice of Brahmadatta, and he and Mahosadha swore eternal friendship. 
Mahosadha returned to MithilÄ, taking with him Brahmadattaâ€™s dowry for his 
daughter; the members of Brahmadattaâ€™s family returned to UttarapaÃ±cÄla, and the 
two kings lived in great amity.</p>
<p>Videha died ten years later, and in fulfilment of a 
promise made to Brahmadatta, Mahosadha went to UttarapaÃ±cÄla. There NandÄ, who 
had never forgiven him, tried to poison the kingâ€™s mind against him; but this 
plot was frustrated by a religious woman, BherÄ« (q.v.), and Brahmadatta remained 
his firm friend, loving him, as he confessed to Bheri, more than any of his own 
family.</p>
