<p><b>Sarakāni (Saranāni). </b>A Sākyan. When he died the 
Buddha declared that he was a sotāpanna, bound for enlightenment. But many of 
the Sākyans spoke scornfully of him, saying that he had failed in the training 
and had taken to drink. Mahānāma reported this to the Buddha, who said that 
Sarakāni had, for a long time, taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the 
Sangha, and possessed qualities which secured him from birth in hell among the 
lowest animals and the peta world. S.v.375f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>1. Sarakāni (Saranāni) Sutta.</b> Mahānāma reports to 
the Buddha the rumours prevalent among the Sākyans regarding Sarakāni (q.v.). 
The Buddha says that Sarakāni had long since taken the Three Refuges, and he 
then goes on to describe various qualities, beginning from those which lead to 
the destruction of the āsavas to those, such as affection for the Buddha, which 
prevent men from going to the Downfall. S.v.375f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sarakāni Sutta.</b> Mahānāma brings to the Buddha’s 
notice that the Sākyans are surprised at the Buddha’s statement regarding the 
attainment of sotāpatti by Sarakāni. The Buddha then describes the virtues which 
make a man an anāgāmī, a sakadāgāmī or a sotāpanna. The Buddha’s doctrine is 
like a good field, well stubbed, the seeds sown therein capable of sprouting and 
happily planted, and the sky god supplying a constant rain. S.v.378f.</p>
