<p><b>1. Dhaniya, Dhanika.</b> A herdsman living 
on the bank of the river Mahī. He was a setthiputta of Dhammakonda in 
Pabbatarattha, which belonged to the kingdom of Videha. He had thirty thousand 
oxen and twenty thousand cows. He had seven sons and seven daughters and 
numerous retainers. In the dry season he lived on an island formed by the two 
forks of the river Mahī, and in the rainy season in a house on the upland. One 
day, while he was in this house, having finished his preparations for the 
approach of the rains, he sat meditating on his comfortable circumstances and 
broke forth into song in token of his happiness. The Buddha heard the song at 
Sāvatthi, seven hundred leagues away, and having travelled through the air, 
stood over Dhaniya’s dwelling. As Dhaniya proceeded with his song, the Buddha 
added a verse to each one of Dhaniya’s. At the end of this song Dhaniya, his 
wife, and two of his daughters, became sotāpannas. The Buddha then revealed 
himself and Dhaniya and his wife entered the Order. Later they became arahants 
and the cowherds erected for their use a monastery, which came to be called the 
Gokulanka-vihāra. SN.vv.18ff; SNA.i.26ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Dhaniya.</b>-A potter of Rājagaha. In his 
house the Buddha taught Pukkusāti the Cha-dhātu-vibhanga Sutta. Dhaniya, hearing 
that Pukkasāti had died an arahant the same night, was so impressed by the power 
of the Dhamma, that he entered the Order (Thag.v.228-30; Tha.gA.i.347f). He once 
made a grass but on the slopes of Isigili and lived there with several others 
during the rains. He continued to live there after the others had left. While he 
was away begging for alms, his hut was pulled down by women searching for straw 
and firewood, but he rebuilt it. Three times this happened, until, in 
exasperation, Dhaniya very skilfully made bricks and tiles and built a hut both 
strong and splendid, with tiles of shining crimson which gave out a bell-like 
sound when tapped. The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut 
to be pulled down. Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a 
guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to 
understand that he had the king’s permission. Vassakāra, hearing of this, 
reported the matter to <a href="bimbisara.htm" title="b/bimbisara.htm">Bimbisāra</a>, who sent for Dhaniya. Dhaniya maintained that 
the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal 
supplies of wood and other materials. Bimbisāra admitted the proclamation, but 
said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya 
away with a warning. The matter created a great uproar and the Buddha blamed 
Dhaniya. Vin.iii.41-5; Sp.ii.286.</p>
<p>Dhaniya later changed his ways and 
became an arahant. In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder and gave the 
Buddha a reed-chain (? nalamālā). He is probably identical with Nalamāliya of 
the Apadāna. Ap.ii.412.</p>
