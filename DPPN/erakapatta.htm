<p>A Nāga king. In the time of Kassapa 
Buddha he was a monk. One day, while in a boat, he grasped an eraka-leaf, and 
through his failing to let go, the leaf was broken off. Though he practised 
meditation for twenty thousand years in the forest, at the moment of his death 
he thought of the lapse with great remorse and was reborn in the Nāga world as 
large as a dug-out canoe, much to his grief and despair. When a daughter was 
born to him he taught her a song and, once a fortnight, he appeared with her on 
the surface of the Ganges, where she danced on his hood and sang the song. She 
was offered in marriage to anyone who could sing a reply to her song. Erakapatta 
hoped thereby to become aware of it when a Buddha should appear in the world. 
Many suitors came, and an interval between two Buddhas passed and still no one 
was successful. At last a young brahmin, Uttara (q.v.), well-schooled for the 
task by the Buddha, appeared before the</p>
<p>Nāga-maiden and answered all her 
questions. (Uttara himself became a sotāpanna when he finished learning his 
lesson from the Buddha.) Erakapatta at once knew that a Buddha had come, and 
asked Uttara to take him to the Teacher. At the sight of the Buddha, Erakapatta 
was seized with great sorrow on account of his condition, but the Buddha 
preached to him and consoled him. It is said that the Nāga king would have 
attained the Fruit of Conversion had it not been for his animal nature.
