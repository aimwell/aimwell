<p><b>1.</b><b> Vaccha.</b> A 
brahmin ascetic of long ago, near whose hut lived some Kinnaras. A spider used 
to weave his web around them, crack their heads and drink their blood. The 
Kinnaras sought Vaccha’s assistance, but Vaccha refused to kill the spider, till 
tempted by the offer of a Kinnara maiden named Rathavatī as his servant. Vaccha 
killed the spider and lived with Rathavatī as his wife.</p>
<p>This story was among those related by Mahosadha’s parrot 
Māthara to the mynah bird of the Pañcāla king’s palace, to show her that in love 
there is no unlikeness — a man may well mate 
with a Kinnari, a parrot with a mynah. J.vi.422.</p>

<p><b>2. Vaccha. </b>See Kisavaecha, Nandavaccha, 
Pilindavaccha, Tirītavaccha, Vacchagotta, etc. Also Ukkhepakatavaocha and the 
two Vanavacchas.</p>
