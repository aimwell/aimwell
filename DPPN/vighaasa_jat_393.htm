<p>Once seven brothers of a Kāsi village renounced the world 
and lived as ascetics in Mejjhārañña, but they were given up to various 
amusements. The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, saw this, and, assuming the form of a 
parrot, visited them and sang the praises of the ascetic life. They expressed 
their joy at being thus praised, but the parrot went on to make them understand 
that their lives were useless; they were mere refuse eaters and not ascetics.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the monks mentioned 
in the Pāsādakampana Sutta (q.v.). The monks are identified with the seven 
ascetics. J.iii.310f.</p>
