<p>The Bodhisatta was born in Macala under 
the name of Magha. He spent his time with the heads of the other twenty-nine 
families in the village, engaged in various forms of social service. The 
headman, finding his gains diminish, made a false report to the king, who 
ordered Magha and his friends to be trampled by elephants; but by virtue of 
their mettā they could not be killed, and thereupon the king showed them great 
favour. After death they were all born in Tāvatimsa, with Magha as Sakka. 
</p>
<p>Three of Magha’s wives — Sudhammā, Cittā 
and Nandā — who had persuaded him to let them share in his good work, were born 
as Sakka’s handmaidens. But Sujātā, who had taken no part in their activities, 
received no such honour. At that time the Asuras shared Tāvatimsa with the 
Devas, but one day they got drunk and were hurled down to the foot of Sineru. 
They therefore declared war on the Devas, and during one of their fierce battles 
Sakka was defeated and fled over the sea in his chariot Vejayanta. When he came 
to Simbalivana, the chariot felled down the trees there, and the young Garulas 
were hurled into the sea. Hearing their cries of agony, Sakka made his driver, 
Mātali, turn the chariot and go back. The Asuras, seeing him return, thought it 
was another Sakka coming with reinforcements, and fled in terror. The 
Vejayanta-pāsāda rose from the earth, and Sakka lived in it, having fortified 
his city with a fivefold guard.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who had drunk water without first straining it, because his friend, with 
whom he was travelling and with whom he had fallen out, had the only strainer 
available. Mātali is identified with Ānanda (J.i.198ff; with the introductory 
story cp. Vin.ii.118).</p>
<p>In the version given in the Dhammapada 
Commentary (i.263ff; see also SA.i.260f; DA.iii.710ff; and SNA.ii.484f; 
according to these accounts Sakka was helped by not 29 but 33 others), the story 
of Magha is related in response to a question asked of the Buddha by the 
Licchavi Mahāli. The reason given for Sakka’s flight in the Vejayantaratha also 
differs. According to this account, when Sujātā (q.v.) was reborn as the 
daughter of Vepacitti and the time came for her to choose a husband, Sakka went 
to the assembly in the guise of an aged Asura and was chosen by Sujātā. Sakka 
thereupon revealed himself and fled with his bride in the chariot, the Asuras in 
full chase.</p>
