<p>One of the five bankers (setthi) of 
limitless wealth in Bimbisāra’s kingdom, the others being Jotiya, Jatila, 
Mendaka, and Punnaka (DhA.i.385; AA.i.220). He was once very poor, and 
Mahā-Kassapa, having spent seven days in samādhi, stood at his door, wishing to 
do him a favour. Kākavaliya’s wife saw the Elder and poured into his bowl the 
saltless sour gruel she had cooked for her husband. The Elder took it and put it 
into the hands of the Buddha, who resolved that it should suffice for the large 
assembly of monks. On the seventh day after that, Kākavaliya was appointed 
setthi (Vsm.ii.403). He is quoted as an example of one who was able to give 
gifts which bore fruit in this very existence, because his gift contained the 
four purities: lawful acquisition, greatness of volition, virtue in the 
recipient and consummate virtue in the giver. DhsA.161f; see also AA.i.48, 364.</p>
