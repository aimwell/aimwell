<p>1. Upatissagāma.-A brahmin village near 
Rājagaha. It was the birthplace of Sāriputta (ThagA.ii.93; DhA.i.73). Its real 
name was Nālaka (q.v.), but it was called Upatissagāma, evidently because its 
chieftains belonged to the Upatissa clan. It is probable that Sāriputta’s 
father, who was head of the village (gāmasāmi), was also called Upatissa. See 
SnA.i.326.</p>
<p>2. Upatissagāma (sometimes called 
Upatissanagara).-The settlement founded by Vijaya’s chaplain, Upatissa, on the 
banks of the Gambhīra-nadī, about seven miles to the north of Anurādhapura 
(Mhv.vii.44; Mhv.Trs.58, n.4; Dpv.ix.36; x.5). It was the seat of government 
till Anurādhapura became the capital (See, e.g., Mhv.viii.4; x.48). Soon after 
Mahinda’s arrival in Ceylon many young men joined the Order, and among them 
there were five hundred from Upatissagāma (Mhv.xvii.60).</p>
