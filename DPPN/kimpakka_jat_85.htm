<p>The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a 
caravan. During a journey through a forest he gave orders to his men not to eat 
any fruit without his leave. Seeing the fruit of a kimpakka-tree, which in 
appearance and flavour resembled a mango, some of the men ate of the fruit and 
died in spite of efforts to save them.</p>
<p>The story was related to a monk who was 
stirred to lust by the sight of a beautifully dressed woman in Sāvatthi. Lusts 
of the senses are like the fruit of the kimpakka-tree, sweet and attractive in 
the hour of enjoyment, but leading later to death. J.i.367f</p>
