<p>He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi and joined the Order, 
believing that there he would find pleasure and comfort. He was lazy and 
indolent, but the Buddha, discerning his antecedents, admonished him, and Nita, 
developing insight, became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin teacher 
named Sunanda.  </p>
<p>One day, as he prepared a Vājapeyya sacrifice, the Buddha visited 
him and walked through the air above him. Sunanda threw flowers in the sky, and 
they formed a canopy over the whole town.</p>
<p>He became king thirty five times under 
the name of <a href="abbhasa.htm" title="am/abbhasa.htm">Abbhasa</a> (v.l. Ambaramsa). Thag.vs.84; 
ThagA.i.180f.</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Puppachadanīya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.166.</p>
