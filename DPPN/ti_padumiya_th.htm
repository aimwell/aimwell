<p>An arahant. In the time of Padumuttara 
Buddha he was garland-maker to the king, and, seeing the Buddha, while on his 
way to the palace, he threw up into the air three lotuses, which formed a canopy 
over the Buddha. </p>
<p>Ti-padumiya was reborn as a deva, and 
owned a palace called Mahāvitthārika, which was three hundred leagues high.
