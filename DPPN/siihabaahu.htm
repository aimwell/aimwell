<p>Father of <a href="vijaya.htm" title="vy/vijaya.htm">Vijaya</a>.  </p>
<p>According to legend, his father was a 
lion and his mother a princess of <a href="vanga.htm" title="va/vanga.htm">Vanga</a> (see 
<a href="susiimaa.htm" title="s/susiimaa.htm">Susīmā</a>). His hands and feet were 
like a lion’s paws. He had a sister, <a href="siihasiivali.htm" title="s/siihasiivali.htm">Sīhasīvalī</a>.  </p>
<p>When he was sixteen he escaped 
with his mother and sister and arrived in the capital of Vanga. Later he killed 
his father for a reward and was offered the throne of Vanga.  </p>
<p>He refused this and 
founded a city, <a href="siihapura.htm" title="s/siihapura.htm">Sīhapura</a>, in his native country of 
<a href="laala.htm" title="l/laala.htm">Lāla</a>, and there lived with 
Sīhasīvalī, whom he made his consort. They had thirty two children, of whom 
Vijaya was the eldest and Sumitta the second. Dpv.ix.2-6; Mhv.vi.11f , 24-38; 
viii.2, 6.</p>
