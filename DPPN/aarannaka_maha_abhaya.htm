<p>A monk. For twelve years a devotee gave 
him his requisites including cloth for his robes; but a thief, Harantika, always 
stole the cloth. Discovering this, the devotee caught the rogue, beat him 
soundly, and, having tied him to a corpse, warned the villagers that a Yakkha 
would be prowling about that night, calling himself Harantika. The villagers 
fastened their doors and gave him no admission, even his wife refusing to 
recognise his voice. Then Harantika went to Mahāabhaya, and having confessed his 
guilt, asked for protection. Mahāabhaya bathed him in warm water and rubbed oil 
on his body, saying it was not his business to take revenge. Harantika later 
became a monk and attained arahantship. Ras.ii.5f.</p>
