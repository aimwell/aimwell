<p>A Niraya. It resembled a city with four 
gates and a wall. Mittavindaka, arriving at Ussaka in his wanderings, saw there 
a man supporting a wheel as sharp as a razor, which to Mittavindaka appeared 
like a lotus-flower. Mittavindaka took it from him, and realising then what it 
was, tried to escape, but was unsuccessful. This was the suffering undergone by 
those who had smitten their mothers. Sakka, during a visit to Ussaka, saw 
Mittavindaka, but could do nothing for him (J.iv.3f; iii.206f).</p>
<p>Ussada was considered a place of great 
suffering (E.g., J.iv.403), and also a place where those who, having promised a 
gift fail to give it, are born (J.iv.405). Once the Bodhisatta was born in 
Ussada, for cruelty during his reign as king of Benares, and he suffered for 
eighty thousand years (J.vi.2). Beings born there have their tongues pierced 
with glowing hooks and are dragged about on a floor of heated metal (J.vi.112).</p>
<p>In the scholiast to the Matakabhatta 
Jātaka (J.i.168) reference is made to sixteen Ussada-nirayā.</p>
<p>Revatī (q.v.) was once cast into 
Ussada-niraya. VvA.223.</p>
