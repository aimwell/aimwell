<p>Once the Bodhisatta was appraiser to the 
king of Benares, with whom he always dealt fairly. The king was greedy, and 
thinking that his appraiser paid too much for things bought for the palace, he 
appointed in his place a rustic, whom he happened to see passing. This man fixed 
prices according to his own fancy. One day a dealer brought five hundred horses 
from Uttarāpatha, and the appraiser valued the whole lot at a single measure of 
rice. The horse-dealer sought the Bodhisatta’s advice, who suggested that the 
appraiser should be asked to value a measure of rice. The horse-dealer went to 
the king, and, in the presence of the court, asked the appraiser the value of 
one measure of rice. The man replied that it was worth all Benares and its 
suburbs. The ministers laughed, thus putting the king to shame. He dismissed the 
fool and reinstated the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Lāludāyi, who had a dispute with Dabba Mallaputta regarding the distribution of 
food tickets. The monks thereupon asked Lāludāyi to undertake the task. This he 
did so badly that great confusion ensued, and the matter was reported to the 
Buddha, who related the above story to show that in the past, too, his stupidity 
had deprived others of their profit.</p>
<p>Lāludāyi is identified with the false 
appraiser. J.i.123-26.</p>
