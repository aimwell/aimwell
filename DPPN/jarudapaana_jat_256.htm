<p>The Bodhisatta was once travelling with 
a large caravan. In a wood they came across a disused well and, needing water, 
dug it deeper. There they came across buried treasure, but the men, not being 
satisfied, dug deeper, in spite of the Bodhisatta’s warning.</p>
<p>A Nāga-king who lived there was 
disturbed and slew all except the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
some arahants of Sāvatthi, who, on their way back from there, after having 
entertained the Buddha, saw the same well and found treasure there. They, 
however, were satisfied with their find and reported it to the Buddha 
(J.ii.294f).</p>
