<p><b>1. Soreyya. </b>A town where Soreyya-Revata lived 
(Vin.ii.299). In the time of the Buddha there was a caravan route between 
Soreyya and <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> (DhA.i.326). There was also a direct route from 
<a href="veranjaa.htm" title="vy/veranjaa.htm">Verañjā</a> to 
<a href="payaga.htm" title="pa/payaga.htm">Payāgatittha</a>, passing through Soreyya, 
<a href="sankassa.htm" title="sa/sankassa.htm">Sankassa</a> and <a href="kannakujja.htm" title="ka/kannakujja.htm">Kannakuja</a> (Vin.iii.11; see 
also <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Soreyya-Revata</a>).</p>
<p>At one time <a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāyana</a> lived near Soreyya (DhA.i.325). 
It was evidently a very ancient city, for <a href="anomadassii.htm" title="ay/anomadassii.htm">Anomadassī</a> Buddha is mentioned as 
having twice preached there once to King <a href="isidatta.htm" title="i_/isidatta.htm">Isidatta</a> and again to the king of 
Soreyya; and it was there that he held his first assembly of monks (BuA.143, 
144). <a href="vessabhuu.htm" title="vy/vessabhuu.htm">Vessabhū</a> Buddha also preached there later to a very large assembly 
(BuA.206).</p>

<p><b>2. Soreyya.</b> A setthiputta of Soreyya. Once, when he 
and a friend with a large retinue were driving out of the city to bathe, he saw 
<a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāyana</a> adjusting his robe before entering the city for alms. Soreyya saw 
the Elder’s body, and wished that he could make him his wife or that his wife’s 
body might become in colour like the Elder’s. Immediately Soreyya turned into a 
woman, and, hiding from his companions, went with a caravan bound for 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>. 
Arrived at Takkasilā, he became the wife of the Treasurer of that city and had 
two sons. He had already two sons in Soreyya, born to him before his 
transformation.  </p>
<p>Some time after, he saw his former friend driving in a carriage 
through Takkasilā, and, sending a slave woman to him, invited him to the house 
and entertained him. The friend was unable to recognize him till he revealed the 
truth. Thereupon they both returned to Soreyya and invited Mahā Kaccāyana to a 
meal. Soreyya fell at his feet, confessed his fault, and asked for forgiveness. 
When the Elder pardoned him, he once more became a man. He entered the Order 
under the Elder and went with him to <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. There people having heard his 
story worried him with questions. He therefore retired into solitude, and, 
developing insight, became an arahant. Before that, when people asked him which 
of his children he loved best, he would say: “Those to whom I gave birth while a 
woman”; but after attaining arahantship he would say: “My affections are set on 
no one.” DhA.i.324ff.</p>
