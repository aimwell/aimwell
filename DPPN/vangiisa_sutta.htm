<hr>
<p><b>1. Vangīsa Sutta. </b>Preached by the Buddha at 
Aggālava cetiya. Vangīsa’s teacher, Nigrodhakappa, had just died there, and 
Vangīsa asks the Buddha if he had attained Nibbāna. Vangīsa’s question is really 
a poem in itself, containing ten verses, in praise of the Buddha. The Buddha 
says that Kappa has won Nibbāna, because he had severed all the bonds of Māra. 
Vangīsa then declares that Kappa attained that state because he followed the 
Buddha’s teaching. SN. pp. 59ff.; the verses of the sutta are included in the 
Theragāthā (1263 79).</p>
<p>In the Commentary (SNA.i.345) the sutta is called 
Nigrodhakappa Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vangīsa Sutta. </b>A set of ten verses, spoken by 
Vangīsa at Jetavana, soon after winning arahantship, as he sat experiencing the 
bliss of emancipation. He congratulates himself on having become a disciple of 
the Buddha. S.i.196; the verses are included in Thag.1253-62.</p>
