<p>He belonged to a rich landowner’s family of Rājagaha and 
was the nephew of Sirigutta. He saw the Buddha subdue the elephant, Dhanapāla, 
and, much impressed, entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course. One 
day, rising from his seat to recite the Pātimokkha, he took a painted fan (Cf. 
Khujjuttarā, DhA.i.209) and, reseating himself, he spoke eight verses in 
admonition of the monks and by way of confessing his aññā. Thag.vss.502-9; 
ThagA.i.488f.</p>
