<p><b>1. Candagutta.</b>-King of <a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>. He 
belonged to the Moriya dynasty and gained the throne through the scheming of Cānakka, who slew the rightful king DhanĀnanda and his heir Pabbata. (The 
Mahāvamsatīkā gives details of how Cānakka contrived to make Candagutta king 
(pp.181ff)). Candagutta reigned twenty-four years and was succeeded by his son 
<a href="bindusara.htm" title="b/bindusara.htm">Bindusāra</a>. His grandson was 
<a href="asoka.htm" title="ay/asoka.htm">Asoka</a> (Mhv.v.16ff). Candagutta’s senior contemporary in Ceylon was Pandukābhaya, who died in the 
fourteenth year of Candagutta’s reign (Dpv.vi.15; 
Sp.i.72; see also Dpv.v.69, 73, 81; both the Dpv. and the Sp. talk of 
Pakundakābhaya (sic)). The Milinda (p.292; see also Kathāsaritsāgara i.30) 
mentions a soldier Bhaddasāla, in the service of the Nanda royal family, who 
waged war against Candagutta. In this war there were eighty “Corpse Dances” in 
which dead bodies danced. The Theragāthā Commentary (i., p.440) states that the 
father of the Thera Tekic-Chakāri incurred the displeasure of Candagutta, who, 
at the instigation of Cānakka, cast him into prison.</p>

Mahā Kassapa Thera. His colleague was Suriyagutta. SA.iii.125.</p>

<p><b>3. Candagutta.</b>-One of the eight khattiyas sent by Asoka to accompany the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon. He took a 
prominent part in the celebrations when the Tree left Pātaliputta (Mbv.152), and 
later, on his arrival in Ceylon, was appointed by Davānaippiyatissa to beat the 
golden drum at the Bodhi-tree ceremonies. He was given the office of Malayarāja 
and the Virabāhujanapada was bestowed on him for his maintenance (Mbv.165).</p>
<hr>
