<p>The city of birth of Sumana Buddha and the scene of his 
first sermon to Sarana and Bhāvitatta (Bu.v.21; BuA.125f). It was there that 
Mangala Buddha converted his chief disciples, Sudeva and Dhammasena (BuA.120). 
Revata Buddha once preached there to an assembly of one thousand crores of 
people (BuA.134), while later, King Uggata built, for Sobhita Buddha, the 
Dhammaganārāma in the same city (BuA.139).</p>
