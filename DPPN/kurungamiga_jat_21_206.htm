<p><b>1. Kurungamiga Jātaka (No.21).-</b>Once the 
Bodhisatta was an antelope who used to eat the fruit of a sepanni-tree. One day 
a huntsman discovered him and lay in wait to kill him, but the Bodhisatta 
suspected his presence and so escaped death.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta’s</a> plots to kill the Buddha, the huntsman being identified with 
Devadatta. J.i.173f.</p>

<p><b>2. Kurungamiga Jātaka (No.206).</b>-In a 
forest lived three friends: an antelope, a woodpecker and a tortoise. One night 
the antelope was caught in a huntsman’s noose, and the tortoise set about biting 
through the thongs of the noose while the woodpecker, uttering cries of 
ill-omen, kept the huntsman in his hut. The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, 
exhausted by his labours, was caught by the huntsman. The antelope thereupon 
enticed the hunter into the forest and, eluding him, released the tortoise. The 
antelope was the Bodhisatta, Sāriputta the woodpecker, Moggallāna the tortoise 
and <a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a> the hunter.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Devadatta’s wickedness (J.ii.152ff; DhA.iii.152f). </p>
<p>This Jātaka is figured on the Bharhut 
Stupa. Cunningham: p.67 and PL xxvii.9.</p>
