<p>Once, two friends, a lion 
and a tiger, lived in a cave. They had a dispute as to which was the cold part 
of the month, the dark half or the light, and they referred the matter to a 
hermit (the Bodhisatta), who said that the cold was caused by wind and not by 
light or darkness.</p>
<p>The story was told to two forest dwelling monks of Kosala, 
K훮la and Junha, who consulted the Buddha in a similar dispute. The lion and the 
tiger are identified with the monks. J.i.164ff.</p>
