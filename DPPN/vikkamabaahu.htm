<p><b>1. Vikkamabāhu, Vikkamabhuja, Vikkantabāhu.</b> 
Surnames of King Kassapa VI. See Kassapa (21).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vikkamabāhu. </b>Son of Vijayabāhu I. and 
Tilokasundarī. He had two wives, Sundarī and Līlāvatī (Cv.lix.32, 49f). He was 
made Adipāda by Vijayabāhu I., and, when his son Gajabāhu was born, the king 
gave the province of Rohana for his welfare. Vikkamabāhu lived there with 
Mahānāgahula (Cv.lx.88f) as his capital. When Vijayabāhu died, some of 
Vikkamabāhu’s relations, Jayabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (Mānābharana, 
Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha) conspired to keep him out of the succession, 
but he defeated them in various battles and took possession of the capital 
Pulatthipura, losing, however, Dakkhinadesa and his former province of Rohana 
(Cv.lxi.2f). A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by Mānābharana, 
and, as Vikkamabāhu advanced to Kalyanī to fight them, Vīradeva, of Palandīpa 
(q.v.) landed in Mannāra, and his attention was diverted. In the first 
engagements, Vikkamabāhu was defeated by Vīradeva and forced to flee to 
Kotthasāra, but Vīradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika. From 
then onwards Vikkamabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (see above) lived each in 
his province, but became unpopular both with the sangha and the laity owing to 
their greed and lust. Following the death of Jayabāhu and the Queen Mittā, 
Vikkamabāhu appears to have been acknowledged king (Vikkamabāhu II.); and it was 
evidently as such that the birth of his nephew, the prince who after became 
Parakkamabāhu. I., was reported to him. Vikkamabāhu had two sons, Mahinda, and 
Gajabāhu, but asked that his nephew should be sent to the court; this request, 
however, was not granted (Cv.lxii.58f). Vikkamabāhu reigned, till his death, for 
twenty one years (1116 1137 A.C.), and was succeeded by his son Gajabāhu. 
Cv.lxiii.18.</p>

<p><b>3. Vikkamabāhu.</b> Son of Gajabāhu and brother of 
Colagangakumāra. Cv.lxx.238.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Vikkamabāhu.</b> Younger brother of King 
Kittinissanka. He became king on the death of Vīrabāhu I., but reigned for only 
three months (in 1196 A.C.), after which he was slain by Codaganga. Cv.lxxx.28.</p>
<p><b>5. Vikkamabāhu.</b> The king who succeeded 
Parakkamabāhu V. He was himself succeeded by Bhuvenakabāhu V. Cv.xci. 1, 3; he 
seems to have reigned for eighteen years (1347 75 A.C.). See Cv. Trs. ii.212, 
n.2.</p>
