<p><b>1. Sumedhā Theri.</b> She was the daughter of King 
Koñca of Mantāvatī. When she came of age, her parents let Anikadatta, king of 
Vāranavatī, see her. But she had frequent association with nuns, and cut off her 
hair by herself, and then, concentrating her attention on the idea of the 
“foul,” she attained the first jhāna. When her parents entered her room with 
Anikadatta, she converted them all, and obtained permission to join the Order. 
Shortly afterwards she attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Konāgamana Buddha she and her friends 
(afterwards Dhanañjānī and Khemā), clansmen’s daughters, agreed together to have 
a large monastery built, and this they made over to the Buddha and the Order. In 
the time of Kassapa Buddha she belonged to a very rich family and was a friend 
of the seven daughters of Kikī. Thig.vs.448-522; ThigA.272f.; Ap.ii.512f.; cf. 
545 (vs. 24).</p>
