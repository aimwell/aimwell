  <h2>Kotisanthāra</h2>

</ul>
<p>In the Jātakas mention is made (E.g., 
J.iii.18; 375, 397; J.iv.113) of the Buddha when he wished to address the monks 
of Jetavana, asking Ānanda to summon them to the Kotisanthāra and ordering that 
a seat be prepared for him at the entrance to the Gandhakuti. </p>
<p>Kotisanthāra was probably the name given 
to that part of the Jetavana grounds just outside the Buddha’s own apartments. 
It may have been so called in reference to the fact that Anāthapindika bought 
the land by spreading on it a crore of kahāpanas (kahāpana-koti-santhārena) 
(J.i.94). Or the name may have been 
restricted to the part actually covered by the pieces of money, for we are told 
(Vin.ii.159) that the money was not sufficient to cover the whole of the ground.
</p>
<p>There were buildings in the Kotisanthāra, 
the monks living in these buildings being referred to as “Antokotisanthāre 
vasantā.” (E.g., J.iv.113) </p>
<p>Kotisanthāra is generally translated as 
The Golden Pavement, (E.g., Jāt. Trs.iii.12; iv.71) which seems to be a wrong 
rendering.</p>
