<h4>1. NandopĀnanda</h4>
<p>A <a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">Nāga</a> king, tamed by 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a>. The Buddha and five 
hundred monks, on their way to <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">Tāvatimsa</a> one morning, travelled over the Nāga 
king’s abode as he was having a meal. In anger, the Nāga coiled round Sineru and 
covered the road to Tāvatimsa..</p>
<p>Thereupon several members of the Buddha’s retinue, 
including <a href="ratthapala.htm" title="r/ratthapala.htm">Ratthapāla</a>, 
<a href="bhaddiya.htm" title="b/bhaddiya.htm">Bhaddiya</a> and <a href="raahula.htm" title="r/raahula.htm">Rāhula</a>, offered to quell the Nāga’s power, 
but the Buddha would not agree until Moggallāna sought permission to do so. It 
is said that no other monk had the power to face all the dangers created by the Naga and remain unscathed. Moggallanā and NandopĀnanda vied with one another in 
the exhibition of their iddhi power, and, in the end, NandopĀnanda had to 
acknowledge defeat. He was thereupon conducted to the Buddha, whose follower he 
became. When <a href="anaathapindika.htm" title="ay/anaathapindika.htm">Anāthapindika</a> heard of Moggallana’s victory, he celebrated it by 
holding a great alms festival, lasting for seven days, for the Buddha and his 
monks. ThagA.ii.188f.; J.v.126.</p>
<p>In the Divyāvadāna (p.395) Nanda and Upananda are spoken 
of as two Nāga kings.</p>
