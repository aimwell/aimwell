<p>A cave on the <a href="vediya.htm" title="vy/vediya.htm">Vediya</a> mountain, to the 
north of <a href="ambasandaa.htm" title="am/ambasandaa.htm">Ambasandā</a>, which was a brahmin village, east of  
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>. Once, when 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> was staying there, 
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a> visited him and asked him the questions 
recorded in the <a href="sakkapanha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sakkapanha_sutta.htm">Sakkapañha Sutta</a> (D.ii.263).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (DA.iii.697) that the 
cave lay between two overhanging rocks, with a large sāla-tree at the entrance. 
The village community had added walls with doors and windows and had ornamented 
it with polished plaster scroll-work and garlands and had presented it to the 
Buddha. </p>
<p>In Fa Hsien’s time (Giles, 48f), it was 
still inhabited and he describes it as being one yojana north-east of 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a>. 
<a href="hiuen_tsang.htm" title="h/hiuen_tsang.htm">Hiouen Thsang</a>, however, found it deserted. He calls it Indraka-saila-gūhā (Beal 
ii.180-1). </p>
<p>Both pilgrims noticed marks on the rock; 
according to Fa Hsien they were the answers to Sakka’s questions written by the 
Buddha with his finger, while Hiouen Thsang says that both questions and answers 
were written on the stone.</p>
<p>The cave is identified with one about 
two miles to the south-west of the modern village of Giriyek. (CAGI. 539ff; 
Stein, Ind. Antiq. 1901, p.54).</p>
<p>It is said that on the occasion of the 
preaching of the Sakkapañha Sutta, eight hundred million devas realised the 
Truth (Mil.349).</p>
