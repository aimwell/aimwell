<p>A girl eats the eggs of a hen, the hen 
conceives a grudge against her and is reborn as a cat, who eats the eggs of the 
hen, who is the girl reborn. For five hundred births they thus return hatred for 
hatred. Finally the girl is reborn in Sāvatthi as a woman, and the hen as an 
ogress. The ogress eats two of the woman’s children, and is about to eat the 
third when the woman seeks refuge in the monastery. The Buddha admonished them 
to return good for evil and they become friends. DhA.iii.449f; cp. the story of 
Kālī (6).</p>
