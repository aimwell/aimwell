  <h2>Pindapātadāyaka Tissa</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the four names given to Vanavāsī Tissa (that being 
the last), because, when he came to Sāvatthi, the citizens vied with one another 
to do him honour, and in two days he was given one thousand bowls of alms and 
one thousand garments, all of which he gave to the Order. This was due to his 
having given in a previous birth a piece of cloth to an Elder. DhA.ii.88.</p>
