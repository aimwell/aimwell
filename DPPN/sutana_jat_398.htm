<p>The Bodhisatta was once a poor householder, named Sutana, 
and supported his parents. One day the king of Benares went hunting, and, after 
chasing a deer, killed it, and was returning with the carcase when he passed 
under a tree belonging to the Yakkha <a href="makhadeva.htm" title="ma/makhadeva.htm">Makhādeva</a>, who, by the power conferred on 
him by <a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a>, claimed him as his food. The king was set free on condition 
that he sent one man daily to the Yakkha for food. As time went on, no one could 
be found to take rice to the Yakkha, because all knew what awaited them. Then 
the king offered one thousand, and the Bodhisatta, for the sake of his parents 
and against his mother’s wishes, consented to go. Before going he obtained from 
the king his slippers, his umbrella, his sword, and his golden bowl filled with 
rice. Sutana then approached the Yakkha’s tree, and, with the point of his 
sword, pushed the bowl of rice to him. The Yakkha then started talking to Sutana and was very pleased 
with him. Sutana exhorted him to give up his evil ways, and returned to Benares 
with the Yakkha, who was given a settlement at the city gate and provided with 
rich food.</p>
