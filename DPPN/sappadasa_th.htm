  <h2>Sappadāsa Thera</h2>

<p>He was born in Kapilavatthu as the son of Suddhodana’s 
chaplain. He received faith on the occasion of the Buddha’s visit to his own 
people, and entered the Order. Overmastered by corrupt habits of mind and 
character, for twenty five years he was unable to develop concentration. This so 
distressed him that he was about to commit suicide, when, inward vision suddenly 
expanding, he attained arahantship (Thag. vs. 405 10. ThagA.i.448f). According 
to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.256f), he tried to kill himself by making a 
snake, caught by the monks, bite him. But the snake refused to bite, in spite of 
all efforts to provoke him. Sappadāsa then threw it away, thinking it to be non 
poisonous. But the other monks declared it was a cobra, because they had seen 
its hood and heard its hissing.</p>
<p>Sappadāsa acted as barber to the monastery, and, one day, 
taking a razor, he applied it to his windpipe as he leaned against a tree. And 
then he thought how blameless his life had been and was filled with joy. 
Thereupon he developed insight and became an arahant. When the monks reported 
this to the Buddha, the Buddha said that the snake had been the Elder’s slave in 
his third previous life, and therefore did not dare bite him. This incident gave 
the monk his name, Sappadāsa.</p>
