  <h2>Uddālaka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Son of the Bodhisatta (then chaplain of 
the king of Benares) and a slave-girl, whom he first met in the royal park. The 
boy was so called because he was conceived under an uddāla-tree. When grown up 
he went to Takkasilā and later became leader of a large company of ascetics. In 
the course of their travels he and his followers came to Benares, where they 
received great favours from the people. Attracted by his reputation, the king 
once visited him with the royal chaplain. On that occasion Uddālaka arranged 
that he and his followers should feign to be very holy men given up to various 
austerities. The chaplain, seeing through their dishonesty and discovering the 
identity of Uddālaka, persuaded him to leave his asceticism and become chaplain 
under him (J.iv.298-304).</p>
