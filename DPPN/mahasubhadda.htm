he was the elephant king Chaddanta. J.v.37, 39.</p>

<p><b>2. Mahāsubhaddā.</b> Eldest daughter of Anāthapindika. 
Before her marriage she waited on the monks who came to her father’s house and 
became a sotāpanna (DhA.i.128; J.i.93). According to the Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.i.146, 148f ) she married an unbeliever, a householder of Ugganagara, and 
the Buddha, at her request, went to her house with five hundred monks (chief 
among whom was Kundadhāna) to receive alms. But see Cūla Subhaddā.</p>
