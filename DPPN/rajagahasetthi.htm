<p>Evidently not a proper name, but the title of the Treasurer of Rājagaha (See, 
e.g., DhA.i.232). In the time of the Buddha, the setthi was the brother in law 
of Anāthapindika and was a devout follower of the Buddha; he was responsible for 
the meeting between the Buddha and Anāthapindika (For details see 
Anāthapindika). He had a slave girl named Punnā (DhA.iii.321ff ) and a slave 
Punna, who later became a setthi, and whose daughter, Uttarā, was given in 
marriage to the son of the Rājagahasetthi. This latter was an unbeliever, but 
was later converted and became a sotāpanna. See VvA.63ff. for details.</p>
