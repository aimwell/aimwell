  <h2>Kāyaviratigāthā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A beautiful Pāli poem, of two hundred 
and seventy-four verses, on the subjection of sensuality, written in Ceylon, 
probably in the seventeenth century. A tika on the poem is ascribed to a monk of 
Pakudhanagara (Pegu). (Gv.65, 75; Bode, op. cit., 44, n.7).</p>
<p>The work is in two sections, the first 
describing the formation of the body, its foulness and its worthlessness, and 
the second dealing with the mind and the advantages of developing the same 
regardless of the body. There is a Sinhalese translation probably by the author 
himself. P.L.C.285.</p>
