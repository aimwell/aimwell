<h4>1. Parābhava Sutta</h4>
<p>The sixth sutta of the Sutta Nipāta, preached on the day 
after that of the preaching of the Mangala Sutta. In the latter the Buddha had 
spoken of the ways of progress; the devas then wished to hear how beings 
deteriorated, and, at their request, Sakka sent a deva to ask the Buddha who, 
thereupon, preached this discourse. It is said that at the conclusion of the 
sutta countless beings realized the Truth. SNA.i.169 74.</p>
<p>The sutta deals with various causes, which lead to the 
decay and corruption of beings. Having well considered all the various ways of 
destruction, the wise man avoids them and, being endowed with insight, attains 
to happiness. SN.vs.91-115.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Parābhava Sutta</h4>
<p>Seven conditions that bring about loss. A.iv.26f.</p>
