<p>1. Āyu Sutta.-Preached at the 
Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha. The Buddha tells the monks that human life is very 
brief and has its sequel elsewhere. Therefore good must be done and the holy 
life must be lived. Mars approaches the Buddha and suggests that men should take 
no heed of death, but should enjoy life like a babe replete with milk. The 
Buddha points out to him the error of such a view (S.i.108).</p>
<p>2. Āyu Sutta.-Preached at the same 
place, on another occasion. Māra utters the same sentiment and the Buddha 
refutes his views. Māra retires vanquished. S.i.108-9.</p>
