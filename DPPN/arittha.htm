<p><b>1. Arittha.</b>-A monk. He had been 
subjected by the Sangha to the ukkhepanīyakamma for refusal to renounce a sinful 
doctrine, namely, that the states of mind declared by the Buddha to be 
stumbling-blocks are not such at all for him who indulges in them.</p>
<p>Arittha left the Order and would not 
come back until the ukkhepanīyakamma was revoked (Vin.ii.25-8).</p>
<p>He was a vulture-trainer (gaddhabādhiputta) 
(See note in VT.ii.377).</p>
<p>His case is cited as that of a pācittaya-offence 
because he refused to give up a wrong doctrine even after the monks had three 
times requested him to do so (Vin.iv.135).</p>
<p>In spite of the ukkhepanīyakamma the 
Chabbaggiya monks kept company with Arittha, thereby committing a pācittaya-offence 
(Vin.iv.137). We find the Buddha rebuking the nun 
<a href="thulla_nandaa.htm" title="t/thulla_nandaa.htm">Thullanandā</a> for associating 
with Arittha after the ukkhepanīyakamma (Vin.iv.218).</p>
<p>It was Arittha’s heresy that led to the 
preaching of the <a href="alagadduupama_s.htm" title="am/alagadduupama_s.htm">Alagaddūpama Sutta</a> (M.i.130ff). </p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.v.314-15), Arittha is mentioned as having said to the Buddha that he 
practised concentration in breathing and as having described how he did it. The 
Buddha, thereupon, instructs him as to how such concentration can be done 
perfectly and in every detail.  </p>
<p>In the Samanatapāsādikā Arittha is mentioned in a 
list of enemies of the Sāsana. Sp.iv.874.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Arittha</b>.-An upāsaka mentioned in the 
Anguttara Nikāya (iii.451) in a list of householders and upāsakas who had seen 
and realised immortality and were possessed of unwavering faith in the Buddha, 
the Dhamma and the Sangha. They practised Ariyan conduct and had won wisdom and 
liberty.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Arittha</b>.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned 
in a list of Pacceka Buddhas. M.iii.69; APA.i.106; also Netti, 143.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Arittha</b>.-Nephew of Devānampiyatissa. 
See Mahā Arittha.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Arittha</b>.-Son of the Nāga king, 
Dhatarattha. See Kānārittha.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Arittha</b>.-A messenger of Vessavana, 
employed by him to take his proclamations and publish them. D.iii.201.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Arittha Sutta</b>.-Records a conversation — 
already referred to (s.v. Arittha 1) — between Arittha and the Buddha regarding 
concentration on breathing. The Buddha asks the monks whether they practise such 
concentration. Arittha says that he himself does and proceeds to explain his 
method. The Buddha, while not condemning it, explains to him how concentration 
could be made perfect in every detail. S.v.314-15.</p>
