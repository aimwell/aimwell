<p>The name of a tribe and a country, the capital of which 
was Sumsumāragiri (q.v.). </p>
<p>The Buddha went there several times in the course of his 
wanderings (e.g., A.ii.61, A.iv.85, etc.; Vin.ii.127; iv. 115, 198) and three 
rules for the monks were laid down there (Vin.v.145). </p>
<p>Bodhirājakumāra (q.v. 1), son of Udena of Kosambi, lived 
there, apparently as his father’s viceroy, in which case the Bhaggā were subject 
to Kosambī. The C.H.I. (i.175) says that the Bhaggā were members of the Vajjian 
confederacy. </p>
<p>The Bhagga country lay between Vesāli and Sāvatthi.</p>
<p>It was while sojourning in the Bhagga country that 
Moggallāna was attacked by Māra entering into his stomach (M.i.332), and it was 
there that he preached the Anumāna Sutta (M.i.95). Sirimanda and the parents of 
Nakula were inhabitants of the Bhagga country, and Sigālapitā (ThagA.i.70) went 
there in order to meditate; there he became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the Apadāna (Ap.ii.359) the Bhaggā are mentioned with 
the Kārusā.</p>
