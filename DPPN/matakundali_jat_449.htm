  <h2>Mattakundali Jātaka (No. 449)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The son of a wealthy brahmin died at the age of sixteen 
and was reborn among the devas. From the time of his son’s death, the brahmin 
would go to the cemetery and walk round the heap of ashes, moaning piteously. 
The deva visited him and admonished him, as in the story of Mattakundali. The 
brahmin followed his advice and gave up his grief. </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a rich landowner of 
Sāvatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha, who lost his son. The Buddha, knowing 
of his great grief, visited him in the company of Ānanda and preached to him. At 
the conclusion of the sermon, the landowner became a sotāpanna. J.iv.59ff.</p>
