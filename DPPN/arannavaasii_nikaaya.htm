</ul>
<p>A group of monks in Ceylon who seem to 
have spent most of their time in solitary spots engaged in meditation. They owed 
allegiance to the Mahāvihāra. They are first heard of in the sixth century when, 
in the reign of Aggabodhi II., the King of Kalinga came over to Ceylon and 
joined the Order under the famous Elder Jotipāla. This fraternity seems to have 
been closely associated with the Buddhists of Kālinga. Among famous scholars 
belonging to it were: Ānanda Vanaratanatissa, Vedeha, Cola Buddhappiya, Culla 
Dhammapāla, Medhankara, his pupil Ānanda and Siddhattha.</p>
<p>The Araññavāsins were specially esteemed 
by Parakkamabāhu of Dambadeniya. For details about them see P.L.C. 210-13, 226, 
229.</p>
