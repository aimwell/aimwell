<p>The name given in the Pāli chronicles to 
the city of Pagan in Burma (Rāmañña) (Bode: op. cit., 14). During the time of 
Parakkamabāhu I. of Ceylon, the King of Arimaddana quarrelled with him, 
ill-treated his envoys, and seized by force a princess sent from Ceylon to 
Kamboja. Parakkama sent a punitive expedition under the Damilādhikāri Ādicca, 
who reduced the country to subjection (Cv.lxxvi.10-75).</p>
<p>Later Vijayabāhu II. of Ceylon entered 
into friendly negotiations with the ruler of Arimaddana, and wrote him a letter 
in the Māgadha language composed by himself. As a result, a friendly treaty was 
made between them which also resulted in closer contact between the monks of the 
two countries (Cv.lxxx.6-8).</p>
<p>According to some authorities, quoted by 
Minayeff (Recherches sur Bouddhisme, p.70), the city was full of learned women. 
The Gandhavamsa (p.67) mentions a list of twenty-three teachers who wrote their 
works in Arimaddana. From this context it appears that Arimaddana was known also 
as Pukkāma (Pukkāmasankhāte Arimaddananagare). This is supported by evidence 
from elsewhere (Forchhammer: Jardine Prize Essay, pp.29, 32. Ind. Ant.1893, 
p.17). It was a minister in Arimaddana who wrote the Nyāsappadīpatīkā 
(Svd.v.1240). Arimaddana was also the city of birth of the Thera Chapata 
(Svd.v.1247).</p>
