<p>Some pupils of a Bhāradvāja brahmin; 
faggot-gatherers (katthahārakā), came across the Buddha engaged in meditation in 
a forest in Kosala and informed their teacher of it. He went to the Buddha and 
questioned him as to his purpose in dwelling in the forest. The brahmin 
expressed himself as being pleased with the information (S.i.180).</p>
