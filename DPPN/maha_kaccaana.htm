  <h2>Mahā Kaccāna, Kaccāyana</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, 
considered chief among expounders in full of the brief saying of the Buddha, (sankhittena 
bhāsitassa vitthārena attham vibhajantānam) (A.i.23). He was born at Ujjenī in 
the family of the chaplain of King Candappajjota, and was called Kaccāna both 
because of his golden colour and because Kaccāna was the name of his gotta. He 
studied the Vedas, and, on the death of his father, succeeded him as chaplain. 
With seven others he visited the Buddha, at the request of Candappajjota, to 
invite him to come to Ujjenī. Kaccāna and his friends listened to the Buddha’s 
sermon, and having attained arahantship, joined the order. He then conveyed the 
king’s invitation to the Buddha, who pointed out that it would now suffice if 
Kaccāna himself returned to Ujjenī.</p>
<p>Kaccāna accordingly set out for Ujjenī with his seven 
companions, accepting alms on the way at the house of a very poor girl of 
Telappanāli, who later became Candappajjota’s queen. For details see Telappanāli.</p>
<p>Arrived in Ujjenī, Kaccāna lived in the royal park, where 
the king showed him all honour. He preached constantly to the people, and, 
attracted by his discourses, numerous persons joined the Order, so that the 
whole city was one blaze of orange robes. It is said that after having duly 
established the sāsana in Avantī, Kaccāna returned once more to the Buddha. 
(Thus, the explanation of the Madhupindika Sutta was given at Kapilavatthu). 
Candappajjota consulted him on various occasions, and among the verses 
attributed to him in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.494 501), are several addressed to 
the king himself.</p>
<p>It was in the time of Padumuttara Buddha that Kaccāna had 
made his resolve to win the eminence he did, after listening to Padumuttara’s 
praise of a monk, also named Kaccāna, for similar proficiency. Kaccāna was then 
a vijjādhara, and offered the Buddha three kanikāra flowers. So says the Apadāna 
ii.463, but ThagA. says he was a vijjādhara in the 
time of Sumedhā Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a householder of 
Benares, and offered a golden brick, worth one hundred thousand, to the cetiya 
which was being built over the Buddha’s remains, and then made a vow that in 
future births his body should be golden (ThagA.i.483f.; AA.i.117f).</p>
<p>According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.465), Kaccāna’s father was 
called Tirītivaccha (or Tidivavaccha), and his mother Candapadumā. There is 
another account of Mahā Kaccāna in the Apadāna (A.i.84f), in which it is said 
that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he built a yandhakuti named Paduma in the 
shape of a lotus and covered with lotus flowers, and that thirty kappas later he 
became king under the name of Pabhassara.</p>
<p>Three suttas are mentioned (AA.i.118) as having obtained 
for Kaccāna his title of eminence — 
the Madhupindika, the Kaccāyana and the Parāyana; several instances are given of 
people seeking Mahā Kaccāna’s assistance, for a detailed explanation of 
something said in brief by the Buddha — e.g., Hāliddikāni, Kālī, Samiddhi, 
Uttara and Valliya (see also A.iii.314, 321; v. 225; M.iii.223). Among Kaccāna’s 
pupils and followers and those who consulted him were Sonakutikanna, Isidatta, 
Avantiputta, Lohicca, Arāmadanda, and Kandarāyana.</p>
<p>In Avanti, Kaccāna is said to have stayed, not in the 
king’s park, where he lived soon after his return from the Buddha, but chiefly 
in the Kuraraghara papātā (E.g., S.iii.9; A.v.46; Ud.v.6; Vin.i.194; DhA.iv.101) 
and in a hut in Makkarakata forest. S.iv.116; see also VvA.259, according to 
which he stayed near Potali. </p>
<p>Mention is also made of his staying at Varanā on the bank 
of Kaddamadaha (A.i.65); at the Gundāvana in Madhurā (A.i.67; M.ii.83); at 
Tapodā in Rājagaha (A.iii.192), in Soreyya (DhA.i.325; for a curious incident 
connected with Kaccāna’s visit see Soreyya), and in Kosambī (PvA. 140). 
According to Dvy. (551, 585, 586) he also stayed in Roruka. </p>
<p>It is said (DhA.ii.176) that even when Kaccāna was living 
at Avanti, a long distance away, he went regularly to hear the Buddha preach, 
and when the chief theras took their places in the assembly, they always left 
room for him. On one such occasion Sakka showed him great honour, falling at his 
feet, and the Buddha explained that this was because Mahā Kaccāna kept his 
senses well guarded.</p>
<p>The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.854) records a curious 
story in reference to Kaccāna. Vassakāra, minister of Ajātasattu, saw Kaccāna 
descending Gijjhakūta and said he looked like a monkey. The Buddha read 
Vassakāra’s thoughts, and warned him that after death he would be born as a 
monkey in Veluvana. He believed the Buddha, and made provision in Veluvana for 
his future comfort as monkey. And this be did indeed become, living in Veluvana 
and answering to the name of Vassakāra!</p>
<p>Kaccāna is identified with the charioteer in the 
Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.181), and with Devala in the Sarabhanga Jātaka 
(J.v.151).</p>
<p>According to tradition, Kaccāna was the author of the 
Nettippakarana, the Pāli grammar bearing his name, and of the Petakopadesa. It 
is probable that these works were the compilations of a school, which traced its 
descent to Mahā Kaccāna.</p>
