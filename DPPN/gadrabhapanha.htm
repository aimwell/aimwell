<p>One of the problems set by King Vedeha 
to Mahosadha, in order to test him, at the instigation of the king’s ministers. 
The king sent word to Mahosadha that while he was on his way to see him his 
horse had broken its leg; would Mahosadha therefore, send him a more excellent 
horse? Mahosadha, understanding the significance of the message, went to the 
palace, sending his father on before him. When Mahosadha entered he found his 
father seated, but, as had been prearranged, he obliged his father to get up and 
offer him his seat. On this there was a great uproar, all saying that he had 
slighted his father. But Mahosadha convinced the king that he was a more 
excellent man than his father, giving proof of this by producing before the king 
an ass which he had brought with him, and making the king acknowledge that a 
colt born of the ass through a Sindh mare would be far more valuable than the 
colt’s sire (J.vi.342f).</p>
<p>The story is also given as a separate 
Jātaka (No.111). J.i.424.</p>
