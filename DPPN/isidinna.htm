<p>A thera. He was the son of a setthi in 
Sunāparanta. He witnessed the miracle of the Buddha’s acceptance of the 
Candana-mālā (probably the Candanamālaka), and, having heard the Buddha preach, 
he became a Sotāpanna. While still living the life of a householder, a 
compassionate spirit urged him to give it up. He entered the Order and soon 
after became an arahant (ThagA.i.312-3). </p>
<p>The Theragāthās (vv.187-8) contains two 
verses which he uttered in confessing aññā. They were the same as were spoken to 
him by his friendly spirit. In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder 
and did homage to the Buddha’s Bodhi-tree with a fan made of sumana-flowers 
(ThagA.312f). He is probably identical with Sumanavājaniya of the Apadāna 
(Ap.ii.415).</p>
