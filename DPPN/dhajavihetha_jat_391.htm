<p>A wizard was wont to come at midnight in 
order to corrupt the queen of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. She complained to the king and, at his 
request, she set the mark on her hand with vermillion on his back. By day the 
man was an ascetic, and when he found that he was discovered he fled through the 
air. The king thereupon suspected all ascetics and ordered them all to leave the 
kingdom. The king became a heretic. The Bodhisatta who was born as Sakka, seeing 
all this, came to Benares with an old Pacceka Buddha and stood close to the 
palace, showing him great reverence. When the king came out Sakka revealed his 
identity, telling him that even the ruler of the gods honoured pious men. The 
king saw his error and mended his ways.</p>
<p>The origin of the story is given in the 
Mahākanha Jātaka. The king is identified with Ānanda. J.iii.303-7. More or less 
the same story is given at greater length and with several variations in detail 
in both the Cullahamsa and the Mahāhamsa Jātakas.</p>
