<p>A <a href="gandhabbaa.htm" title="g/gandhabbaa.htm">Gandhabba</a> maiden, daughter of 
<a href="timbaru.htm" title="t/timbaru.htm">Timbaru</a>.  </p>
<p>When she went to 
dance before <a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, 
<a href="pancasikha.htm" title="pa/pancasikha.htm">Pañcasikha</a> saw her and fell in love with her, but she 
favoured Mātali’s son Sikhandi.  </p>
<p>Later she heard Pañcasikha sing love-songs in 
her honour, which also contained references to his deep attachment to the 
Buddha. This influenced her choice, and she became his wife (D.ii.258, 268f).</p>
<p>Her personal name was Bhaddā. She was called Suriyavaccasā 
because of her bodily beauty (sarīrasampattiyā). DA.iii.704.</p>
