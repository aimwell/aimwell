  <h2>Dhammadāyāda Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha exhorts the monks at Jetavana 
to strive earnestly to be heirs, not of the world’s goods, but of the Doctrine. 
On the Buddha’s departure the monks gather round Sāriputta and ask him how the 
Buddha expects them to cultivate the inner life with the same aloofness as does 
the Buddha himself, and Sāriputta delivers a discourse (M.i.12ff). </p>
<p>This sutta is often referred to (E.g., 
Mil.242; Sp.iii.694) as teaching the virtues of contentment.</p>
