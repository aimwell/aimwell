<p><b>1. Bhāvanā Sutta</b>. A monk may wish to be free from the āsavas and from 
attachment, but his wish will be fruitless unless he develops the four 
satipatthānas, the four sammappadhānas, the four iddhi-pādas, 
the five indriyas, the five powers, the seven bojjhangas, and the Eightfold 
Noble Path. Without these he resembles one who waits for eggs to hatch out when 
there is no hen. But if the monk develops these qualities he will wear away the 
āsavas, etc., and be aware that they are worn away, like a carpenter who knows 
when the handle of his adze is worn away; all these things will weaken and rot 
away like a ship out of the water all the winter, exposed to wind and rain. 
A.iv.125f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhāvanā Sutta</b>. The four satipatthānas, if 
  cultivated, conduce to the state in which no further and no hither shore 
  exist. S.v.180.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhāvanā Sutta</b>. The cultivation of the four 
  satipatthānas consists in contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and mind 
  states. S.v.182.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhāvanā Sutta</b>. On psychic (iddhi ) power, its 
  basis, its cultivation, amid the practice which leads to its cultivation. 
  S.v.276.</p>
