</ul>
<p>A merchant of Benares, the Bodhisatta. 
 
</p>
<p>He was a potter and owned a donkey who carried loads of pots and could travel 
seven leagues a day. Once Kappata took the donkey to Takkasilā, where the latter 
became so enamoured of a female donkey that he refused to go home until the 
merchant promised to find him a mate equally beautiful. On reaching home the 
merchant offered to fulfil his promise, but refused to supply any extra food for 
the animal’s mate or for the foals if any were born. This opened the donkey’s 
eyes, and he renounced his desire for a mate. The donkey is identified with
<a href="nanda.htm" title="n/nanda.htm">Nanda</a>, and the female donkey with 
<a href="janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm" title="j/janapadakalyaanii_nandaa.htm">Janapadakalyānī Nandā</a> (DhA.i.103f).</p>
