<h4>1. Punnamāsa Thera</h4>
<p>He was born in Sāvatthi as the son of a brahmin, named 
Samiddhi; he was called Punnamāsa because, on the day of his birth, all the 
empty vessels in the house were filled with golden pennies. He left the world 
after a son had been born to him, and, having entered the Order under the 
Buddha, took the formula of the five impurities (tacapañcaka) as topic of 
meditation and became an arahant. His former wife adorned herself and came with 
her child, seeking to seduce him, but without success.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a partridge (cakkavāka), 
and, pleased with the appearance of the Buddha, offered him a sāla flower, 
holding it in his beak. Seventeen kappas ago he became king eight times under 
the name of Sucārudassana (Thag. vs. 10; ThagA.i.53f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Paccāgamanīya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.113.</p>

<h4>2. Punnamāsa Thera</h4>
<p>He was born at Sāvatthi in a landowner’s family. He was 
named Punnamāsa because, on the day of his birth, all the empty vessels in the 
house became filled with gold and silver coins. He left the world after the 
birth of a son, and, dwelling near the village, put forth effort, till he became 
an arahant. Then going to Sāvatthi, he paid homage to the Buddha and dwelt in a 
charnel field. Meanwhile his son died, and his wife, wishing to prevent the king 
from taking the property, which was now left without an heir, went, with a large 
company, to her husband in order to persuade him to return to the lay life.</p>
<p>In the time of Tissa Buddha he was wandering about the 
forest, bow in hand, when he saw the Buddha’s robe hanging on a branch outside 
his cell. He immediately threw away his bow and, recalling the Buddha’s virtues, 
paid homage to the robe. Thag.vs.171, 172; ThagA.i.297f. </p>
<p>He is probably identical with Pamsukūlasaññika of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.418f.</p>
