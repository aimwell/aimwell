<p>Tenth son of <a href="devagabbhaa.htm" title="d/devagabbhaa.htm">DevagabbhÄ</a> and 
<a href="upasaagara.htm" title="u/upasaagara.htm">UpasÄgara</a> 
(J.iv.81f), and one of the <a href="andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm" title="ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm">AndhakavenhudÄsaputtÄ</a>. </p>
<p>Ankura gave his share of the kingdom, 
won by the dÄsaputtÄ, to his sister <a href="anjanadevi.htm" title="ay/anjanadevi.htm">AÃ±janÄ</a>, and started in trade (J.iv.81f). The 
<a href="peta_vatthu.htm" title="pu/peta_vatthu.htm">Peta Vatthu</a> (Pv.23ff.; PvA.111ff) contains an account of Ankuraâ€™s later career. 
Once he took a caravan of a thousand carts from <a href="dvaaravatii.htm" title="d/dvaaravatii.htm">DvÄravatÄ«</a> to 
<a href="kamboja.htm" title="ka/kamboja.htm">Kamboja</a>, led by 
himself and a brahmin colleague. On the way their water supply fails, but they 
are befriended by a Yakkha of great power, who, in his previous life, had been 
one of Ankuraâ€™s trusted and loyal servants. Annoyed by the suggestion of the 
brahmin that instead of proceeding to Kamboja they should entice the Yakkha back 
with them to DvÄravatÄ«, the Yakkha appears before them in person, and in answer 
to Ankuraâ€™s questions, tells him that he had been a tailor in Bheruva, where 
lived the generous Asayha. When suppliants came in search of Asayhaâ€™s house, the 
tailor showed them the way. Impressed by the story, Ankura returns forthwith to 
DvÄravatÄ«, and spends the rest of his life, 60,000 years (10,000 says DhA.(loc 
infra);Sp.i.245), in acts of unparalleled munificence. (There were as many as 
3,000 cooks to supply food in his alms-halls and 60,000 youths to cut firewood.) 
He is reborn in <a href="taavatimsa.htm" title="t/taavatimsa.htm">TÄvatimsa</a>. </p>
<p>In the assembly of the devas who gather 
to listen to the Buddhaâ€™s preaching of the Abhidhamma, Ankura occupies a place 
in the back row, (12 leagues away says DhA.iii.219; 10 leagues away says Pv.28, 
v.65) while Indaka, who had given but one spoonful of rice to Anuruddha Thera, 
sits quite close to the Buddha. The Buddha notices this and remarks that Indaka 
had been lucky in finding a worthy donee; the recipients of Ankuraâ€™s gifts had 
not been distinguished for their holiness. Gifts should, therefore, be given 
discriminately. At the end of this discourse Ankura becomes a sotÄpanna.
