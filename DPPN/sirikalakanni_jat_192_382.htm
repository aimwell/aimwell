<p><b>1. Sirikālakanni Jātaka (No.192).</b>&nbsp; Another 
name for the Sirikāla-kannipañha (q.v.).</p>

<p><b>2. Sirikālakanni Jātaka (No.382). </b>The Bodhisatta 
was once a merchant of Benares, and, because his household observed the rules of 
piety, he came to be called Suciparivāra (“pure household”). He kept an unused 
couch and bed for anyone who might come to his house and was purer than himself. 
One day Kālakannī, daughter of Virūpakka and Sirī, Dhatarattha’s daughter, went 
to bathe in Anotatta, and a quarrel arose as to which should bathe first. As 
neither the Four Regent Gods nor Sakka were willing to decide, they referred the 
two goddesses to Suciparivāra. Kālakannī first appeared before him in blue 
raiment and jewels, and, on being asked what were her qualities, she told him, 
and was asked to vanish from his sight. Then came Sirī, diffusing yellow 
radiance, and the Bodhisatta, discovering her identity and her virtues, welcomed 
her and offered her his unused couch. Thus was the dispute settled. The bed used 
by Sirī came to be called Sirisaya, hence the origin of Sirisayana.</p>
<p>Sirī is identified with Uppalavannā. J.iii. 257-64.</p>
