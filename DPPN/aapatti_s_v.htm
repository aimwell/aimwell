<h2>Āpatti (Sutta/Vagga)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Āpatti.-A section of the Vinaya Pitaka, 
the fourth chapter of the Parivāra. Vin.v.91ff.</p>
<p>Āpatti Vagga.-The twenty-fifth chapter 
of the Catukka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya, containing ten suttas on various 
subjects. A.ii.239-46.</p>
<p>1. Āpatti Sutta.-Ānanda informs the 
Buddha at Ghositārāma in Kosambī, that Bāhiya’s efforts to bring about 
dissension in the Order had not been suppressed because Anuruddha, being 
Bāhiya’s colleague, did not want to interfere. The Buddha tells him that they 
should not depend on Anuruddha for interference in disputes, for he was by 
temperament unfitted for such action. He then proceeds to discourse to Ānanda on 
the four probable reasons for a monk being desirous of creating dissension 
(A.ii.239f).</p>
<p>2. Āpatti Sutta.-Deals with the four 
kinds of fears produced by transgressions, involving either being taken in the 
act and punished or having to confess guilt and receive punishment. A.ii.240-3.</p>
