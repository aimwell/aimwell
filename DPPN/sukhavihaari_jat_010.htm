<p>The Bodhisatta was once an Udicca-brahmin and later became 
a leader of ascetics. When the ascetics came to Benares for the rainy season, 
the king invited their leader to stay behind while the others returned at the 
end of the rains. One day the Bodhisatta’s chief disciple visited him and sat 
down on a mat by his side, exclaiming: “Oh happiness, what happiness!” The king 
came to pay his respects to the teacher, but was displeased because the disciple 
still sat there. The Bodhisatta explained that the disciple had also been a king 
who had renounced his kingship for the ascetic life.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Bhaddiya who, after 
he had won arahantship, kept on saying “aho sukham, aho sukham,” because he 
realized how full of fear he had been as a layman and how free from fear he was 
as an arahant. Bhaddiya is identified with the chief disciple of the Bodhisatta. 
J.i.140-2.</p>
