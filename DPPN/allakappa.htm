<p><b>1. Allakappa.</b>-A country near Magadha. 
When the Bulis of Allakappa heard of the Buddha’s death, they sent messengers to 
the Mallas asking for a portion of the relics, claiming that they too, like the 
Buddha, were khattiyas. Having obtained them, they later built a thūpa over them 
(D.ii.166-7; Bv.xxviii.2).  </p>
<p>Allakappa seems to have had a republican form of 
government, but its importance was not very great. According to the Dhammapada 
Commentary (DhA.i.161), Allakappa was ten leagues in extent and its king was on 
intimate terms of friendship with the King of <a href="vethadiipa.htm" title="vy/vethadiipa.htm">Vethadīpaka</a>. They spent a great 
deal of their time together, so that the two countries must have been near each 
other.</p>

<p><b>2. Allakappa.</b>-The King of Allakappa and 
friend of King <a href="vethadiipa.htm" title="vy/vethadiipa.htm">Vethadīpaka</a>. They both renounced their kingdoms and became 
ascetics in the Himālaya. At first they lived in the same hermitage, but later 
separated and lived apart, meeting once a fortnight, on fast-days.</p>
<p>Vethadīpaka died and was born a mighty 
king of devas. Soon after, when visiting Allakappa, he learned that the latter’s 
asceticism was being disturbed by wild elephants. Vethadīpaka gave him a lute 
with which to charm them, and spells whereby he might influence them. The lute 
had three strings; at the plucking of the first, the elephants ran away at once, 
of the second they ran away but looked back at each step, but when the third was 
plucked, the leader of the herd came and offered the player his back on which to 
sit.</p>
<p>Some time later, Allakappa met the Queen 
of Parantapa, King of Kosambi, with her son Udena, who had been born in the 
forest, the queen having been carried thither by a large bird of prey. Allakappa 
took them to the hermitage and looked after them, in ignorance of their high 
estate. He later lived with the queen as his wife. One day he perceived, by the 
occultation of Parantapa’s star, that the king was dead; he told this to the 
queen who then confessed her identity and that of Udena, the legitimate heir to 
the throne. Allakappa gave to Udena the magic lute and taught him the spells 
that by their power he might gain his heritage. See <a href="udena.htm" title="u/udena.htm">Udena</a>.</p>
