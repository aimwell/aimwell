<p>Once, Brahmadatta, king of Benares, discovered one of his 
courtiers intriguing in his harem. But being fond both of the man and the woman 
concerned, he asked advice of his counselor, the Bodhisatta, in a riddle&nbsp;&nbsp; 
that a pretty lake at the foot of a hill was being used by a jackal, while the 
lion lay quiet through it all. The counsellor’s answer was that all creatures 
drink at will of a mighty river, yet the river is a river for all that. The king 
understood the answer and advised both those concerned.</p>
<p>The story was related to the king of Koala who had 
detected a similar happening in his court. J.ii.125ff.</p>
