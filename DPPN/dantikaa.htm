<p>An arahant Theri. She was daughter of 
the King of Kosala’s chaplain and was born in Sāvatthi. She joined the Order 
under Pajāpatī Gotamī. One day, during her siesta on Gijjhakūta, she saw how a 
well tamed elephant obeyed its master’s commands, and developing insight on this 
theme, she became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the past she had been a kinnarī on 
the banks of the Candabhāgā, and having seen a Pacceka Buddha at the foot of a 
tree, she honoured him by offering flowers. Thig.48-50; ThigA.51f.</p>
