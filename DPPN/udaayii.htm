<p><b>1. Udāyī Thera.</b>-Also called Lāludāyī 
(and Pandita Udāyī), to distinguish him from others. — He was the son of a 
brahmin of Kapilavatthu. He saw the power and majesty of the Buddha when the 
latter visited his kinsmen and, entering the Order, in due course became an 
arahant. When the Buddha preached the Nāgopama Sutta (see A.iii.344f), on the 
occasion when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, was publicly admired, Udāyī was 
stirred to enthusiasm by thoughts of the Buddha and uttered sixteen verses, 
extolling the virtues of the Buddha, comparing him to a great and wondrous 
elephant. (Thag.vv.689-704; ThagA.ii.7f.; Udāyī’s verses are repeated in the 
Anguttara (iii.346-7) but the Commentary (ii.669) attributes them to Kāludāyī).
</p>
<p>Once when Udāyī was staying at Kāmandā, 
in Todeyya’s mango-grove, he converted a pupil of a brahmin of the Verahaccāni 
clan and, as a result, was invited by Verahaccāni herself to her house. It was 
only on his third visit to Verahaccāni that Udāyī preached to her and she 
thereupon became a follower of the Faith (S.iv.121-4).  </p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya 
(iv.166f.; another discussion with Ānanda is mentioned in A.iv.426f) also 
records a conversation between Udāyī and Ānanda, when Udāyī asks if it is 
possible to describe the consciousness, too, as being without the self. On 
another occasion Udāyī has a discussion with Pañcakanga on vedanā (M.i.396ff; 
S.iv.223-4; the Commentary SA.iii.86 and MA.ii.629 here describes Udāyī as “Pandita”). 
Ānanda overhears their conversation and reports it to the Buddha, who says that 
Udāyī’s explanation is true, though not accepted by Pañcakanga.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere 
(S.v.86ff) Udāyī is mentioned as asking the Buddha to instruct him on the 
bojjhangas, and once, at Desaka (Setaka?) in the Sumbha country, he tells the 
Buddha how he cultivated the bojjhangas and thereby attained to final 
emancipation (S.v.89).</p>
<p>He is rebuked by the Buddha for his 
sarcastic remark to Ānanda, that Ānanda had failed to benefit by his close 
association with the Master. The Buddha assures him that Ānanda will, in that 
very life, become an arahant (A.i.228).</p>
<p>Udāyī was evidently a clever and 
attractive preacher, for he is mentioned as having addressed large crowds, a 
task demanding great powers, as the Buddha himself says when this news of Udāyī 
is reported to him (A.iii.184).  </p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.903), it is 
this same Udāyī (Mahā Udāyī) who, having listened to the Sampasādaniya Sutta, is 
beside himself with joy at the contemplation of the wonderful qualities as set 
forth in that Sutta, and marvels that the Buddha does not go about proclaiming 
them. Buddhaghosa (MA.i.526) seems to identify him also with the Udāyī to whom 
the Latukikopama Sutta (M.i.447ff) was preached.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Udāyī.</b>-A thera. It was once his turn 
to recite the Pātimokkha before the Sangha, but because he had a crow’s voice (kākasaraka), 
he had to obtain permission to make a special effort so that his recitation 
might be audible to the others (Vin.i.115). It is, perhaps, this same monk who 
is mentioned in the Vinaya as having been guilty of numerous Sanghādisesa 
offences (Vin.iii.110f, 119f, 127f, 137f, 135ff).  </p>
<p>He is censured again and again 
and various penalties are inflicted on him, nevertheless he repeats his offences 
(Vin.ii.38ff). In the Nissagyiya (Vin.iii.205f) a story is told of a nun, a 
former mistress of Udāyī, who conceived a child through touching a garment worn 
by him. Once when Uppalavannā asked him to take some meat to the Buddha, he 
demanded her inner robe as his fees (Vin.iii.208). He seems to have been very 
fond of the company of women and they returned his liking. (See, e.g., 
Vin.iv.20, 61, 68). There was evidently a strain of cruelty in him, for we are 
told of his shooting crows and spitting them with their heads cut off 
(Vin.iv.124). He is described as being fat (Vin.iv.171). He is perhaps to be 
identified with <a href="laludayi_th.htm" title="l/laludayi_th.htm">Lāludāyī</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Udāyī.</b>-A brahmin. He visited the 
Buddha at Sāvatthi and asked if the Buddha ever praised sacrifice. The Buddha’s 
answer was that he did not commend sacrifices which involved butchery, but 
praised those which were innocent of any killing (A.ii.43f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Udāyī</b>.-See also under Kāludāyī, 
<a href="laludayi_th.htm" title="l/laludayi_th.htm">Lāludāyī</a> and Sakuludāyī. As they are all, from time to time, referred to as 
Udāyī it is not always possible to ascertain which is meant. The Commentary is 
not an infallible guide.</p>
