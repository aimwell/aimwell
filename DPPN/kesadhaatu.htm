  <h2>Kesadhātu</h2>

<p>A very high rank bestowed by the 
Sinhalese kings. It appears to have corresponded to the modern Orders. It may 
have originated in the members of the Order being entrusted with the care of the 
Hair Relic (Kesadhātu), which was brought to Ceylon in the reign of Moggallāna I 
(Cv.xxxix.49). This duty afterwards evidently became a mere formality. The word 
Kesadhātu may be an abbreviation of the fuller Kesadhātunāyaka.</p>
<p>We first come across the term in the 
time of Vijayabāhu I., when a Kesadhātu, Kassapa by name, became governor of 
Rohana (Cv.lvii.65f). Parakkamabāhu I. conferred the title on his general, the 
Dandādhināyaka Rakkha. Cv.lxx.19.</p>
