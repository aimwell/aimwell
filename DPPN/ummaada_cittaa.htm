<p>Mother of Pandukābhaya, king of Ceylon. 
She was the daughter of Bhaddakaccānā and Panduvāsudeva, and when she was born 
the brahmins foretold that her son would kill all his uncles. Her brothers, 
therefore, resolved to kill her, but she was saved by her eldest brother Abhaya. 
She was put in a chamber built on a single pillar, with an entrance through the 
king’s bedroom. But Dīghagāmanī fell in love with her and visited her at night 
with the help of a hook-ladder. Later, when with child, she was given to him in 
marriage (Mhv.ix.1ff; Dpv.x.4).</p>
<p>She was given the name of Ummāda-Cittā 
because the mere sight of her beauty drove men mad. Mhv.ix.5.</p>
