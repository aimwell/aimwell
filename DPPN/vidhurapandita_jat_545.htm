  <h2>Vidhurapandita Jātaka (No. 545)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>v.l. Vidhūrapandita.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Four kings&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Dhanañjaya Korabba, king of Indapatta; </li>
  <li>Sakka, </li>
  <li>the Nāga king Varuna, and </li>
  <li>Venateyya king of the Supannas&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>having taken the uposatha-vows, meet together in a garden 
and there have a dispute as to which of them is the most virtuous. They cannot 
decide among themselves and agree, therefore, to refer the matter to 
Dhanañjaya’s minister, Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta). The minister listens to 
the claims of each and then declares that all are equal; their virtues are like 
the spokes of a wheel. They are pleased, and Sakka gives the minister a silk 
robe, Varuna a jewel, the Supanna king a golden garland, and Dhanañjaya one 
thousand cows.</p>
<p>Vimalā, Varuna’s wife, hearing from her husband of 
Vidhura’s wisdom, is so enchanted that she yearns to see him, and in order to do 
so feigns illness, and says that she must have Vidhura’s heart. Varuna’s 
daughter, Irandatī, is offered to anyone who can get possession of Vidhura’s 
heart, and the Yakkha Punnaka, nephew of Vessavana, who sees her and is 
fascinated by her beauty, accepts the condition. He obtains Vessavana’s consent 
by a ruse and visits Dhanañjaya’s court. There he challenges the king to a game 
of dice, giving his name as Kaccāyana, and offers as stake his wonderful steed 
and all seeing gem, provided the king will offer Vidhura as his. Dhanañaya 
agrees, plays and loses. Vidhura agrees to go with Punnaka; the king asks him 
questions regarding the householder’s life for his own guidance, and Vidhura is 
given three days' leave to visit his family. Having taken leave of them, he goes 
with Punnaka. On the way Punnaka tries in vain to kill him by frightening him. 
When Vidhura discovers Punnaka’s intention, he preaches to him as he sits on the 
top of the Kālapabbata, and the Yakkha is so moved that he offers to take 
Vidhura back to Indapatta. But in spite of his protestations, Vidhura insists on 
going on to the Nāga world. They arrive in Varuna’s abode; Vidhura preaches 
first to Varuna and then to Vimalā. They are both delighted, and Punnaka wins 
the hand of Irandatī. In his great joy Punnaka gives Vidhura his marvellous 
jewel and takes him back to Indapatta. There Vidhura relates his adventures and 
gives the jewel to the king. A festival lasting one month is held in honour of 
Vidhura’s return.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s wisdom. 
Vidhura’s chief wife, Anujjā, is identified with Rāhulamātā; his eldest son, 
Dhammapāla, with Rāhula; Varuna with Sāriputta; the Supanna king with 
Moggallāna; Sakka with Anuruddha, and Dhanañjaya with Ānanda (J.vi.255-329).</p>
<p>The Jātaka is also referred to as the Punnaka Jātaka 
(E.g., J.iv.14, 182). Four scenes from the Jātaka are found on the Bharhut Tope.
