<p><b>1. Gijjha Jātaka (No.164).</b>-Once the 
Bodhisatta was born among the vultures on Gijjhakūtapabbata. On one occasion 
there was a great storm of wind and rain, and the vultures were forced to seek 
shelter in a ditch outside <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. A merchant, seeing them, provided them with 
a warm fire and food. When the weather cleared the vultures returned to their 
haunts, and decided to give the merchant whatever finery and jewellery they 
might find in their wanderings. These they dropped in the merchant’s garden. The 
king, hearing of their depredations, set traps and caught a vulture, who 
confessed the truth, which was corroborated by the merchant. The vulture was set 
free and the goods were returned to their owners.</p>
<p>Ānanda was the king, and Sāriputta the 
merchant.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who was charged with having supported his poor parents. The Buddha praised 
the man’s action, saying that such gratitude was an excellent quality. 
J.ii.50f.; see also the Sāma Jātaka.</p>

<p><b>2. Gijjha Jātaka (No.399).</b>-Once the 
Bodhisatta was a vulture, and supported his blind parents who lived in a cave. 
One day, being caught in a trap, he was heard by a hunter lamenting for his 
parents; the hunter set him free.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who supported his mother. Channa was the hunter. J.iii.330f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Gijjha Jātaka (No.427).</b>-Once the 
Bodhisatta was a vulture in Gijjhapabbata. His son, Supatta, was king of the 
vultures; he was very strong and supported his parents. One day, against the 
advice of his father, he flew in the upper air and was dashed to death by the 
Veramba-wind.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
disobedient monk of good family, who objected to being instructed in his duties 
(J.iii.483f.; cf. the Migalopa Jātaka; see also the Dubbaca and the 
Indasamāna-gotta Jātakas).</p>
<p>The Catudvāra Jātaka (J.iv.1ff) was 
related in reference to the same monk.</p>
