<p><b>11. Sudatta Thera</b> (v.l. <a name="Sudanta">Sudanta</a>).  </p>
<p>He belonged to a 
rich family of Velukantaka. Some give his name as Vāsula. He was a close friend 
of Kumāputta, and, on hearing that the latter had left the world, he, too, 
visited the Buddha with a similar end in view. The Buddha preached to him, and 
he entered the Order and lived on a hill with Kumāputta, engaged in meditation. 
But they were disturbed by the comings and goings of numerous monks, and, owing 
to the disturbance, spurred on to greater endeavour, Sudatta put forth effort 
and became an arahant. </p>
<p>Ninety four kappas ago, in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, 
he was a householder, and going into the forest, he made walking sticks, which 
he gave to the monks (Thag.vs.37; ThagA.i.101f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Dandadāyaka of the Apadāna, 
and is generally known as Kumāputtasahāya Thera. Ap.i.283.</p>
