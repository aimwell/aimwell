<p>A district, probably Northern Kanara, in South India. 
After the Third Council, <a href="rakkhita.htm" title="r/rakkhita.htm">Rakkhita</a> Thera was sent there to convert the people, 
and he preached the <a href="anamatagga_sam.htm" title="ay/anamatagga_sam.htm">Anamatagga Samyutta</a> poised in mid air. It is said that sixty 
thousand persons embraced the faith, thirty seven thousand joined the Order, 
while fifty vihāras were established in the country.</p>
<p>Mhv.xii.4, 30f.; Sp.i.63 66; Dpv.viii.6. The Vanavāsī are 
mentioned in the Mahābhārata (6. 366) and the Harivamsa (5232) as a people of S. 
India. The Sās (p.12) also mentions a county called Vanavāsī, which, however, is 
the country round Prome in Lower Burma.</p>
