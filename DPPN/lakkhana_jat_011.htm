  <h2>Lakkhana Jātaka (No. 11)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a deer and had two sons, Lakkhana 
and Kāla. When the time came for gathering the crops, he told his sons to seek 
refuge in the mountain tracts with their herds. They agreed, but Kāla, being 
ignorant, kept his deer on the tramp early and late, and men, coming upon them, 
destroyed most of them. Lakkhana, however, moved his deer only in the dead of 
night and reached the forest without losing any of his herd. The same thing 
happened on their return four months later, and the Boddhisatta praised 
Lakkhana’s intelligence.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to Devadatta and 
Sāriputta. Devadatta had persuaded five hundred monks to secede from the Buddha 
and go with him, but Sāriputta visited them and brought them all back.</p>
<p>Devadatta is identified with Kāla and Sāriputta with 
Lakkhana. J.i.142f.; the story is referred to at DhA.i.122.</p>
