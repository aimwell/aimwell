<p><b>1. Sāriputta Sutta.</b> The sixteenth sutta of the 
Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. Sāriputta asks the Buddha how a monk should 
conduct himself in order to achieve his goal. The Buddha explains that a monk 
must avoid the five dangers, endure heat and cold and other discomforts, and 
must not be guilty of theft, anger, lying or arrogance. He should be guided by 
wisdom and moderation (SN. 955 75). The Commentary explains (SNA.ii.569f ) that 
the sutta is also called the Therapañha Sutta, and that it was preached on the 
occasion of the Buddha’s descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa. The Buddha desired 
that Sāriputta’s wisdom should be adequately recognized, for Moggallāna’s iddhi, 
Anuruddha’s clairvoyance and Punna’s eloquence were already famous, but 
Sāriputta’s skill remained unknown. The Buddha therefore related the Parosahassa 
Jātaka in order to show Sāriputta’s wisdom in a past life. At the end of the 
story, Sāriputta questioned the Buddha in eight stanzas, and the rest of the 
sutta was spoken by the Buddha in answer to these questions.</p>

<p><b>2. Sāriputta Sutta.</b> The Buddha instructs Sāriputta 
on how to train oneself in order to get rid of notions of “I” and “mine.” The 
sutta contains a quotation from the Udayapañha. A.i.133.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sāriputta Sutta.</b> Sāriputta relates to Ānanda how 
once, when he was in Andhavana, he attained to perfect concentration. A.v.8.</p>
