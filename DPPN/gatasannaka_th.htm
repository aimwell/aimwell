<p>1. Gatasaññaka Thera.-An arahant. In the 
time of Tissa Buddha he joined the Order at the age of seven, and threw up into 
the air seven nangaliki-flowers as offering to the Buddha. Eight kappas ago he 
became king, three times, under the name of Aggisikha. Ap.i.127.</p>
<p>2. Gatasaññaka Thera.-An arahant. He saw 
the Buddha Siddhattha going through the air, though only his robe was visible to 
him. The sight filled him with joy and he concentrated his mind thereon. 
Ap.i.253f.</p>
