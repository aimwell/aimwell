<p>The, Bodhisatta was once a bird, leader of a large flock. 
He lived in a tree, and noticing one day that two of the boughs were grinding 
one against the other and producing smoke, he warned his flock of the risk of 
fire and left for elsewhere. The wiser birds followed him, but some remained 
behind and were burnt to death.</p>
<p>The story was related to a monk whose cell was burnt down. 
He told the villagers of this, and they continually promised to build him a new 
one, but failed to do so. As a result the monk lived in discomfort and his 
meditations were fruitless. When he reported this, the Buddha blamed him for not 
going elsewhere. J.i.215f.</p>
