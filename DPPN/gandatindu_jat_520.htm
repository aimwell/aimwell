<p>Pañcāla, king of Kampilla, is a wicked 
monarch, and his subjects, harassed by his officers, suffer great oppression. 
The Bodhisatta, born as the divinity of a gandatindu-tree, becoming aware of 
this, appears in the king’s bedchamber and urges him to give up his evil ways 
and find out for himself the condition of his subjects. The king, taking this 
advice, travels about in disguise with his chaplain. Everywhere he finds men, 
women and even the beasts cursing his very name. He returns to the capital and 
devotes himself to good works (J.v.98ff).</p>
<p>The introductory story is given in the 
Rājovāda Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
