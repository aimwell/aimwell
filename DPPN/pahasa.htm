</ul>
<p>A niraya in which stage players are born after death. Tālaputa 
maintained that after death they were born among the Pahāsadevi. The Buddha 
contradicts this and says that their rebirth is in a Niraya and not in any deva 
world (S.iv.305f.; ThagA.ii.156). Buddhaghosa explains (SA.iii.100) that Pahāsa 
is not a special Niraya but rather a section of Avīci, where beings suffer while 
wearing the form of singers or dancers.</p>
