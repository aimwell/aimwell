<p>Wife of Vessantara whose first cousin she was, being the 
daughter of the Madda king. When Vessantara went into exile, she, with her two 
children, Jāli and Kanhājinā, accompanied him. At Vankagiri she and the children 
occupied one of the hermitages provided for them by Vissakamma, at Sakka’s 
orders. While she was getting fruit and leaves, Jūjaka obtained from Vessantara 
the two children as slaves. Maddī the previous night had had a dream warning her 
of this, but Vessantara had consoled her. When she came back from her quest for 
food later than usual, the gods having contrived to detain her, she found the 
children missing, and searched for them throughout the night. It was at dawn the 
next day, on her recovery from a death like swoon, that Vessantara told her of 
the gift of the children, describing the miracles, which had attended the gift 
and showing how they presaged that he would reach Enlightenment. Maddī, 
understanding, rejoiced herself in the gift.</p>
<p>The next day Sakka appeared in the guise of a brahmin and 
asked Vessantara, to give him Maddī as his slave. Seeing him hesitate, Maddī 
urged him to let her go, saying that she belonged to him to do as he would with 
her. The gift was made and accepted by Sakka. He then, however, gave her back, 
with praises of Vessantara and Maddī. For these details see the Vessantara 
Jātaka; we also Cyp.i.9; Mil.117, 281 f; J.i.77; DhA.i.406.</p>
<p>Maddī is identified with Rāhulamātā.</p>
