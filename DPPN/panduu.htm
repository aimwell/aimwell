<p>A nation in South India, the Pandiyas. Their country 
comprised the greater part of the Madura and Tinnevelly, with its capital first 
at Kolkai and later at Madhurā. </p>
<p>Ceylon was inconstant communication with this country, 
both peaceful and otherwise. Marauding bands of Pandūs often came to Ceylon and, 
having deposed the rightful sovereign, ruled over the country. Chief among these 
invasions were the following: (a) for fourteen years, when Vattagāmani lay in 
hiding; (b) for twenty seven years, after the death of Mahānāma and until 
Dhātusena established his authority; (c) in the time of Sena I.; (d) after the 
death of Mahinda V. They also came with Māgha and Candabhānu, and, later, with 
Āryacakkavattin, who succeeded in carrying the Tooth Relic away to the Pāndyan 
court; this was later rescued by Parakkamabāhu III. Sometimes the Singhalese 
kings would make reprisals by invading the Pāndyan territory&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., 
in the reign of Sena II., and, perhaps also, under Nissanka Malla. Parakkamabāhu 
I. sent an army under his general Lankāpura to help the Pāndyan king Parākrama 
Pāndya against the Cola king, Kulasekhara. This, according to the Mahāvamsa 
account, brought great joy to the Singhalese.</p>
<p>Mention is made in the chronicles of several marriages 
between members of the Pāndyan and the Singhalese royal families. Vijaya himself 
took his consort from the Pāndyan king at Madhurā, and later, Mittā, sister of 
Vijayabāhu I., married a Pāndyan prince who became the grandfather of 
Parakkamabāhu 1. This led to the establishment of a “Pāndyan party” in Ceylon 
which was not always loyal to the reigning monarch&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., in the case 
of Vikkamabāhu III. Parakkama Pandu, who deposed Līlāvati, evidently belonged to 
this party and probably also Vijaya III. The Pāndyan kings claimed descent from 
the Lunar race. </p>
