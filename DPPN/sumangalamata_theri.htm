<p>She was born in a poor family of Sāvatthi and was married 
to a rush-plaiter (nalakāra). </p>
<p>Her first child was a son, named Sumangala, who left the 
world and became an arahant (See Sumangala 7). </p>
<p>She became a nun, and one day, while reflecting on all she 
had suffered in the lay life, she was much affected, and, her insight 
quickening, she became an arahant. Thig.vss.23-24; ThigA.28f.</p>
