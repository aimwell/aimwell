<p>1. Kadamba, Kadambaka.-The river that 
flows past Anurādhapura, on the eastern side, now called the Malvatu Oya 
(Mhv.vii.43; and Trs.58, n.3). Near the river was the Nivatta-cetiya 
(Mhv.xv.10). The river ford, the Gangalatittha (MT.361), formed the beginning of 
the boundary line of the sīmā of the Mahāvihāra, and this line also ended at the 
river bank (Mhv.xv.191). The road from Anurādhapura to Cetiyagiri lay across the 
Kadamba-nadī, and pious kings, such as Mahā-Dāthika-Mahā-Nāga, spread carpets 
from the river up to the mountain so that pilgrims could wash their feet in the 
river and approach the mountain shrines with clean feet (Mhv.xxxiv.78).</p>
<p>The road from the Kadamba river to 
Thūpārāma passed through the Rājamātudvāra (SA.i.173). Moggallāna II. dammed up 
the river among the mountains and thus formed three tanks, the Pattapāsānavāpi, 
the Dhanavāpi, and the Garītara (Cv.xli.61), and Udaya II. built a weir for the 
overflow of the river (Cv.li.130).</p>
<p>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, the 
capital of Ceylon, Abhayanagara, lay to the east of Kadambanadī (Mhv.xv.59; 
Dpv.xv.39; xvii.12; see also Mbv.120, 134f).</p>
<p>See also Kalamba.</p>
<p>2. Kadamba.-A mountain near Himavā. 
Seven Pacceka Buddhas once lived there. Ap.ii.382.</p>
