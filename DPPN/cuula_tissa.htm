<p>A minister of Dutthagāmanī. Once when 
Kandula was lost, he was sent in search and found him looking after the monks of 
Mahānijjhara. Tissa gave the monks a drink of kāra-fruit and sugar, and took the 
animal back to the king. Later, Tissa was born in Ambavitthi and entered the 
Order. Afterwards, while on a voyage to the Bodhi-tree in Gayā, his ship ran 
short of water. Tissa let down his bowl into the sea. The water became fresh and 
sweet, and he shared it with the others. After death he was born in the deva 
world. Ras.ii.29f.</p>
