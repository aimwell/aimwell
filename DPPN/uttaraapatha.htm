<p>The northern division of <a href="jambudiipa.htm" title="j/jambudiipa.htm">Jambudīpa</a>. Its 
boundaries are nowhere explicitly stated in Pāli literature. It has been 
suggested (See Law, Early Geog. of Bsm., pp.48ff) that Uttarāpatha was 
originally the name of a great trade-route, the northern high road which 
extended from <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a> to 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a> in <a href="gandhaara.htm" title="g/gandhaara.htm">Gandhāra</a>, and that it lent its name — as 
did the Dakkhināpatha — to the region through which it passed. If this be so, 
the name would include practically the whole of Northern India, from 
<a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Anga</a> in the 
east to Gandhāra in the north-west, and from the Himālaya in the north to the 
Vindhyā in the south. According to the brahmanical tradition, as recorded in the 
Kāvyamīmāmsā (p.93), the Uttarāpatha is to the west of Prithudaka (Pehoa, about 
fourteen miles west of Thāneswar).</p>
<p>The chief divisions included in this 
territory are mentioned in the Pāli literature as Kasmīra-Gandhāra and Kamboja. 
This region was famous from very early times for its horses and horse-dealers 
(See, e.g., Vin.iii.6; Sp.i.175), and horses were brought down for sale from 
there to such cities as Benares (J.ii.287).</p>
<p>In Uttarāpatha was Kamsabhoga, where, in 
the city of Asitañjana, King Mahākamsa reigned (J.iv.79). The Divyāvadana 
(p.470) mentions another city, Utpalavatī.</p>
<p>According to the Mahāvastu (iii.303), 
Ukkala, the residence of <a href="tapassu.htm" title="t/tapassu.htm">Tapassu</a> and 
<a href="bhallika.htm" title="b/bhallika.htm">Bhalluka</a>, was in Uttarāpatha, as well as 
<a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, the famous university (Mtu.ii.166).</p>
<p>There was regular trade between Sāvatthi 
and Uttarāpatha (PvA.100). </p>
<p><a href="anganika_bh.htm" title="ay/anganika_bh.htm">Anganika Bhāradvāja</a> had friends in 
Uttarāpatha (ThagA.i.339).</p>
