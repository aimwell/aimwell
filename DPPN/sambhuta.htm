<p><b>1. Sambhūta. </b>A candāla, brother of Citta. He was 
the Bodhisatta’s sister’s son. See the Citta Sambhūta Jātaka. Sambhūta is 
identified with Ānanda. J.iv.401.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="2">2</a>. Sambhūta Thera.</b> A brahmin of 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> who, with 
his friends, <a href="bhuumija_th.htm" title="b/bhuumija_th.htm">Bhūmija</a>, 
<a href="jeyyasena.htm" title="j/jeyyasena.htm">Jeyyasena</a> and <a href="abhiraadhana.htm" title="am/abhiraadhana.htm">Abirādhana</a>, entered the Order. Because he 
stayed continuously in the <a href="sitavana.htm" title="s/sitavana.htm">Sītavana</a>, meditating on the nature of the body, he 
came to be called “Sītavaniya.” In due course he won arahantship, and the 
verses, declaring his aññā, are included in the 
<a href="theragaathaa.htm" title="t/theragaathaa.htm">Theragāthā</a> (Thag.vs.6).</p>
<p>It is said (ThagA.i.46) that when Sambhūta was meditating, 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> passing that way, saw him and worshipped him, and left two Yakkhas to 
keep guard and to tell Sambhūta of his visit. When the Thera had finished his 
meditations, the Yakkhas gave him Vessavana’s message offering him protection. 
But he refused their protection saying that the mindfulness taught by the Buddha 
was sufficient guard. On his return journey, Vessavana again visited him, and, 
realizing from the appearance of the Elder that he had achieved his goal, went 
to the Buddha at Sāvatthi and announced to him Sambhūta’s attainment.</p>
<p>Sambhūta had been a householder in the time of Atthadassī 
Buddha, and conveyed the Buddha and a large company across a river. He is 
probably identical with Taraniya Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.i.204f.; see also 
VibhA.306 and SA.iii.201, where Sambhūta is given as an example of one who 
developed lokuttaradhamma by developing the heart (cittam dhuram katvā).</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="3">3</a>. Sambhūta Thera. </b>He belonged to a family of 
clansmen and joined the Order under Ānanda, after the Buddha’s death, attaining 
arahantship in due course.  </p>
<p>He lived in the bliss of emancipation, till one 
century after the Buddha’s death, and, when the 
<a href="vajjiputtakaa.htm" title="va/vajjiputtakaa.htm">Vajjiputtaka</a> heresy arose, his 
help was sought by <a href="yasa.htm" title="y/yasa.htm">Yasa Kākandakaputta</a>.  </p>
<p>At that time he lived on <a href="ahogangaa.htm" title="am/ahogangaa.htm">Ahogangapabbata</a> 
and was called <b>Sānavāsī</b> because he wore a hempen robe.  </p>
<p>At the assembly of the 
arahants held on Ahogangapabbata, <a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta</a> suggested that they should seek the 
support of <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Soreyya Revata</a>. Together they went to 
<a href="sabbakama.htm" title="sa/sabbakama.htm">Sabbakāmī</a>, and <a href="sambhuta.htm" title="sa/sambhuta.htm">Sambhūta</a> 
questioned him regarding the “Ten Points.”  </p>
<p>Sambhūta was one of the monks 
appointed to the committee to discuss the points raised, and when they were 
declared heretical, he joined in the holding of the Second Council. Vin.ii.298 
f., 303ff.; ThagA.i.390 f.; Mhv.iv.18, 57; Dpv.iv.49; v.22; Sp.i.34f.</p>
<p>A series of verses uttered by Sambhūta, moved by righteous 
emotion at the proposed perversion of the Dhamma and 
Vinaya by the Vajjiputtakas, is included in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.291 4).</p>
<p>In the past, during a period when there were no Buddhas in 
the world, Sambhūta was a kinnara on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and seeing a 
Pacceka Buddha, he worshipped him and offered him ajjuna flowers.  </p>
<p>He is 
evidently identical with Ajjunapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.i.450.</p>
