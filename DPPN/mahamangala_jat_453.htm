<h2>Mahāmangala Jātaka (No. 453)</h2>
<p>The Bodhisatta, called Rakkhita, was born in a wealthy 
brahmin family. He married, and then, having distributed all his wealth, became 
an ascetic with five hundred followers. During the rains, his disciples went to 
Benares and dwelt in the king’s park, while Rakkhita stayed in the hermitage. At 
that time there was a great discussion going on among men as to what constituted 
auspiciousness, and Rakkhita’s disciples, on being consulted, said that Rakkhita 
would solve the problem. They, therefore, went to Rakkhita’s hermitage and asked 
him the question, which he answered in a series of eight verses. (The mangalas 
enumerated in these verses differ from those given in the Mangala Sutta). The 
disciples, having learnt the verses, returned to Benares, where they expounded 
them, thus setting all doubts at rest.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the preaching of the 
<a href="mangala_s.htm" title="ma/mangala_s.htm">Mahāmangala Sutta</a>. It happened that in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> there was a large assembly at 
the Santhāgāra, and a man rose and went out, saying, “This is a day of good 
omen.” Some one, hearing this, inquired the meaning of “good omen.” One said, 
“The sight of a lucky thing is a good omen.” But this was denied, and then began 
the discussion on omens, which, in the end, was carried to Sakka, and referred 
by him to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The senior disciple of Rakkhita is identified with 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> (J.iv.72 9).</p>
