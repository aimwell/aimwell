<p>A greengrocer of Benares had a pretty daughter who was 
always laughing. Before agreeing to give her in marriage, her father wished to 
test her virtue, lest she should bring disgrace on his name. He took her into 
the forest and whispered to her words of love. When she expressed her horror, he 
was convinced of her innocence and agreed to the marriage. The Bodhisatta was a 
Treesprite and witnessed the incident. The story was related to a greengrocer in 
Sāvatthi who treated his daughter in a similar way. He later visited the Buddha 
and told him the story. The characters were identical in both cases. J.i.411f.</p>
