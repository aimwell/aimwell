<p>A brahmin, one of the <a href="bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="b/bhaaradvaaja.htm">Bhāradvājas</a>. </p>
<p>Once, when he was performing Fire-rites on the banks of 
the Sundarikā, he looked round to see if there were anyone, to whom he could 
give what was left over from the oblations. He saw the Buddha seated under a 
tree, his head covered; (to rouse the brahmin’s curiosity and to prevent him 
from being repelled by the sight of a shaven head, says the Commentary) he 
approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The 
Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika 
draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the 
Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was 
not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered 
him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept 
presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the 
water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once 
been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water 
hiss and seethe with steam and smoke. Alarmed and with hair on end, he 
worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him. Sundarika entered the Order and 
became an arahant. S.i.167f. The account of the meeting between the Buddha and 
Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipāta too (p.79 f.), but there the details 
differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same. Several additional 
verses are attributed to the Buddha regarding the true “sacrifice.” The 
Commentary calls the SN. discourse the Pūralāsa Sutta (SNA.ii.400).</p>
<p>Sundarika-Bhāradvāja was so called from his habit of 
offering oblations on the banks of the Sundarikā (SA.i.181f). He is also 
mentioned (M.i.39f) as meeting the Buddha on the banks of the Bāhukā and asking 
him whether he bathed in that river, because it had the reputation of cleansing 
sins. The Buddha answered that purity was not to be won that way and preached to 
him the <a href="vatthuupama_sutta.htm" title="va/vatthuupama_sutta.htm">Vatthūpama Sutta</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.163), 
Sundarika was the brother of <a href="akkosaka_bhaaradvaaja.htm" title="am/akkosaka_bhaaradvaaja.htm">Akkosaka</a> and 
<a href="bilangika.htm" title="b/bilangika.htm">Bilangika Bhāradvāja</a>. There he is 
mentioned as having abused the Buddha in much the same way as Akkosaka.</p>
