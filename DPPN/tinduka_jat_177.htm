<p>The Bodhisatta was once the leader of 
eighty thousand monkeys. Near their dwelling place was a village where grew a 
tinduka tree, whose sweet fruits were eaten by the monkeys. But the people came 
and built a village near the tree and the monkeys could no longer take the 
fruit. One night, when the villagers were asleep, they crept up to the tree and 
began eating the fruit. A villager gave the alarm and the monkeys were in great 
danger of being slain when dawn came. But the Bodhisatta comforted them and kept 
them in good humour until they were rescued by his nephew, Senaka, who set fire 
to the village, distracting the attention of the people, thus allowing the 
monkeys to escape. </p>
<p>The story was related in illustration of 
the Bodhisatta’s sagacity (J.ii.76f). </p>
<p>Senaka is identified with Mahānāma the 
Sākiyan. v.l. Tinduka.</p>
