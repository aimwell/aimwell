<p>Preached at Sāvatthi on Komudī, the 
full-moon day of the fourth month. The monks had gathered together to see the 
Buddha and eminent disciples had been busy instructing their pupils in the 
various attainments. The Commentary says the Buddha had not gone on tour as 
usual because he wanted to give the monks opportunity of developing their 
attainments. (MA.ii.895-6.) </p>
<p>Seeing them thus assembled, the Buddha 
was pleased with their demeanour and described how in the confraternity of monks 
were to be found men of various degrees of attainment. Some of them practised 
the cultivation of mindfulness by breathing exercises and the Buddha proceeded 
to explain how it was done. Such mindfulness leads to the development of the 
four satipatthānas, and these, in turn, to the seven bojjhangas. Through them 
one attains deliverance through understanding. M.iii.78-88.</p>
