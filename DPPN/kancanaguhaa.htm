<p>A cave in the region of the Himālaya, 
according to one description (J.ii.176; but see J.v.357, where it is said to be 
near Cittakūta) in the face of the Cittakūapabbata. This cave was the abode of 
the Bodhisatta when he was born as a lion, as described in the Virocana Jātaka 
(J.i.491f), and again in the Sigāla Jātaka (J.ii.6). Near by was the 
Rajatapabbata. This cave was also the dwelling-place of the geese mentioned in 
the Kacchapa Jātaka (J.ii.176), and in the cave grew the Abbhanta-ramba 
(J.ii.396), the property of Vessavana. In the scholiast to the Hatthipāla Jātaka 
(J.iv.484), the Kañcanagūha is mentioned as the abode of the spider Unnābhi and 
the ninety-six thousand geese who took shelter in it, waiting for the rains to 
clear. Near the cave was the Chaddantadaha and the Buddha, when he was born as 
the elephant Chaddanta, made the cave his headquarters (J.v.37f). In this 
context the cave is described as being in the Suvannapabbata (probably another 
name for Kañcanapabbata) to the west of the Chaddanta lake, and is said to be 
twelve leagues in extent. There lived the elephant king with eight thousand 
companions. Nandatāpasa once lived for seven days at the entrance to the cave, 
going to Uttarakuru for his food (J.v.316, 392).</p>
<p>The Pākahamsas of great power also lived 
in the cave (J.v.357, 368), once as many in number as ninety thousand (J.v.381).</p>
<p>In the Sudhābhojana Jātaka (J.v.392), 
the cave is stated to have been on the top of Manosilātala.</p>
<p>The Kañcanagūha is mentioned in 
literature as the dwelling-place of maned lions (kesarasīhā) (E.g., UdA.71, 
105).</p>
