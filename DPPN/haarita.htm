<p><b>2. Hārita. </b>A

who was present at the preaching of the <a href="maha_samaya_s.htm" title="maha/maha_samaya_s.htm">Mahāsamaya Sutta</a>, at the head of one 
hundred thousand other Brahmās (D.ii.261; DA.ii.693; cf. DA.i.40). </p>
<p>He was one of the chief Brahmās. See, e.g., DA.ii.693; 
MA.ii.576.</p>

<p><b>3. Hārita Thera<span lang="en-us">. </b>
He was the son of a wealthy brahmin of Sāvatthi, and had a 
beautiful wife. One day, while contemplating her beauty, he realized that it was 
impermanent. A few days later his wife was bitten by a snake and died. In his 
anguish he sought the Buddha, and, comforted by him, left the world. For some 
time he could not concentrate. Then one day, going to the village for alms, he 
saw a fletcher straightening his arrow. So he turned back and stirred up 
insight. The Buddha, standing in the air above him, admonished him in a verse, 
and Hārita attained arahantship.</p>
<p>Thirty one kappas ago he offered some kutaja-flowers to a 
Pacceka Buddha, named Sumana (Thag.vs.29; ThagA.i.87f). He is evidently 
identical with Kutajapupphiya Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.451.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Hārita Thera<span lang="en-us">. </b>
He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi, and, because of pride of birth, 
used to call others low born. Later he entered the Order, but even then this 
habit persisted. One day, after hearing the Buddha preach, he reviewed his mind, 
and was distressed by his conceit and arrogance. Thereupon, putting forth 
effort, he conjured up insight and won arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he offered perfumes at 
the Buddha’s funeral pyre (Thag.vss.261-3; ThagA.i.376f). He is evidently 
identical with Gandhapūjaka Thera of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.406.</p>

<p><b>6. Hārita Thera</b>. An arahant. 
<a href="dhammadassii.htm" title="d/dhammadassii.htm">Dhammadassī Buddha</a> 
preached to him in the Sudassanārāma and declared him foremost of those who 
practised austerities. BuA.183.</p>
