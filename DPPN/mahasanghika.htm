<h2>Mahāsanghikā, Mahāsangītikā</h2>
<p>One of the Buddhist schools which separated out from the 
Theravādins at the Second Council. The members rejected the Parivāra, the six 
sections of the Abhidhamma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa and some portions 
of the Jātakas (KvuA. p. 4; Dpv.v.32ff). </p>
<p>The school was so called owing to the great number of its 
followers, which made a great assembly or “Mahāsangitī.” They were counted among 
the Anātmavādins, and later gave rise to the following schools: the </p>
<ul>
  <li>Mahāsanghika, </li>
  <li>Pubbasela, </li>
  <li>Aparasela, </li>
  <li>Rājagiriyā, </li>
  <li>Hemavatas, </li>
  <li>Cetiyavādins, </li>
  <li>Sankantivādins and </li>
  <li>Gokulikas. </li>
</ul>
<p>Originally they had only two divisions&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
Ekabbohārikas and Gokulikas (Rockhill, op. cit., 182ff). </p>
<p>Their separation from the orthodox school was brought 
about by the Vajjiputta monks, and was probably due to difference of opinion on 
the ten points (for these see Vin.ii.294f) held by the Vajjiputta monks. 
According to Northern sources, however, the split occurred on the five points 
raised by Mahādeva: </p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) An arahant may commit a sin under unconscious 
  temptation; </li>
  <li>(2) one may be an arahant and unconscious of the fact;
  </li>
  <li>(3) an arahant may have doubts on matters of doctrine;
  </li>
  <li>(4) one cannot attain arahantship without the help of a 
  teacher; </li>
  <li>(5) the “Noble Way” may begin with some such 
  exclamation as “How sad!” uttered during meditation (J.R A.S. 1910, p. 416; 
  cf. MT 173). </li>
</ul>
<p>These articles of faith are found in the Kathāvatthu 
(173ff., 187ff., 194, 197), attributed to the Pubbaselas and the Aparaselas, 
opponents of the Mahāsanghika school. </p>
<p>According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal.ii.164), the 
Mahāsanghikas divided their canon into five parts: Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, 
Miscellaneous and Dhāranī. Fa Hsien took from Pātaliputta to China a complete 
transcript of the Mahāsanghika Vinaya. (Giles, p. 64, Nañjio’s Catalogue 
mentions a Mahāsanghika Vinaya and a Mahāsanghabhiksunī Vinaya in Chinese 
translations, Cola. 247, 253. Ms. No.543). </p>
<p>The best known work of the Mahāsanghikas is the Mahāvastu. 
Their headquarters in Ceylon were in Abhayagiri vihāra, and Sena I. is said to 
have built the Vīrankurārāma for their use. Cv.1.68.</p>
