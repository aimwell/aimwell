<p>A paribbājikā of some ascetic Order. 
When the heretics of this Order found that their gains were grown less owing to 
the popularity of the Buddha, they enlisted the support of Ciñcā in their 
attempts to discredit him. She was very beautiful and full of cunning, and they 
persuaded her to pretend to pay visits to the Buddha at Jetavana. She let 
herself be seen going towards the vihāra in the evening, spent the night in the 
heretics' quarters near by, and in the morning men saw her returning from the 
direction of the vihāra. When questioned, she said that she had passed the night 
with the Buddha. After some months she simulated pregnancy by tying a disc of 
wood round her body and appearing thus before the Buddha, as he preached to a 
vast congregation, she charged him with irresponsibility and callousness in that 
he made no provision for her confinement. The Buddha remained silent, but 
Sakka’s throne was heated and he caused a mouse to sever the cords of the wooden 
disc, which fell to the ground, cutting Ciñcā’s toes. She was chased out of the 
vihāra by those present, and as she stepped outside the gate the fires of the 
lowest hell swallowed her up (DhA.iii.178f; J.iv.187f; ItA.69).</p>
<p>In a previous birth, too, she had helped 
in various ways to harm the Bodhisatta. For details see:</p>

<p>It is stated (Ap.i.299; UdA.263f) that 
the Buddha was subjected to the ignominy of being charged by Ciñcā with 
incontinence, because in a previous birth he had reviled a Pacceka Buddha. v.l. 
Ciñcī; cp. Sundarī. </p>
