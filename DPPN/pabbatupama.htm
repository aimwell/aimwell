<h4>1. Pabbatūpama Sutta</h4>
<p>Pasenadi comes to the Buddha and tells him that he has 
been much occupied with kingly matters. The Buddha reminds him by means of a 
parable that old age and death are ceaselessly rolling on upon him, like mighty 
mountains crushing everything in their way. Against such an advance his 
counsellors and his armies would be useless, and the king admits that leading 
the righteous life is the only way (S.i.100f). The Commentary adds (SA.i.131f ) 
that on the occasion of this visit the king had been attacked by bandits lying 
in wait for him in the Andhavana. He had, however, been warned, and, having 
surrounded the wood destroyed the bandits.</p>

<h4>2. Pabbatūpama Sutta</h4>
<p>The dukkha which one Ariyan disciple who has won 
understanding has destroyed, placed beside the dukkha which remains to be 
destroyed, would be like the whole Himālaya beside seven grains of gravel the 
size of mustard seeds. S.v.464.</p>
<hr>
<h4>3. Pabbatūpama Sutta</h4>
<p>Same as (2) above, except that the simile used is that of 
the Himalayas as it is, compared with what it would be if it were wasted away to 
the size of seven grains of gravel the size of mustard seeds. S.v.465.</p>
