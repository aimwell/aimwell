<p><b>1. Cunda</b>.-A worker in metals (kammāraputta) 
living in <a href="pava.htm" title="pa/pava.htm">Pāvā</a>. When the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> reached Pāvā on his way to 
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusinārā</a>, he stayed 
in Cunda’s Mango grove. There Cunda visited him and invited him and the monks to 
a meal the next day. The meal consisted of sweet rice and cakes and 
sūkaramaddava. At the meal the Buddha ordered that he alone should be served 
with sūkaramaddava, and that what was left over should be buried in a hole. This 
was the Buddha’s last meal, as very soon after it he developed dysentery 
(D.ii.126; Ud.viii.5). The Buddha, a little while before his death, gave special 
instructions to <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> that he should visit Cunda and reassure him by telling 
him that no blame at all attached to him and that he should feel no remorse, but 
should, on the contrary, rejoice, in that he had been able to give to the Buddha 
a meal which, in merit, far exceeded any other (D.ii.135f).</p>
<p>The Suttanipāta Commentary (SNA.i.159) 
mentions that, at this meal, Cunda provided golden vessels for the monks' use; 
some made use of them, others did not. One monk stole a vessel and put it in his 
bag. Cunda noticed this but said nothing. Later, in the afternoon, he visited 
the Buddha and questioned him as to the different kinds of samanas there were in 
the world. The Buddha preached to him the <a href="cunda_s.htm" title="c/cunda_s.htm">Cunda Sutta</a>.  </p>
<p>The Commentary 
adds (p.166; also UdA.399) that Cunda reached no attainment, but merely had his 
doubts dispelled. The Digha Commentary, however, says (DA.ii.568) 
that he became a  Sotāpanna at the first sight of the Buddha and built for him a 
vihāra at the <a href="ambavana.htm" title="am/ambavana.htm">Ambavana</a>. This latter incident, probably, took place at an earlier 
visit of the Buddha, for we are told (D.iii.207) that 
while the Buddha was staying in Cunda’s Mango grove, he was invited by the 
Mallas to consecrate their new Mote-hall, <a href="ubbhataka.htm" title="u/ubbhataka.htm">Ubbhataka</a>. He accepted the invitation, 
preached in the hall till late at night, and then requested Sāriputta to 
continue, which he did by preaching the <a href="sangiti_sutta.htm" title="sa/sangiti_sutta.htm">Sangīti Sutta</a>. This was soon after the 
death of <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta</a> (D.iii.210).  </p>
<p>The Anguttara 
Nikāya (v.263ff) mentions another conversation between 
the Buddha and Cunda. Cunda tells the Buddha that he approves of the methods of 
purification (soceyyāni) laid down by the brahmins of the west (Pacchābhūmakā). 
The Buddha tells him of the teaching of the Ariyans regarding the threefold 
defilement and purification of the body, the fourfold defilement and 
purification of the speech, and the threefold defilement and purification of the 
mind. Cunda accepts the Buddha’s explanations and declares himself his follower.</p>

<p><b>2. Cunda</b>.-The books appear to 
refer to two theras by the name of Cunda, the better known being <b>Mahā-Cunda</b> and 
the other Cūla-Cunda. But the legends connected with them are so confused that 
it is not possible to differentiate clearly one from the other.  </p>
<p>Mention is also 
made of a <b>Cunda-Samanuddesa</b> whom, however, the Commentaries (E.g.. 
DA.iii.907) identify with Mahā-Cunda. Mahā-Cunda is, for 
instance, described in the Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.261; see also 
DhA.ii.188 and AA.ii.674) as the younger brother of 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>, under whom he 
joined the Order, winning arahantship after arduous and strenuous effort. </p>
<p>In the 
time of <a href="vipassii.htm" title="vy/vipassii.htm">Vipassī</a> Buddha he had been a potter and had given to the Buddha a bowl 
made of clay. The Apadāna verses quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary are, in the 
Apadāna itself (Ap.ii.444), ascribed to a monk named
<a href="ekapattadaayaka_th.htm" title="e/ekapattadaayaka_th.htm">Ekapattadāyaka</a>. They make 
no mention whatever of his relationship to Sāriputta. On the other hand, there 
are to be found elsewhere in the Apadāna (Ap.i.101f) certain verses ascribed to 
a Cunda Thera, which definitely state that he was the son of the brahmin
<a href="vanganta.htm" title="va/vanganta.htm">Vanganta</a>, and that his mother was 
<a href="rupasari.htm" title="r/rupasari.htm">Sārī</a>. But in these verses he is called Cūla-Cunda, 
and mention is made of his previous birth in the time of 
<a href="siddhattha.htm" title="s/siddhattha.htm">Siddhattha</a> Buddha, to 
whom he gave a bouquet of jasmine flowers. As a result he became king of the 
devas seventy-seven times and was once king of men, by name Dujjaya. It is 
further stated that he became arahant while yet a sāmanera and that he waited 
upon the Buddha and his own brother and other virtuous monks. This account goes 
on to say that after his brother’s death, Cunda brought his relics in a bowl and 
presented them to the Buddha, who uttered praises of Sāriputta. This would 
identify Cūla-Cunda with Cunda Samanuddesa who, according to the Samyutta Nikāya 
(S.v.161f), attended Sāriputta in his last illness and, after his death, brought 
to the Buddha at <a href="jetavana.htm" title="j/jetavana.htm">Jetavana</a> Sāriputta’s bowl and outer robe and his relics wrapt 
in his water-strainer. Therefore if Buddhaghosa is correct in identifying Cunda 
Samanuddesa with Mahā-Cunda, then all three are one and the same. (Buddhaghosa 
says that the monks called him Samanuddesa in his youth before his upasampadā, 
and he never lost the name, DA.iii.907).</p>
<p>Cunda Samanuddesa was, for some time, 
the personal attendant of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (ThagA.ii.124; J.iv.95, etc.), and when the 
Buddha prepared to perform the Twin Miracle, offered to perform a miracle 
himself and so save the Buddha trouble and exertion (DhA.iii.211). Cunda’s 
teacher was <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a>, and it was to Ānanda that he first brought the news of 
Sāriputta’s death. (SA.iii.178; see also the <a href="pasadika_sutta.htm" title="pa/pasadika_sutta.htm">Pāsādika Sutta</a> and the
<a href="samagama.htm" title="sa/samagama.htm">Sāmagāma 
Sutta</a>, where Cunda brings to Ānanda and then to the Buddha the news of 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha Nātaputta’s</a> death; see also the
<a href="sallekha_sutta.htm" title="sa/sallekha_sutta.htm">Sallekha Sutta</a>).</p>
<p>Mahā-Cunda was evidently a disciple of 
great eminence, and is mentioned by the Buddha (A.iii.299; see also M.iii.78; 
Ud.i.5) in company with the Two Chief Disciples, 
<a href="maha_kassapa_th.htm" title="maha/maha_kassapa_th.htm">Mahā Kassapa</a>, 
<a href="maha_kotthita.htm" title="maha/maha_kotthita.htm">Mahā Kotthita</a>, 
<a href="maha_kaccaana.htm" title="maha/maha_kaccaana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> and other very eminent Elders.</p>
<p>The Pitakas contain several discourses 
(A.iii.355; v.41, 157) given to the monks by Mahā-Cunda while residing at 
<a href="sahajati.htm" title="sa/sahajati.htm">Sahajātī</a> among the Cetis, probably after the Buddha’s death. Cunda (or Cundaka 
as he is called in this context) was with the Buddha in his last journey to 
<a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusinārā</a>, and spread a bed for him in the Mango grove by the Kakutthā River 
(D.ii.134f; Ud.viii.5).  </p>
<p>Cunda is mentioned (S.iv.50f.; M.iii.263f ) as having 
accompanied <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> when he went to see
<a href="channa.htm" title="c/channa.htm">Channa</a> at the <a href="kalandakanivaapa.htm" title="ka/kalandakanivaapa.htm">Kalandakanivāpa</a> in 
<a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a>, just before Channa’s suicide. Once, when the Buddha lay ill in the 
<a href="kalandakanivaapa.htm" title="ka/kalandakanivaapa.htm">Kalandakanivāpa</a>, Cunda visited him and they talked of the  bojjhangas. There and 
then the Buddha’s sickness vanished. S.v.81.</p>
