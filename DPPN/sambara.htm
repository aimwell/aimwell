  <h2>Sambara</h2>

</ul>
<p>A chief of the Asuras. In the “Isayo Samuddakā Sutta” 
(S.i.227) (q.v.) we are told that, because Sambara refused the request of the 
sages for a guarantee of safety, they cursed him, and his mind was deranged. 
Buddhaghosa adds (SA.i.266) that, on account of this mental derangement, he came 
to be called Vepacitti (s.v.). Elsewhere (S.i.239), however, it is said that 
once Sakka asked Vepacitti to teach him Sambara’s magic art (Sambarimāyā). 
Vepacitti consulted the Asuras and then warned Sakka against learning it 
because, through his art, Sambara had fallen into purgatory, where he had been 
suffering for a century. Buddhaghosa, in this context (SA.i.272), calls Sambara 
an Asurinda, a juggler (māyāvī) who, having practised his māyā, has roasted for 
the past century in purgatory.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhys Davis (KS.i.306 n) thinks there was a rank of 
Sambara resembling that of Sakka, and that each succeeding Sambara learnt the 
magic art. See also Samvara.</p>
