<p>A village in the vicinity of 
<a href="bhaddiya.htm#3" title="b/bhaddiya.htm#3">Bhaddiyanagara</a>. The village was one gāvuta distant from the Ganges (MT.560). The 
Buddha went there from Bhaddiyanagara. <a href="bhaddaji_th.htm" title="b/bhaddaji_th.htm">Bhaddaji</a> preceded the 
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> to Kotigāma 
and awaited his arrival there. The people, led by <a href="nanduttara.htm" title="n/nanduttara.htm">Nanduttara</a>, made ready a meal 
and provided boats in which the Buddha and the monks might cross the river. In 
the middle of the river, submerged in the water, stood the palace once occupied 
by  
<a href="mahapanaada.htm" title="maha/mahapanaada.htm">Mahāpanāda</a> (J.ii.332f; ThagA.i.287f; Mhv.xxxi.5f).  </p>
<p>During his last tour the 
Buddha crossed the river at <a href="paataliputta_gama.htm" title="pa/paataliputta_gama.htm">Pātaligāma</a>, went on to Kotigāma, and remained in 
that village preaching to the monks. Hearing that the Buddha was there, 
<a href="ambapaalii.htm" title="am/ambapaalii.htm">Ambapāli</a> 
and hosts of <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavis</a> came from 
<a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> to visit him, and Ambapāli gave him a 
meal. From Kotigāma the Buddha went to Nādikā (Vin.i.230f; D.ii.90f).</p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> says (DA.ii.542; iii.856) 
that the village was so called because it was built near the dome (koti or 
thūpikā) of Mahāpanāda’s palace.</p>
<p>According to the Samyutta Nikāya 
(v.431), Kotigāma was a village of the <a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajjians</a>.</p>
