<p>A clothed Wanderer (channaparibbājaka) (DA.iii.816), who 
lived in a pleasance near Anupiyā. </p>
<p>He was a friend of Sunakkhatta (q.v.). </p>
<p>The Buddha once visited him, and their conversation is 
recorded in the Pātika Sutta (q.v.) (D.iii.1ff). </p>
<p>He was evidently so called because he belonged to the 
gotta named Bhaggava (? potters).</p>
