  <h2>Vajjita Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He belonged to a retainer’s (ibbha) family in Kosala, and, 
because he had come from the Brahma world, he wept whenever a woman took him in 
her arms. Since he thus avoided the touch of women, he came to be called “Vajjita.” 
When of age, he saw the Buddha’s Twin Miracle, entered the Order, and on that 
same day attained arahantship with six fold abhiññā. </p>
<p>Sixty five kappas ago he was born in a remote village as a 
woodsman, and seeing the Pacceka Buddha, Upasanta, he offered him a campaka 
flower (ThagA.i.336). </p>
<p>Two verses spoken by him are included in the Theragāthā 
(vss.215-6).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Ekacampakapupphiya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.288.</p>
