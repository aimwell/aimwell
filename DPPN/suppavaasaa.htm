<p>Mother of <a href="siivalii.htm" title="s/siivalii.htm">Sīvalī</a>. Before he was born, she lay for seven 
days in labour suffering great pain, and it was not till the Buddha blessed her 
that she was able to bring forth the child. It is said that the child was seven 
years in her womb, and the reason for this is given in the 
<a href="asaataruupa_jat_100.htm" title="ay/asaataruupa_jat_100.htm">Asātarūpa Jātaka</a>. </p>
<p>Suppavāsā 
was the daughter of the rājā of <a href="koliyaa.htm" title="ku/koliyaa.htm">Koliya</a> (J.i.407). Her husband was the Licchavi 
<a href="mahali.htm" title="maha/mahali.htm">Mahāli</a>, (Ap.ii.494,vs.28; but see AA.i.244, where her husband is described as a 
Sākiyan noble) and she lived in the Koliyan village of Sajjanela, where the 
Buddha visited her and preached to her on the efficacy of giving food 
(A.ii.62f). She was described by the Buddha as foremost among those who gave 
excellent alms (aggam panītadāyikānam) (A.i.26), an eminence which she had 
earnestly resolved to attain in the time of Padumuttara Buddha (AA.i.244).</p>
<p>She is included in a list of eminent upāsikās (A.iv.348), 
and is mentioned with Anāthapindika, Culla Anāthapindika and Visākhā, as givers 
of gifts which were gladly accepted by the monks. DhA.i.339; in this context she 
is spoken of as living in Sāvatthi; this was probably after 
<a href="mahali.htm" title="maha/mahali.htm">Mahāli</a> went 
to live there; cf. DhA.iv.193f.</p>
