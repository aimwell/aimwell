  <h2>Suddhatthaka Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>The fourth of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. 
</p>
<p>The sutta was preached in reference to Candābha (q.v.) 
(SNA.ii.523f). Mere knowledge of various systems of philosophy cannot purify a 
man, for each sponsor of a system claims superiority for his views, and all go 
from one teacher to another and are never calm and thoughtful. But the wise, who 
have understood the Dhamma, are never led away by passion. They do not embrace 
anything in the world as the highest. SN.vss.788-95.</p>
