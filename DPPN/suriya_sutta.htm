<hr>
<p><b>1. Suriya Sutta.</b> Describes the occasion on which 
Suriya (q.v.) was seized by RƒÅhu. S.i.51.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Suriya Sutta.</b> The Buddha explains to the monks 
the destruction of the world by the gradual appearance of seven consecutive 
suns. Details are given of the havoc caused by each subsequent sun. The sutta is 
intended to show that all things are impermanent; but only those who possess 
Ariyan knowledge realize this. Even so great a teacher as Sunetta (q.v.) could 
not find the way out of sorrow (A.iv.100f). The sutta was also evidently called 
Sattasuriya or Sattasuriyuggamana Sutta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Suriya Sutta.</b> Just as, in the autumn when the 
sky is clear, the sun drives away all darkness, so, of all profitable 
conditions, earnestness is the chief. S.v.44.</p>
