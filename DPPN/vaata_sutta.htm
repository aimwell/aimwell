  <h2>Vāta Sutta</h2>

<p>It is because of clinging to body, etc., that such views 
arise as that winds do not blow, pregnant women do not bring forth, the sun and 
moon neither rise nor set; but all these things are stable as a pillar. These 
vanish with the Ariyan disciple’s doubts regarding suffering, its cause, its 
cessation, and the way to such cessation. S.iii.202f.</p>
