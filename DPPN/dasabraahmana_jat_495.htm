<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as Vidhura, 
counsellor to Koravya of the Yudhitthila-gotta, and king of Indapatta. The 
king’s generosity was unparalleled, but he gained no satisfaction there from as 
all the recipients of his gifts were wicked men. He therefore consulted with 
Vidhura and, after having discussed with him the qualities of real virtue, 
obtained, with Vidhura’s help, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas from the 
Nandapabbata in Himavā and entertained them for seven days.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the Asadisadāna of Pasenadi. Koravya is identified with Ānanda. J.iv.360-8.</p>
