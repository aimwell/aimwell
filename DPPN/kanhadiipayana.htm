<p>1. Kanhadīpāyana.-An ascetic of great 
power. When the Andhakavenhudāsaputtā found themselves unable to capture 
Dvāravatī, because the city rose into the air when attacked, they sought the 
ascetic’s help. He told them that an ass wandered round the city and brayed at 
the sight of an enemy, when the city immediately rose up into the sky. The 
Andhakavenhus sought the ass and begged for his help. Acting on the ass’s 
advice, they tied eight great iron posts to the gates, thus preventing the city 
from rising. In this way they captured it (J.iv.83).</p>
<p>Later, their sons, wishing to test 
Kanhadipānyana’s powers of clairvoyance, played a practical joke on him. They 
tied a pillow to the belly of a young lad, and dressing him up as a woman, took 
him to the ascetic and asked when the baby would be born. The ascetic replied 
that on the seventh day the person before him would give birth to a knot of 
acacia wood which would destroy the race of Vāsudeva. The youths thereupon fell 
on him and killed him, but his prophecy came true (J.iv.87). This ascetic is 
evidently not the one mentioned in the Jātaka bearing his name, for there he is 
identified with the Bodhisatta, while in the story given above the Bodhisatta 
was the ascetic’s contemporary and was called Ghatapandita (q.v.).</p>
<p>The immolation of Kanhadīpāyana and its 
consequences are often referred to. E.g., J.v.114; 267, 273.</p>
<p>2. Kanhadīpāyana.-An ascetic; his story 
is given in the Kanhadīpāyana Jātaka.</p>
