<p>A hermit who lived, with a large number 
of other anchorites, in the Himālaya. He had a young elephant which he had 
reared; being headstrong and rough in speech, he would not listen to the warning 
of his teacher, the Bodhisatta, that it was dangerous to have such a pet. Once 
while the hermits were away the elephant was seized with a frenzy, and when his 
master returned it killed him (J.ii.41-3). </p>
<p>Perhaps the man’s name was Kosiya, 
because we are told (J.vi.501) that Inda was of the Kosiyagotta. </p>
<p>Kātiyāna, who was a brahmin of the 
Kosiyagotta (ThagA.i.450), is addressed in a verse (416) of the Theragāthā as&nbsp; 
Indasagotta.</p>
