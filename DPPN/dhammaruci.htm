<p>1. Dhammaruci.-One of the heterodox 
sects of Ceylon which branched off from the Theravāda (Mhv.v.13). </p>
<p>According to the Nikāya Sangraha (p.11) 
this secession took place four hundred and fifty-four years after the death of 
the Buddha, and in the fifteenth year of the reign of Vattagāmani Abhaya. The 
Nikāya Sangraha gives an account of the origin of this sect. A monk called 
Mahā-Tissa, incumbent of Abhayagiri, was convicted of living in domestic 
intercourse and expelled by the Mahāvihāra fraternity. He thereupon left with 
his followers and lived apart at Abhayagiri. They were strengthened by the 
arrival of some monks from Pallarārāma in South India, descendants of the 
Vajjiputtakas. Their teacher was Dhammaruci, and when they joined the Abhayagiri 
monks, Mahā-Tissa himself took the name of Dhammaruci and his followers became 
known as Dhammarucikas. </p>
<p>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.176) says that 
Dhammarucika was the name given to the monks of Abhayagiri when they seceded 
from the Mahāvihāra, and gives elsewhere (p.676f) the points on which they 
differed from the Theravādins. These points concerned minor teachings of the 
Vinaya. The Dhammarucikas became active in the time of Meghavannābhaya, and the 
king, after an enquiry into the matter, sent sixty of them into exile. They 
again became powerful in the time of Mahāsena, through the influence of 
Sanghamitta, and almost succeeded in destroying the Mahāvihāra. But this 
disaster was averted by the intervention of the king’s friend and counsellor, 
Meghavannābhaya, and Sanghamitta was killed by one of the queens 
(Mhv.xxxvii.17ff).</p>
<p>In spite of Sanghamitta’s untimely end, 
the Dhammarucikas seem to have enjoyed favour in Ceylon during a long period. 
Dhātusena gave over to them the Ambatthala-vihāra, which he built on 
Cetiyapabbata (Cv.xxxviii.75), and Kassapa I, bestowed on them the vihāra he 
built in the Niyyanti garden, and made all provisions for their comfort 
(Cv.xxxix.17). Moggallāna I, gave over to them the Dalha-vihāra (Cv.xxxix.41) 
and Aggabodhi V. the Rājinādīpika-vihāra (Cv.xlviii.1). Sena Ilanga, general of 
Kassapa IV., built for them the Dhammārāma and the Hadayunha-parivena 
(Cv.lii.17, 18).</p>
<p>The Sāgaliyas were an offshoot of the 
Dhammarucikas.</p>
<hr>
<p>2. Dhammaruci Thera.-An arahant. In the 
time of Dipankara Buddha he was a young man named Megha, and on hearing the 
Buddha’s declaration regarding Sumedha, he entered the Order under the latter. 
But, owing to wrong association, he left the Order and murdered his mother. For 
this he suffered in Avīci and was later born as a fish. One day he heard some 
shipwrecked sailors calling on the name of Gotama Buddha for protection, and, 
remembering Dipankara’s prophecy, the fish died. He was then born in Sāvatthi, 
and hearing the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the Order and became an 
arahant. Ap.ii.429f.</p>

<p>3. Dhammaruci.-A Nāga king who gave 
grass to Atthadassī Buddha for his seat. BuA.178.</p>
