<p>King of Pegu (A.C.1460-91); a very 
enlightened monarch. He was first a monk; he then gave up his robes and became 
first the minister and later the son-in-law and successor of Queen Shin-san-bu. 
He sent a mission to Ceylon, where a body of Rāmañña monks were ordained at the 
Kalyāni-sīmā. These returned to Rāmañña and were known as the Sīhalasangha. For 
details see Bode: op. cit., 38f.</p>
