<p>An arahant. One hundred thousand kappas ago she was a 
recluse wandering from one monastery to another. One dark night she sat at the 
foot of the bodhi tree and wished that the tree should shine in radiance. Her 
wish was granted, and for seven days she sat there, and on the ninth day she lit 
five lamps under the tree. After death she was born in Tāvatimsa, and her palace 
was known as Pañcadīpī.</p>
<p>She had the power of seeing in all directions without 
turning her head. She was eighty times queen of the king of the devas. In her 
last life she attained arahantship at the age of seven. Ap.ii.527f.</p>
<p>The same story is told in identical words under the name 
of another Therī, called Pañcadīpikā (Ibid., ii.519f). The verses are also 
attributed in the Therīgāthā Commentary to the Therī Selā. ThigA.62f.</p>
