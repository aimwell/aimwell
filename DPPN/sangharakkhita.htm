<p><b>1. Sangharakkhita Thera.</b> He belonged to a wealthy 
family of Sāvatthi, and, after joining the Order, lived with another monk in a 
forest tract, meditating. Near them a doe had given birth in a thicket to a 
fawn. While she tended it, her love kept her always near it, and she was 
famished for lack of grass and water. On seeing her, the Thera repeated: “Alas! 
this world suffers, bound in bonds of craving,” and with this as his incentive, 
he developed insight and won arahantship. Seeing his companion cherish wrong 
thoughts, the Thera admonished him in a verse, (Thag.vs.109) and he, too, became 
an arahant.</p>
<p>Ninety four kappas ago, Sangharakkhita saw seven Pacceka 
Buddhas at the foot of a rock and offered them kadamba flowers. Ninety two 
kappas ago he was king seven times, under the name of Phulla (ThagA.i.216f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Kadambapupphiya of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.178.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sangharakkhita.</b> A monk, probably of Ceylon. 
Reference is made (Vsm.194; DhsA.200) to a novice under him who, seeing the king 
on an elephant’s back, developed thoughts of the foulness of the body and became 
an arahant.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sangharakkhita.</b> A novice, nephew of Mahānāga 
Thera. He became an arahant in the Tonsure hall, and, having discovered that no 
other monk had made the Vejayanta Pāsāda tremble, on the very day he became an 
arahant, the novice, standing on it, tried in vain to shake it. The nymphs 
within laughed at him. Discomfited, he sought his teacher, who was spending his 
siesta in a cave on the edge of the ocean, and, having consulted him, he 
returned to Vejayanta. The nymphs again laughed at him, but he made a resolve 
that the space on which Vejayanta stood should turn into water. When this 
happened, he touched the pinnacle of the palace with his toe and it rocked till 
the nymphs begged for mercy. DA.ii.558f.</p>

the heir to the throne. Cv.lxxxi.76f.</p>
