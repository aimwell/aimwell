<p>A town in Kosala. It was regarded in the Buddha’s time as 
one of the six great cities of India, the others being Campā, Rājagaha, 
Sāvatthi, Kosambī and Benares (D.ii.146). It was probably the older capital of 
Kosala, and is mentioned as such in the Nandiyamiga Jātaka. J.iii.270; cf. 
Mtu.i.348, 349, 350, where it is called the capital of King Sujāta of the Sākyan 
race. See also the Kumbha Jātaka (J.ii.13), where Sāketa is mentioned as one of 
the places into which alcohol was introduced quite soon after its discovery by 
Sura and Varuna. According to the Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka (J.vi.228), it was 
the birthplace of Bijaka, aeons ago. In this context it is called Sāketā. 
According to a tradition, recorded in the Mahāvastu, Sāketa was the city from 
which Sākyan princes were exiled when they founded Kapilavatthu. E. J. Thomas 
accepts this view (op. cit., 16f.).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.386), however, states 
that the city was founded in the Buddha’s time by Dhanañjaya, father of Visākhā, 
when, at the special invitation of Pasenadi, he went from Rājagaha to live in 
Kosala. On the way to Sāvatthi with Pasenadi, Dhañanjaya pitched his camp for 
the night, and learning from the king that the site of the camp was in Kosalan 
territory and seven leagues from Sāvatthi, Dhanañjaya obtained the king’s 
permission to found a city there. And because the site was first inhabited in 
the evening (sāyam), the city came to be called Sāketa. The Divyāvadāna (211) 
has another explanation of the name, in connection with the coronation of 
Mandhātā (Svayam āgatam svayam āgatam Sāketa Sāketam iti sañjnā samvrttā).</p>
<p>The reference is probably to a new settlement established 
by Dhanañjaya in the old city.</p>
<p>We also learn from the Visuddhimagga (p.390; but see 
below) that the distance from Sāketa to Sāvatthi was seven leagues (yojanas), 
and there we are told that when the Buddha, at the invitation of Cūla subhaddā, 
went from Sāvatthi to Sāketa, he resolved that the citizens of the two cities 
should be able to see each other. In the older books (E.g., Vin.i.253) however, 
the distance is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between 
Sāvatthi and Patitthāna, and is mentioned (SN.vss.1011 1013) as the first 
stopping place out of Sāvatthi. The distance between the two places could be 
covered in one day, with seven relays of horses (M.i.149), but the books contain 
several references (E.g., Vin.i.88, 89, 270; iii.212; iv. 63, 120) to the 
dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with 
robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.</p>
<p>Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was Toranavatthu, and 
it is said (S.iv.374 ff) that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he 
spent a night in Toranavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there. 
Between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was a broad river which could be crossed only by 
boat (Vin.iv.65, 228). Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha 
sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several 
discussions&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., with Kakudha (S.i.54), Mendasira (q.v.), and 
Kundaliya (S.v.73; see also Kālaka Sutta and Jarā Sutta and Sāketa Sutta).</p>
<p>On other occasions he stayed at the Kālakārāma (A.ii.24) 
gifted to the Order by Kālaka(q.v.), and the Tikantakivana (A.iii.169), both of 
which were evidently near the city. Mention is also made (E.g., S.v.174, 298 f.; 
for Sāriputta, see also Vin.i.289) of Sāriputta, Moggallāna and</p>
<p>Anuruddha staying together in Sāketa; Bhaddākāpilāni 
(Vin.iv.292) also stayed there, so did Ānanda. Once when Ānanda was staying in 
the Migadāya in the Anjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā (probably a 
follower of the Jatilas), visited him and questioned him regarding 
concentration. A.iv.427. Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, 
Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā. 
Bhūta Thera (q.v.) was born in a suburb of Sāketa.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.532 f.; cf. DhA.iii.317f. and 
Saketa Jātaka) that there lived at Sāketa a brahmin and his wife who, in five 
hundred lives, had been the parents of the Buddha. When the Buddha visited 
Sāketa they met him, and, owing to their fondness for him, came to be called 
Buddhapitā and Buddhamātā, their family being called Buddhakula.</p>
<p>According to some accounts (E.g., AA.ii.482; but see Cūla-Subhaddā), 
Anāthapindika’s daughter, Cūla-Subhaddā, was married to the son of Kālaka, a 
setthi of Sāketa. Kālaka was a follower of the Niganthas, but he allowed 
Subhaddā to invite the Buddha to a meal. She did this by scattering eight 
handfuls of jasmine-flowers into the air from her balcony. The Buddha read her 
thoughts, and went to Sāketa the next day with five hundred arahants. At Sakka’s 
request, Vessavana (Vissakamma?) provided gabled chambers in which the Buddha 
and his monks travelled by air to Sāketa. At the end of the meal, the Buddha 
preached to Kālakasetthi, who became a sotāpanna, and gave the Kālakārāma for 
the use of the monks.</p>
<p>The Vinaya (Vin.i.270f) mentions another setthi of Sāketa. 
His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even 
skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after 
finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and 
offered to cure her. At first the setthi was sceptic, but in the end allowed 
Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee 
through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahāpanas from her 
and her various kinsmen.</p>
<p>Sāketa, is supposed to be identical with Ayojjhā (CAGI. 
405), but as both cities are mentioned in the Buddha’s time, they are probably 
distinct. Rhys Davids thinks that possibly they adjoined each other “like London 
and Westminster” (Bud. India, p. 39. See also Sāketa Sutta, Sāketa Jātaka, 
Sāketapañha). The site of Sāketa has been identified with the ruins of Sujān Kot, 
on the Sai River, in the Unao district of the modern province of Oudh. The river 
referred to is probably the Sarayū, which flows into the Gharghara, a tributary 
of the Ganges.</p>
