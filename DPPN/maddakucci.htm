<p>A park near Rājagaha, at the foot of Gijjhakūta. It was a 
preserve (migadāya) where deer and game could dwell in safety. When Devadatta, 
wishing to kill the Buddha, hurled a rock down Gijjhakūta, it was stopped midway 
by another rock, but a splinter from it fell on the Buddha’s foot, wounding it 
severely. As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on 
a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvaka-ambavana, where he was 
treated by Jivaka (Vin.ii.193f.; DhA.ii.164ff.; J.iv.430; Mil.179). It is said 
(S.i.27f) that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha 
there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Māra tried to 
stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (S.i.110; this 
visit of Māra is referred to at D.ii.116).</p>
<p>According to the Commentaries (e.g., S.A.i.61; cp. 
J.iii.121f), Maddakucchi was so called because it was there that Bimbisāra’s 
queen, mother of Ajātasattu, tried to bring about an abortion when she was told 
by soothsayers that the child in her womb was destined to bring about 
Bimbisāra’s death. She went into the park unknown to the king and violently 
massaged her womb, but without success. The king heard of this and forbade her 
to visit the park.</p>
<p>Once when Mahā Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in 
his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of 
uposatha, he himself being pure. The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before 
him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing (Vin.i.105).</p>
<p>Maddakucchi was difficult of access monks; who came from 
afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta’s powers to the test, would 
often ask him to provide lodging there for them. Vin.ii.76; iii.159.</p>
