<p>He was born in the family of a kinsman of Sāriputta and 
was given his name because he was a dullard. He heard Sāriputta preach, entered 
the Order, and became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin, who 
became an ascetic. One day he saw the Buddha begging for alms and filled his 
bowl with sweet fruits. Seven hundred kappas ago he was a king, named Sumangala 
(Thag.vs.75; ThagA.i.167). He is evidently identical with Phaladāyaka of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.160f.</p>
