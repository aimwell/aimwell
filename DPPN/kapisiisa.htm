<p>1. Kapisīsa.-A Tamil general subdued by 
Dutthagāmanī at Kacchatittha after a siege of four months. v.l. Kavisīsa. 
Mhv.xxv.12</p>
<p>2. Kapisīsa.-A minister of King 
Vatthagāmanī. One day when the king, accompanied by his queen, was going up the 
steps of the Ākāsa-cetiya at Acchagalla-vihāra, he saw the minister, who had 
come down after the sweeping of the cetiya, sitting by the roadside. Because 
Kapisīsa failed to prostrate himself before the king, the latter slew him 
(Mhv.xxxiii.68f).</p>
