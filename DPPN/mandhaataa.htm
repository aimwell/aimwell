  <h2>Mandhātā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A primeval king, descended from Mahāsammata, Roja, 
Vararoja, Kalyāna, Varakalyāna and Uposatha, the last named being his father. He 
was thus an ancestor of the Sākiyans. J.ii.311; iii.454; Mtu.ii.2; Dpv.iii.5; but 
see SNA.i.352, where the genealogy is slightly different. </p>
<p>He had the seven Jewels of a Cakka-vatti and his four 
Supernatural Powers. When he clenched his left hand and touched it with his 
right, a shower of the seven kinds of jewels fell knee deep from the sky. For 
eighty four thousand years he was a prince, for eighty four thousand a viceroy, 
and for eighty four thousand more a king. His life span was an asankheyya. But 
he grew discontented, and, at the suggestion of his ministers, visited the deva 
world. First he went to the Cātummahārājika world, where he ruled; but still 
unsatisfied, he went to Tāvatimsa. There Sakka welcomed him and gave him half 
his kingdom. Mandhātā ruled there during the lifetime of thirty six Sakkas, each 
Sakka’s life lasting for thirty six million years and sixty times one hundred 
thousand. As time went on, Mandhātā’s craving increased; he wished to kill Sakka 
and gain the whole kingdom. Because of his greed his power waned, and he fell 
from heaven into his park. The gardener announced his arrival to the royal 
family, and they provided a resting place for him and there he lay dying. When 
asked for a message for his people, he wished them to know how even he, in spite 
of his great pomp and power, had to die (J.ii.311ff.; DA.ii.481f.; MA.i.182f.; 
cp. Dvy.210ff).</p>
<p>Mandhātā is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.ii.314). His 
son was Varamandhātā, whose son was Cara and grandson Upacara (or Apacara) 
(J.iii.454; Dpv.iii.6). Mandhātā ruled at Rājagaha (SNA.ii.413; DA.i.132), and 
is named as one of the four persons who attained, while yet in their earthly 
bodies, to the glory of the gods. Mil. 115, 291; MA.ii.737f.; the others being 
Guttila, Sādhīna and Nimi.</p>
<p>He is considered as chief of those given up to the 
pleasures of the senses and as an example of one whose desires could never be 
satisfied. A.ii.17; AA.ii.474; e.g., VibhA.506. Thig.486.</p>
<p>When Mandhātā went to the deva world he was accompanied by 
inhabitants of all the four continents. After his return to earth, however, the 
Cakkaratana, stuck fast in the ground, and the others could not return to their 
homes. They thereupon begged for the intervention of the minister (Parināyaka), 
who was carrying on the government with Mandhātā’s shoes on the throne. He gave 
them lands in Jambudīpa. There those who came from Pubba Videha called their 
land Videharattha; those from Apara goyāna called it Aparantajanapada, and those 
from Uttarakuru dwelt in what afterwards came to be known as Kururattha. 
DA.ii.482; MA.i.183f.</p>
