<p><b>1. Ārāmadūsaka Jātaka (No. 46).</b>-Once in <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> there was a festival and all the townsfolk assembled to keep holiday. 
The king’s gardener, wishing to join in the festivities, approached the king of 
the monkeys who lived in the royal garden and, pointing out to him all the 
benefits the monkeys had derived from their residence there, asked him if he 
would get the monkeys to water the trees in the gardener’s absence. The 
monkey-king agreed and, when the man had gone, distributed the water-skins and 
water-pots among the monkeys. In order that the water should not be wasted, he 
gave instructions to the monkeys that they should pull out the trees by the 
roots and give plenty of water to those plans whose roots went deep and little 
to those with small roots. A wise man, happening to see this being done, and 
reflecting how with every desire to do good, the foolish only succeed in doing 
harm, rebuked the monkey-king.</p>
<p>The story was told by the Buddha while 
staying in a hamlet in Kosala. The squire of the village invited the Buddha and 
his monks to a meal and at the conclusion of the meal gave them leave to stroll 
about in the grounds. In their walk the monks came across a bare patch of land 
and learnt from the gardener that it was caused by a lad who had been asked to 
water the plants there and who, before watering them had pulled them out to see 
how they grew. This was reported to the Buddha, who related the story of the 
past. J.i.249-51. The story is sculptured in the Bharhut Stupa: See Cunningham, 
Pl.xlv.5.</p>

<p><b>2. Ārāmadūsaka Jātaka (No. 268).</b>-Same as 
the above except that the monkeys are asked to water the garden for seven days, 
and the conversation between the wise man (in this case a young man of good 
family belonging to Benares) and the monkey-king is different.</p>
<p>The story is told in reference to a lad 
in Dakkhināgiri and not in Kosala as above. J.ii.345-7.</p>
