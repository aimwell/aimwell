<p>Once the queen of a Benares king, having sworn a false 
oath, became a horse faced yakkha. She served Vessavana for three years and was 
given leave to eat people within a certain range. One day she caught a rich and 
handsome brahmin, and, falling in love with him, made him her husband. When she 
went out she shut him up, lest he should escape. The Bodhisatta was born as 
their son, and, on learning his father’s story, discovered from the yakkha how 
far her power extended, and then escaped with his father. The yakkha followed, 
but they were outside her territory and would not be persuaded to return. She 
gave her son a charm enabling him to trace the footsteps of any person, even 
after the lapse of twelve years. On the strength of his charm, the lad entered 
the service of the king of Benares. One day, the king and his chaplain, wishing 
to test him, stole some treasure, took it away by devious paths, and hid it in a 
tank. The youth recovered it quite easily, tracing their footsteps even in the 
air. The king wished the names of the thieves to be divulged, but this the boy 
would not do. But he related to the king various stories, showing that he knew 
the real culprits. The king, however, insisted on the thieves being denounced, 
and when the boy revealed their names, the assembled populace murdered the king 
and his chaplain and crowned the Bodhisatta as king.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a seven year old boy 
of Sāvatthi who could recognize footsteps. His father put him through a severe 
test, and then went to the Buddha, where the boy found him. When the Buddha 
heard the story he revealed that of the past. The father of the story of the 
past is identified with Mahā Kassapa. J.iii.501 14.</p>
