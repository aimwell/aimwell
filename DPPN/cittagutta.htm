<p><b>1. Cittagutta Thera.</b>-An arahant. He 
lived at the <a href="bodhimanda.htm" title="b/bodhimanda.htm">Bodhimanda-vihāra</a>, and was present, with thirty thousand monks, at 
the foundation of the <a href="mahathupa.htm" title="maha/mahathupa.htm">Mahā-Thūpa</a>. Mhv.xxxix.41; Dpv.xix.6.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Cittagutta.</b>-An Elder living in the Kurandaka Cave. In the cave was a beautiful painting of the Renunciation of the 
Seven Buddhas, but he never saw it, though he lived there for sixty years. Three 
times the king sent for him, but he refused to go until the king decreed that no 
infant in the country should suck milk until the Elder should visit the palace. 
He dwelt in the palace for seven days and always pronounced the same blessing, 
no matter who saluted him: “May the king be happy.” On the Elder’s return to the 
cave, the deity in the ironwood tree outside stood holding a torch and the Elder 
attained arahantship (Vsm.38). It may be the same Elder who is mentioned 
elsewhere (Vsm.171) as having developed tejo-kasina on regarding the flame of a 
lamp on his return to the vihāra after listening to the Dhamma, and again 
pīta-kasina when he saw on Cittalapabbata a seat spread with pattanga-flowers 
(Vsm.173).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Cittagutta.</b>-An arahant. He lived in Ambapāsāna, in the village of Anganakola. He was a fluent speaker, and while yet 
a puthujjana, preached the Rathavinīta Sutta at the Lohapāsāda to a gathering of 
twelve thousand monks and nuns. In his explanation he referred to the glories of 
the Relic Chamber in the Mahā-Thūpa. Though he described them in great detail, 
yet the Elder Mahā Tissa, teacher of Asathakammika-Tissa, being present, told 
him that his description was incomplete (MT.552f). The story is told to indicate 
the magnitude of the glories of the Relic Chamber.</p>
