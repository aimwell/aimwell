<p><a href="brahmadatta.htm" title="b/brahmadatta.htm">Brahmadatta</a>, king of Benares, had two 
sons. When he died the elder refused the crown and retired into a frontier 
village. The people there, discovering his identity, offered to pay their taxes 
to him instead of to the king, and the king, at his request, agreed.  </p>
<p>As his 
power increased, the prince became more covetous and demanded the kingdom, which 
the younger brother gladly renounced. But the elder’s greed was insatiable, and
<a href="sakka.htm" title="sa/sakka.htm">Sakka</a>, to teach him a lesson, came in the guise of a young man and offered to 
capture for him three cities. The king made up his mind to accept the offer; 
but, then the young man could not be found, and the king fell ill of greed.  </p>
<p>The 
Bodhisatta, just returned from <a href="takkasilaa.htm" title="t/takkasilaa.htm">Takkasilā</a>, heard of this, and having obtained the 
king’s leave to treat him, cured him of this disease by showing him the futility 
of his wishes. Thereafter the king became a righteous ruler (J.iv.167ff).</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the 
brahmin to whom the <a href="kaama_s.htm" title="ka/kaama_s.htm">Kāma Sutta</a> was preached. The
<a href="kaamaniita_jat_228.htm" title="ka/kaamaniita_jat_228.htm">Kāmanīta Jātaka</a> was also 
preached in this connection.</p>
