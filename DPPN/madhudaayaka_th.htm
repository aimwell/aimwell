<p>An arahant. Once in the past he was a hermit living on the banks of the Sindhu, 
  and, having seen Sumedha Buddha, he gave him some honey.  </p>
<p>It is said that on 
  the day of his birth there was a shower of honey (Ap.i.325).  </p>
<p>He is probably 
  identical with Mah훮n훮ma Thera. ThagA.i.228.</p>
