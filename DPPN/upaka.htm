<p><b>1. Upaka</b></p>
<p>An <a href="aajiivakaa.htm" title="aa/aajiivakaa.htm">Ājivaka</a> whom the Buddha met 
on his way between <a href="gayaa.htm" title="g/gayaa.htm">Gayā</a> and the Bodhi Tree, after he set out from 
<a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a> for 
the preaching of the First Sermon. Upaka questioned the Buddha on his 
attainments, and when the Buddha told him what he had accomplished he asked the 
Buddha if he were “Anantajina.” When the Buddha acknowledged it, Upaka shook his 
bead saying, “It may be so, friend,” and went along by another road (J.i.81; 
Vin.i.8; M.i.170-1; DhA.iv.71-2). It is said (DA.ii.471) that the Buddha walked 
all the way from the Bodhi Tree to Isipatana — instead of flying through the 
air, as is the custom of Buddhas — because he wished to meet Upaka.</p>
<p>After this meeting Upaka went to the 
<a href="vankahaara.htm" title="va/vankahaara.htm">Vankahāra</a> country and there, having fallen desperately in love with 
<a href="caapaa_thi.htm" title="c/caapaa_thi.htm">Cāpā</a>, 
the daughter of a huntsman who looked after him, starved for seven days and in 
the end persuaded the huntsman to give her to him in marriage. For a living, Upaka hawked about the flesh brought by the huntsman. In due course Cāpā bore 
him a son, Subhadda. When the baby cried, Cāpā sang to him saying, “Upaka’s son, 
ascetic’s son, game-dealer’s boy, don't cry,” thus mocking her husband. In 
exasperation he told her of his friend Anantajina, but she did not stop teasing 
him. One day, in spite of her attempts to keep him, he left her and went to the 
Buddha at <a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. The Buddha, seeing him coming, gave orders that anyone 
asking for Anantajina should be brought to him. Having learnt from Upaka his 
story, the Buddha had him admitted to the Order. As a result of his meditation, 
Upaka became an anāgāmī and was reborn in the <a href="avihaa.htm" title="ay/avihaa.htm">Avihā</a> heaven (ThigA.220ff; 
MA.i.388f. Upaka’s story is also given in SnA.i.258ff, with several variations 
in detail). The Samyutta Nikāya (i.35, 60) records a visit paid to the Buddha by 
Upaka and six other beings born in Avihā. According to the Majjhima Commentary 
(i.389), Upaka became an arahant as soon as he was born in Avihā.</p>
<p>In the Therīgāthā he is also called Kāla 
(v.309. This may have been a term of affection used because of his dark colour) 
and his birth-place is given as Nāla, a village near the Bodhi Tree, where he is 
said to have been living with his wife at the time he left her (ThigA.225).</p>
<p>Later, Cāpā, too, left the world and 
became an arahant Therī. </p>
<p>The Divyāvadana (p.393) calls Upaka 
Upagana.</p>
<p>The enumeration of the Buddha’s virtues 
which was made to Upaka is not regarded as a real dhammadesanā because it took 
place before the preaching of the first sermon. It produced only a 
vāsanā-bhāgiya result, not sekha- or ribaddha-bhāgiya (UdA.54).</p>
<p>The words of the Buddha’s speech to 
Upaka are often quoted (E.g., Kvu.289).</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="2">2</a>. Upaka Mandikāputta.</b>-He once visited 
the Buddha at <a href="gijjhakuuta.htm" title="g/gijjhakuuta.htm">Gijjhakūta</a> and stated before him his view that whoever starts 
abusive talk of another, without being able to make good his case, is 
blameworthy. The Buddha agrees and says that Upaka himself has been guilty of 
this offence. The Commentary (AA.ii.554) explains that Upaka was a supporter of 
<a href="devadatta.htm" title="d/devadatta.htm">Devadatta</a>. Upaka protests against being caught in a big noose of words, like a 
fish caught as soon as he pops up his head. The Buddha explains that it is 
necessary for him to teach with endless variations of words and similes. Upaka 
is pleased with the Buddha’s talk and reports the conversation to 
<a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>. 
The king shows his anger at the man’s presumption in having remonstrated with 
the Buddha (A.ii.181f), and the Commentary adds that he had him seized by the 
neck and cast out.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.554-5) that 
Upaka went to visit the Buddha in order to find out whether the Buddha would 
blame him for being a supporter of Devadatta. According to others, he came to 
abuse the Buddha because he had heard that the Buddha had consigned Devadatta to 
hell. He was apparently of low caste, and <a href="ajatasattu.htm" title="am/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a> addresses him as 
“salt-worker’s boy” (lonakārakadāraka) (A.ii.182).</p>
