<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as the son 
of <a href="dhananjaya.htm#Koravya" title="d/dhananjaya.htm#Koravya">Dhanañjaya</a>, king of the Kurūs, and, after his father’s death, reigned in 
<a href="indapatta.htm" title="i_/indapatta.htm">Indapatta</a>. He observed the Kurudhamma — that is to say, the pañcasīla — as did 
the queen-mother, his queen-consort, the viceroy, the chaplain, the king’s 
driver, his charioteer, the treasurer, the keeper of the royal granaries, the 
palace porter and the courtesan of the city. The country thus became very 
prosperous and its people happy. In the kingdom of Kalinga there was a drought 
and consequent scarcity of food. The king, acting on the advice of his 
ministers, sent brahmins to beg from the Bodhisatta the loan of his state 
elephant, Añjanavasabha, who was reported to bring rain. The elephant was lent 
willingly but no rain fell. It was thereupon decided that the prosperity of the 
Kurus was due to the Kurudhamma observed by the king and the others, and 
messengers were despatched to find out which these Kurudhammas were. From the 
king down to the courtesan, all had rigorously kept them, but each had 
unwittingly done something which he or she considered a violation of the dhamma. 
The messengers, therefore, had to visit each one and take down a list of the 
dhamma. The incidents related by each to the messengers, explaining wherein they 
had transgressed the dhammas, only served to emphasise how scrupulously they had 
conducted themselves.</p>
<p>The Kalinga king practised the 
Kurudhamma and rain fell in his country.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who had killed a wild goose. Two monks bathed in Aciravatī, and while 
standing on the bank, drying, they saw two geese appear. The monks took a bet as 
to which should hit the goose in the eye, and one of them threw a stone which 
pierced one eye and came out of the other. The monk was reported to the Buddha.
