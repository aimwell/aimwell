  <h2>Gilāyana Sutta</h2>

<p>As he is about to leave the Nigrodhārāma 
in Kapilavatthu to start on a tour, the Buddha is visited by Mahānāma, who asks 
him how a sick lay-disciple should be admonished. The Buddha answers that he 
should be asked to take comfort in his loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the 
Sangha, and in his possession of the Ariyan virtues. He should be shown the 
futility of longing for parents, children and sensual pleasures, and should be 
persuaded, if possible, to aspire not after rebirth, but after emancipation. 
S.v.408f.</p>
