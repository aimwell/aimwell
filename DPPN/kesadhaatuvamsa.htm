  </li>
</ul>
<p>A book containing the history of the 
Buddha’s Hair Relic. The Relic was brought to Ceylon from India by Silākāla in 
the reign of Moggallāna I. The king placed it in a crystal casket in a beautiful 
building with a picture of Dīpankara’s city (?) and established a festival in 
its honour. Silākāla was appointed custodian of the Relic (Cv.xxxix.49ff).</p>
<p>
The Kesadhātuvamsa is not now available. It was evidently easily obtainable at 
the time of the writing of the first part of the Cūlavamsa (See, e.g., 
Cv.xxxix.56). It seems to have been quite distinct from the Chakesadhātuvamsa 
(q.v.). </p>
