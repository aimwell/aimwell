  <h2>Bhāradvāja Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Udena visits Pindola Bhāradvāja at the Ghositārāma and 
asks how it is that young men in their prime should leave the world and yet live 
to the full the righteous life. Pindola answers that these young men regard all 
women as mothers, sisters, or daughters. They regard the body as full of 
manifold impurities, and abide watchful over the doors of the senses. Udena is 
pleased with the explanation and accepts the Buddha’s teaching. S.iv.110f.</p>
