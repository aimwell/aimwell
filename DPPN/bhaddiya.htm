<p><b><a name="1">1</a>. Bhaddiya Thera</b>. An anāgāmī, one of seven 
  persons who became arahants as soon as they were born in Avihā. S.i.35, 60; 
  ThigA. 222, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="2">2</a>. Bhaddiya Thera. </b>Called Kāligodhāputta, chief among monks of aristocratic 
birth (uccakulikānam) (A.i.23). He belonged to a family of the Sākyan rājas of 
Kapilavatthu and entered the Order in the Anupiya Mango grove with Anuruddha and 
the others, soon afterwards attaining to arahantship. Dwelling in the bliss of 
Nibbāna, under a tree in a lonely spot, Bhaddiya used to exclaim “Aho sukham, 
aho sukham.” When this was reported to the Buddha, he questioned Bhaddiya, who 
answered that when he was ruling his principality he was well protected, yet was 
ever fearful and nervous, whereas now, having renounced all, he was free from 
all fear (Thag.vss.842-65; UdA.ii.10; Vin.i.183f.; 
J.i.140). This incident was the occasion for the preaching of the Sukhavihārī 
Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
<p>Bhaddiya was the son of Kāligodhā, the senior Sākyan lady 
of her time. For five hundred births Bhaddiya had been king, hence his eminence 
in this life, though there were others more aristocratic (AA.i.109). His resolve 
to gain this distinction was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he 
was born in a very rich family and did various good deeds towards that end. In 
the interval between Kassapa Buddha and Gotama Buddha, he was a householder of 
Benares and, discovering that Pacceka Buddhas took their meals on the banks of 
the Ganges, placed seven stone planks for them to sit on (ThagA.ii.55f.; 
Ap.i.95f). When Bhaddiya was ruling his Sākyan principality he had as general 
Sona Potiriyaputta, who later joined the Order (ThagA.i.316). Anuruddha was 
Bhaddiya’s great friend, and when Anuruddha wished to renounce the world, his 
mother agreed only on condition that Bhaddiya should accompany him, hoping, in 
this way, to hold him back. But Anuruddha overcame all Bhaddiya’s objections and 
persuaded him to renounce the household life within a week. </p>
<p>It is said (Vin.ii.182f) that Bhaddiya attained 
arahantship in the first rainy season after his ordination.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="3">3</a>. Bhaddiya. </b>A city in the <a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Anga</a> kingdom (DhA.i.384; also iii.363). </p>
<p>The Buddha visited there several times and stayed 
sometimes at the <a href="jaatiyaavana.htm" title="j/jaatiyaavana.htm">Jātiyāvana</a> where 
<a href="mendaka.htm" title="me_mu/mendaka.htm">Mendaka</a>, who lived there, came to see 
him (Vin.ii.242; DhA.iii.363; also A.iii.36). </p>
<p>It was there that the precept was laid down forbidding 
monks to wear sandals. Vin.i.190; DhA.iii.451f.; also another ruling re the 
Pārājikā (Vin.iii.37f). </p>
<p>Bhaddiya was also the residence of <a href="bhaddaji_th.htm" title="b/bhaddaji_th.htm">Bhaddaji Thera</a> and 
<a href="visaakhaa.htm" title="vy/visaakhaa.htm">Visākhā</a>. v.l. 
Bhaddika. </p>
<p>J.ii.331, etc.; Dvy.123ff calls it Bhadrankara.</p>

<p><b><a name="6">6</a>. Bhaddiya.</b> One of the four chief merchants of 
  Ekarāja, king of Pupphavatī (Benares). J.vi.135.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><a name="7">7</a>. Bhaddiya. </b>A Licchavi who visited the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and 
asked if it were true that the Buddha was a magician who, by a glamorous trick, 
enticed away the followers of others. The Buddha advised Bhaddiya not to be led 
away by hearsay but to judge for himself; and he then proceeded, by means of 
question and answer, to convince Bhaddiya that his teachings were truly founded 
on fact and, if accepted and practised, would benefit not only human beings but 
the very trees of the forest (A.ii.190ff).</p>
<p>The Commentary adds (AA.ii.558) that, at the conclusion of 
the discourse, Bhaddiya became a sotāpanna.</p>
