<p><b>1. Cakkavatti Sutta</b> (also called 
Pacetana Sutta). There was once a king called Pacetana who asked his wheelwright 
to make a pair of wheels for a battle which was to take place six months later. 
When but six days remained of this period, only one wheel had been made, but the 
other was finished within the stipulated time. Pacetana thought that both wheels 
were alike, but the wheelwright proved to him that the one he had made hurriedly 
was faulty in various ways, owing to the crookedness of its parts. The Buddha 
identified himself with the wheelwright and declared that one must be free from 
all crookedness in order not to fall away from the Dhamma and the Vinaya. 
A.i.109f. </p>

<p><b>2. Cakkavatti Sutta.</b>-With the 
appearance of a Cakkavatti there appear seven treasures in the world; similarly, 
with the appearance of a Tathāgata there appear the seven treasures of wisdom — 
mindfulness, searching of the Dhamma, energy, zest, tranquillity, concentration, 
equanimity. S.v.99. It was also evidently called Ratana Sutta. See DA.i.250.</p>
