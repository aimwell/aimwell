<p>There was once a cripple in Benares adept in throwing 
stones. He lived at the city gate, under a banyan tree, and cut the leaves of 
the tree into different shapes for children who gave him some of their food. One 
day, the king discovered his skill and engaged his services to throw a pint pot 
of goat’s dung into the mouth of a brahmin who never stopped talking. The 
cripple sat behind a curtain through which he threw the pellets of dung as the 
brahmin talked. Then the king told the brahmin, and he was cured of his talking 
and the cripple won great wealth. Desiring gain, a certain man ministered to the 
cripple and learnt his art, and, when he left, the cripple warned him not to 
throw stones at anyone who had father or mother or owner. While wandering about, 
the man came across the Pacceka Buddha Sunetta, and, thinking him a fit victim, 
threw a stone through his ear. The Pacceka Buddha suffered great pain and died. 
When it was discovered, the man was killed and was reborn in Avīci. Later he 
became a pets, on Gijjhakūta and Moggallāna saw him going through the air, while 
sixty thousand blazing hammers rose and fell on his head. Pv.iv.16; PvA.282 6; 
DhA.ii.68 ff; cf. J.i.418f. (Sālittaka Jātaka).</p>
