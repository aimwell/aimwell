<p>A brahmin of Sāvatthi who was so delighted with the 
preaching of the Buddha that he gave meals regularly at his house to sixteen 
monks, always addressing them as “Arahant.” This displeased both the Arahants 
and the non Arahants, and they ceased going there. When the Buddha heard of it, 
he admonished the monks. DhA.iv.138f.</p>
