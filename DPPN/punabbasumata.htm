<p>A Yakkhinī, mother of Punabbasu. One evening towards 
sunset, when the Buddha was at Jetavana, she, with her daughter Uttarā on her 
hip and the boy’s hand in hers, came to the grove in search of food. She saw the 
silent monks seated round the Buddha while he preached, and having hushed her 
babe to silence she and Punabbasu listened to the Buddha. At the end of the 
sermon, both mother and son became sotāpannas, Uttarā being too young to 
understand (S.i.210f.; SA.i.239f).</p>
<p>Punabbasumātā is quoted as an example of a Yakkhinī who 
could travel through the air (PSA.79). </p>
<p>She was a vemānikapeta. DA.ii.50.</p>
