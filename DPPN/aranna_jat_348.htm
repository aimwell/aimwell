<p>The Bodhisatta was once born in a 
brahmin family. He learned all the arts in Takkasilā, but when his wife died he 
went with his son to be an ascetic in the Himālaya. One day a girl came to the 
hermitage, fleeing from brigands, and corrupted the virtue of the youth. But 
when she tried to induce him to go away with her, he wished to consult his 
father. The father warned him against leaving the hermitage and taught him the 
way to mystic meditation (J.iii.147-9). </p>
<p>The reason for telling the story is 
given in the Culla-Nāradakassapa Jātaka.</p>
