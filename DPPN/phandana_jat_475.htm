  <h2>Phandana Jātaka (No. 475)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A lion acquired the habit of going to lie under a phandana 
tree, but one day a branch fell on his shoulder and hurt him. The lion thereupon 
conceived an enmity against the tree, and when a carpenter came in search of 
wood for a cartwheel, suggested to him that he should cut down that very tree as 
the wood would be excellent for his purpose. The deity of the tree, discovering 
this, appeared before the carpenter and told him that if he placed four inches 
of the hide of a lion on the rim of his wheel its value would be greatly 
enhanced.  </p>
<p>The carpenter, adopting both suggestions, killed the lion and cut down 
the tree (J.iv.207ff). This was one of the stories related by the Buddha in the 
course of the quarrel between the Sākiyans and the Koliyans. SNA.i.358.</p>
