<p>According to the Anguttara Commentary 
(AA.i.52), there was once a period of great disaster in Ceylon, known as the 
Canndāla-tissabhaya. There was no food to be had, and Sakka provided the monks 
with a raft on which to cross the sea. Sixty monks, however, remained in Ceylon, 
guarding the scriptures. Twelve years later, when the danger was past, the monks 
who had left the land returned and dwelt in the Mandalārāma in Kallagāma (Kālakagāma?). 
There the two parties of monks met and, on comparing their records of the 
scriptures, these were found not to differ by so much as a syllable or even a 
single letter.</p>
<p>Comparison of this story with the 
account given elsewhere (E.g., VibhA.445ff) of the Brāhmanatissacorabhaya 
strongly suggests that both refer to the same account. For details see s.v. 
Brāhmanatissa.</p>
