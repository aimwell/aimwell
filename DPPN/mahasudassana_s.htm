<p>Preached between the twin Sāla trees in <a href="upavatta.htm" title="u/upavatta.htm">Upavattana</a>, the 
grove of the Mallas. Ānanda asks the Buddha not to die in the “little wattle and 
daub” town of <a href="kusinaaraa.htm" title="ku/kusinaaraa.htm">Kusināra</a>, but in some important city, such as 
<a href="campaa.htm" title="c/campaa.htm">Campā</a>, <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> or 
<a href="saavatthi.htm" title="sa/saavatthi.htm">Sāvatthi</a>. The Buddha tells him that Kusinārā was once Kusāvatī, the royal city 
of King Mahāsudassana, and was surrounded by seven ramparts, a city containing 
all the characteristics of a great capital.</p>
<p>Mahāsudassana possessed the seven treasures of a 
<a href="cakkavatti.htm" title="c/cakkavatti.htm">Cakkavatti</a>:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="cakkaratana.htm" title="c/cakkaratana.htm">cakka ratana</a>, </li>
  <li>the hatthi ratana (named <a href="uposatha.htm" title="u/uposatha.htm">Uposatha</a>), </li>
  <li>the assa ratana (named <a href="valaahaka.htm" title="va/valaahaka.htm">Valāhaka</a>), </li>
  <li>the mani ratana, </li>
  <li>the itthi ratana (pearl among 
women), </li>
  <li>the gahapati ratana, and </li>
  <li>the parināyaka ratana. </li>
</ul>
<p>He also possessed four 
iddhi powers: he was handsome, long lived, free from disease, and beloved by all 
classes of people. He had lotus ponds made all over his kingdom, food and 
clothing being placed on their banks for any who might require them. With the 
money brought to the king by the people, Vissakamma, under Sakka’s orders, built 
the Dhammapāsāda Palace, filled with all splendor and luxury. The king possessed 
a gabled hall called Mahāvyūha, where he spent the hot part of the day. In front 
of the Dhammapāsāda was the Dhammapokkharanī.</p>
<p>Having realized that his power and glory were the result 
of past good deeds, Mahāsudassana practiced generosity, self conquest and 
self-control, and developed the four jhānas, suffusing all quarters with 
thoughts of love and pity and sympathy and equanimity.</p>
<p>Mahāsudassana had eighty four thousand cities, the chief 
of which was Kusāvatī; eighty four thousand palaces, the chief being 
Dhammapāsāda; eighty four thousand gabled houses, the chief being Mahāvyūha; 
eighty four thousand state elephants, led by Uposatha; and eighty four thousand 
horses, led by Valāhaka. He had eighty four thousand chariots led by Vejayanta, 
and eighty four thousand wives, of whom Subbaddā was the chief. One day, the 
king realized that his death was approaching, and, when Subhaddā visited him to 
try and induce him to enjoy his pleasures, he stopped her, telling her to speak 
to him of the impermanence of things and the need for giving up all desire. 
While she talked to him of these things, he died and was reborn in the Brahma 
world. For eighty four thousand years be bad been a prince, a viceroy and a king 
respectively, and later, for forty eight thousand years, a devout layman in the 
Dhammapāsāda. Mahāsudassana is identified with the Buddha (D.ii.169 99; the 
story is also referred to at S.iii.144).</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sudassana had been a 
forester. He met a monk in the forest and built a hut for him. He also requested 
the monk to receive alms every day at his house or, at least, to eat there. The 
monk agreed, and Sudassana made his hut comfortable in every way, constructing 
walks, bathing places, gardens, etc., outside. He also gave him innumerable 
gifts, of various kinds and descriptions. DA.ii.631f.</p>
