<p><b>1. Mittāmitta Jātaka </b>(No. 197). The Bodhisatta was 
once the leader of a band of ascetics, and one of these, disregarding the advice 
of the Bodhisatta, adopted a young elephant whose dam was dead. The elephant 
grew up and slew its master.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a monk who took a piece 
of cloth belonging to his teacher and made with it a shoe bag, feeling sure that 
his teacher would not mind. The latter, however, flew into a rage and struck 
him. J.ii.130ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Mittāmitta Jātaka </b>(No. 473). The Bodhisatta was 
once the minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. At that time the other 
ministers were slandering a certain courtier who was upright. The king consulted 
the Bodhisatta, who pointed out to him the marks of a friend as opposed to those 
of a foe.</p>
<p>The story was told to the king of Kosala, who consulted 
the Buddha on a similar matter. J.iv.496ff.</p>
