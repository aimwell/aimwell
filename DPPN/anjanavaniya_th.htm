<p>Son of a rājā in <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, in the Vajjian 
territory. At that time Vesāli was faced by the threefold terror of drought, 
disease and demons. The Buddha quelled the panic by preaching the 
<a href="ratana_sutta.htm" title="r/ratana_sutta.htm">Ratana Sutta</a>. 
In the great concourse of listeners was the rājā’s son who thereupon left the 
world. He dwelt in the <a href="anjana_vana.htm" title="ay/anjana_vana.htm">Añjana-vana</a>, and in the 
rainy season, having procured an old couch, he put it on four stones and covered 
it all round with grass, leaving an open space to serve as door; there he spent 
his time meditating till he became an arahant (Thag.v.55; ThagA.i.127f).</p>
<p>In a previous birth he was a 
garland-maker, named Sudassana, and gave flowers to Padumuttara Buddha. He was 
sixteen times born as a king, named Devuttara.</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with 
Mutthipupphiya of the Apadāna (i.142).</p>
