<p>1. Junha.-An Elder of Kosala. For his 
story see the Māluta Jātaka (J.i.165f).</p>
<p>2. Junha.-Son of Brahmadatta, king of 
Benares. He was the Bodhisatta. See the Junha Jātaka. J.iv.95ff.</p>
<p>3. Junha.-A minister of Pasenadi. When 
Pasenadi held his Asadisadāna, Junha rejoiced in the king’s generosity, but his 
friend Kāla was displeased at what he considered as waste. The king, hearing of 
this from the Buddha, asked Junha to use the royal revenue to give alms on his 
own account during seven days. This Junha did. He became a Sotāpanna after 
hearing the Buddha preach. DhA.iii.186ff.</p>
