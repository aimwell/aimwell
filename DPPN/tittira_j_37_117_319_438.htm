<p><b>1. Tittira Jātaka (No.37).</b>-There were 
once three friends, a partridge (tittira), a monkey and an elephant. Discovering 
that the partridge was the oldest of them, they honoured him as their teacher 
and he gave them counsel. Their conduct came to be called the 
Tittiriya-brahmacariya. The Bodhisatta was the partridge, Moggallāna the 
elephant, and Sāriputta the monkey. </p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the failure of the Chabbaggiyas to show due respect to Sāriputta. Once, when he 
visited them in company with the Buddha, they refused to provide him with 
lodging, and he had to sleep under a tree. J.i.217ff; cp. Vin.ii.161; Avadāna 
S.ii.17.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Tittira Jātaka (No.117).</b>-The 
Bodhisatta was once a leader of five hundred ascetics. One day, a talkative 
ascetic approached a jaundiced colleague who was chopping wood and worried him 
by giving him directions on how to do it. The ill man killed him with one blow 
of the axe. Soon after, a partridge, who used to sing on an anthill near by, was 
killed by a fowler. The Bodhisatta pointed out to his followers how the death of 
both was due to their talking too much.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Kokalika, who is identified with the chattering ascetic. J.i.431f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Tittira Jātaka (No.319).</b>-Once the 
Bodhisatta was a brahmin ascetic, and Rāhula a decoy partridge used by a village 
fowler. When the partridge uttered a cry, other partridges would flock to him, 
and they were killed by the fowler. The partridge was filled with remorse, 
fearing that he was doing wrong. One day he met the Bodhisatta who set his 
doubts at rest. </p>
<p>The story was told in reference to 
Rāhula’s readiness to profit by instruction (J.iii.64ff). It was related by 
Moggaliputta-Tissa to Asoka, to prove to him that an action becomes a crime only 
when performed with bad intention. Mhv.v.264.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Tittira Jātaka (No.438).</b>-Once in 
Benares was a famous teacher who retired into the forest. Men came from all 
parts to learn from him and brought him many presents. He had in his house a 
tame partridge, who, by listening to the teacher’s exposition, learnt the three 
Vedas by heart. A tame lizard and a cow were given as presents to the teacher. 
When the teacher died, his students were in despair, but were reassured by the 
partridge who taught them what he knew. One day a wicked ascetic came to the 
hermitage and, in the absence of the students, killed the partridge, the young 
lizard and the cow. The partridge had two friends, a lion and a tiger, who 
killed the murderer.</p>
<p>The ascetic was Devadatta, the lizard 
Kisāgotamī, the tiger Moggallāna, the lion Sāriputta, the teacher Mahā Kassapa, 
and the partridge the Bodhisatta. </p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha. J.iii.536f.</p>
