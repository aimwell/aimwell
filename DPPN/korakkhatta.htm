  <h2>Korakkhatta (Korakkhattiya)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A naked ascetic in Uttarakā. He bellowed 
like a dog, walked on all fours, and licked up food with his mouth only. 
Sunakkhatta saw him and greatly admired him, but the Buddha prophesied that 
Korakkhatta would, in seven days, die of epilepsy and be born among the 
Kālakañjakas.  </p>
<p>The prophecy proved true, and Sunakkhatta learnt the truth from 
Korakkhatta’s corpse (D.iii.6ff; J.i.389f).  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.819) that Korakkhattiya was so called because his feet turned inwards (anto vankapādo).</p>
