<p>A brahmin. He once visited the Buddha at 
Sāvatthi and asked him whether the five sense-faculties (indriyāni), which were 
of different scope and range, had any common ground of resort (pati-sarana). The 
Buddha replies that the mind is their common resort and, in answer to further 
questions, explains that there is nothing beyond Nibbāna; that the holy life has 
Nibbāna for its ending.</p>
<p>When the brahmin, greatly pleased with 
the Buddha’s teaching, goes away, the Buddha tells the monks that Unnābha has 
become an anāgāmī and would, therefore, after death, no longer return to this 
world (S.v.217f).</p>
<p>The same Nikāya (S.v.272f) records a 
visit of Unnābha to Ānanda at Kosambī. He asks Ānanda what is the aim of holy 
life and, on being told that it is the abandoning of desire by means of jhāna, 
suggests that it would be a task without end. But Ānanda, by means of an 
illustration, explains how the task does come to an end, and Unnābha expresses 
great satisfaction with the answer. Perhaps this refers to another brahmin of 
the same name.</p>
