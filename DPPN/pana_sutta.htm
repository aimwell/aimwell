<h4>1. Pānā Sutta</h4>
<p>Just as whatsoever creatures adopt the four postares do so 
in dependence on the earth, so does a monk develop the seven bojjhangas, 
dependent on virtue. S.v.78.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Pānā Sutta</h4>
<p>Supposing a man were to collect all the grass, sticks, 
etc., in Jambudīpa, and after making sticks of various sizes were to impale on 
them all the creatures of the ocean, creatures of all sizes, even so a majority 
of the minute animals would remain free, being too small to be impaled. Even 
thus widespread is the ruin of things, yet from such widespread ruin will be 
saved those who have the gift of realizing the Four Noble Truths. S.v.441.</p>
