<p>The story of a man who was engaged by a 
pious man of Rājagaha to guard his gate.</p>
<p>The gate had to be kept shut for fear of 
thieves and, as a result, monks had often to go away without receiving any alms.
</p>
<p>A man was therefore engaged to see that 
the monks' needs were satisfied. </p>
<p>The gate-keeper was born after death in 
Tāvatimsa. Vv.v.5; VvA.246f.</p>
