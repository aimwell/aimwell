<p>King of Magadha and father of Kālāsoka. He reigned for 
eighteen years (Mhv.iv.6; but see Dpv.v.98, where his reign is given as ten 
years, in the eighth year of which Dasaka Thera died. Cf. Sp.i.33.). </p>
<p>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (M.T.155f), he was the son 
of a Licchavi rājā and a courtezan. When he was born he looked like a lump of 
flesh, and his mother gave orders that he should be put in a vessel and cast on 
the rubbish heap. The Nāga-king of the city kept guard over the vessel, but when 
the people crowded round him and said “Su-sū,” he left it and went away. In the 
crowd was a minister’s son, and, when the vessel was opened and the child was 
discovered, he decided to adopt him. In due course the child grew up, and when 
the infuriated populace deposed the parricide Nāgadāsaka, they placed Susunāga 
on the throne. He was called Susunāga because he was guarded by the Nāga who 
disappeared when the people said “Su-sū.”</p>
