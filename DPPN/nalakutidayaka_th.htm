<p>An arahant. Thirty one kappas ago he built a house of 
reeds near Bhārika (Hārita) in Himāva, for the Pacceka Buddha Nārada, thatched 
it with reeds and made a covered walk near by. When he was born in Tāvatimsa he 
had a palace sixty leagues in extent (Ap.ii.440). He is probably identical with 
Valliya Thera (ThagA.i.247). The same verses are attributed to Nalagārika (see 
below).</p>
