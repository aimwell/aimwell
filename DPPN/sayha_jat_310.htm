  <h2>Sayha Jātaka (No. 310)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta was once the son of the chaplain of 
Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was brought up with the king’s son, and they 
studied together in Takkasilā, becoming great friends. When the prince succeeded 
to the throne, the Bodhisatta, not desiring to live a householder’s life, became 
an ascetic and lived in the Himālaya. As time passed, the king began to think of 
him, and sent his minister, Sayha, to fetch the ascetic, that he might become 
the royal chaplain. But the Bodhisatta refused to come, saying that he had no 
need of such honour.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who, loving a 
woman, was discontented. The king is identified with Ānanda, and Sayha with 
Sāriputta. J.iii.30 33.</p>
