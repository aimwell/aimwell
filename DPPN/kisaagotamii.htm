<p>1. Kisāgotamī Therī.-An arahant. She was 
declared chief among women disciples with respect to the wearing of coarse robes 
(lūkhacīvara-dharānam) (A.i.25; the DhA.iv.156 contains a story of the Buddha 
speaking to Sakka the praises of Kisāgotamī). She came from a poor family in 
Sāvatthi (of a setthikula, which had fallen on evil days, says the Apadāna 
p.565, vs.19). Gotamī was her name — she was called Kisā because of her 
thinness. She was married into a rich family, by whom she was disdainfully 
treated; but as soon as she bore a son she was shown respect. </p>
<p>(Except by her husband says the Apadāna 
loc. cit.20. The DhA.ii.270ff account, however, makes no mention of her ill 
treatment; on the contrary, it leads us to expect that she should have been 
greatly esteemed because, prior to her arrival, her father-in-law’s wealth, 
forty crores in amount, had all turned into charcoal. When she touched the 
charcoal it once more became gold. This account is found also in SA.i.149).</p>
<p>The boy, however, died when just old 
enough to run about; his mother, distraught with grief, fearful lest the dead 
child should be taken from her, went about with him on her hip, seeking medicine 
to revive his life. People laughed at her, until one wise man, realizing her 
condition, directed her to the Buddha. The Buddha asked her to bring him a 
mustard seed from a house where no one had yet died. In the course of her search 
for the impossible her frenzy left her, and having grasped the truth, she laid 
the child in the charnel field, and returning to the Master begged admission to 
the Order. She became a Sotāpanna, and soon after, when her insight was 
developed, the Buddha appeared before her in a blaze of radiance and, listening 
to his words, she became an arahant. (ThigA.174ff; Ap.ii.564f; DhA.i.270ff; 
AA.i.205).</p>
<p>In the verses ascribed to her in the 
Therīgāthā (vv.213-23), she incorporates the story of Patācārā in her own psalm, 
as though to utter more fully the pageant and tragedy inherent in woman’s lot, 
whereof her own sorrow was but a phase.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she 
was a householder’s daughter in Hamsavatī, and having heard the Buddha assign to 
a bhikkhunī the foremost rank among wearers of coarse robes, she vowed that one 
day the same rank should be her’s.</p>
<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was 
the fifth daughter of Kikī and her name was Dhammā. Then she entered the Order 
and lived a celibate life (Ap.ii.564f; ThigA.190f). She is identified with the 
lizard in the Tittira Jātaka (J.iii.543).</p>
<p>The Samyutta Nikāya (i.129f) records a 
visit paid to her by Māra as she sat resting in Andhavana. He was forced to 
retire discomfited.</p>
<p>2. Kisāgotamī.-A Khattiya-maiden of 
Kapilavatthu. She saw from her balcony Siddhattha Gotama returning in his 
chariot to his palace on receipt of the news that a son had been born to him. 
Gotamī was gladdened by the sight of him, and gave vent to her exultation in the 
famous “nibbutā-pada” (nibuttā nūna sā mātā, etc.).</p>
<p>Gotama was pleased by the mention of the 
word nibbuta, which to him meant deliverance, and as a mark of his gratitude 
sent her the necklace of pearls which he wore, worth one hundred thousand. She 
accepted it gladly as a token of his love (J.i.60f; BuA.232f). She is sometimes 
spoken of as a cousin of Gotama, his father’s brother’s daughter (pitucchādhītā). 
(E.g., DhA.i.70; DhSA.34. A parallel has been drawn between this story and that 
of Luke xi.27).</p>
<p>3. Kisāgotamī.-Wife of the Buddha Phussa 
in his last lay life. Their son was Ānanda. Bu.xix.16.</p>
<p>4. Kisāgotamī.-One of the chief women 
supporters of the Buddha Tissa. Bu.xviii.23.</p>
