  <h2>Pāricchattaka Vimāna Vatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once a pious follower of the Buddha, living at Sāvatthi, 
invited the Buddha to a meal and showed him great honour. A woman who had gone 
to Andhavana to gather firewood picked some asoka flowers on the way, and, 
passing the Buddha, gave them to him and worshipped him. She was born after 
death in Tāvatima and questioned by Moggallāna. Vv.iii.10; VvA.172ff.</p>
