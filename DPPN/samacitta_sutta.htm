  <h2>Samacitta(pariyāya) Sutta</h2>

<p>A large number of Devas of Tranquil Mind (Samacittā) come 
to the Buddha at Jetavana and ask him if he will visit Sāriputta, who is 
preaching at the Migāramātupāsāda on the person who is fettered both inwardly 
and outwardly. The Buddha agrees in silence and appears at the Migāramātupāsāda. 
Sāriputta greets the Buddha and salutes him. The Buddha relates to him the visit 
of the Devas and tells him that a large number of them can stand in a space not 
greater than the point of a gimlet, and that, too, without crowding each other. 
This is because they have trained themselves to be tranquil in the senses and in 
the mind. Such tranquillity leads to tranquillity also of body, speech, and 
thought. Followers of other schools do not know this teaching (A.i.64f).</p>
<p>In the discourse of Sāriputta, (A.i.62f) referred to by 
the Devas, the Elder explains that the monk who keeps the Pātimokkha restraints 
is proficient in the practice of right conduct, seeing danger in the slightest 
faults such a one is reborn among the Devas and is therefore a “Returner.” Thus 
he is fettered inwardly to the self. Others there are who are born in Deva 
worlds and there become anāgāmīs. These are fettered outwardly. Yet others are 
proficient in revulsion, in the ending of sensuality, of any existence and 
become anāgāmīs.</p>
<p>It is said (AA.i.320; cf. SNA., p.174; Mil. p.20) that at 
the conclusion of this sutta, as at the conclusion of the Mahāsamaya, Mangala, 
and Cūla Rāhulovāda Suttas, one hundred thousand crores attained arahantship.</p>
<p>The sutta was preached by Mahinda on the evening of his 
arrival in Ceylon. After his interview with Devānampiyatissa, Mahinda asked 
Sumana sāmanera to announce the preaching of the Dhamma. This announcement was 
heard throughout the Island, and gradually the news of it spread to Brahmā’s 
heaven. There was then an assembly of Devas, just as on the occasion of 
Sāriputta’s preaching of the sutta. Mhv.xiv.34ff.</p>
