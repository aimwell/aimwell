<p>One of the fraternities of monks in 
Ceylon, an off-shoot of the Abhayagiri sect. Their headquarters were probably at 
the Uttarola Vihāra, built by King Mānavamma, and given to the monks of the 
Abhayagiri Vihāra, for having consented to take into the Order his elder 
brother, in spite of the fact that he had lost one eye as the result of some 
yoga practices. </p>
<p>The first chief of Uttarola was the 
king’s brother himself and he was in charge of six hundred monks. He was granted 
great honours and privileges together with five classes of servants to minister 
to him. He was also appointed to supervise the guardians of the Tooth Relic 
(Cv.lvii.7-11, and 16-26; also Geiger’s Trs.i.194, n.2 and 3). </p>
<p>From a Tamil inscription of Mānavamma we 
find that he kept up his patronage of the Uttaramūla Nikāya, and it is recorded 
that he gave over the custodianship of the Tooth Relic to a monk of this 
fraternity, named Moggallāna (Epi. Zey., vol.ii., pt. vi., pp.250ff).</p>
<p>Anuruddha, author of the Anuruddha 
Sataka and the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha, describes himself in the colophon to the 
former work as an “Upasthavira” of the Uttaramūla Nikāya.</p>
<p>In later years this Nikāya produced many 
an illustrious star in Celyon’s literary firmament, among them the grammarian 
Moggallāna, Vilgammūla, Mahā Thera and Sri Rāhula. For details about them see 
P.L.C., passim.</p>
