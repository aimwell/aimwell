</ul>
<p>Punna (of Sunāparanta) visits the Buddha and asks him for 
a teaching that he may follow it and be purged of self. The Buddha tells him to 
avoid finding delight in the pleasures of the senses.</p>
<p>On learning that Punna proposes to live in Sunāparanta, 
the Buddha warns him that the people of that part are fierce and violent. Punna 
declares that even should they kill him, he would not bear them ill will, but 
would rejoice to be of use to them. He leaves for Sunāparanta, with the Buddha’s 
approval, and there gather around him five hundred disciples of either sex who 
have won arahantship. After Punna’s death, the monks question the Buddha about 
him, and the Buddha tells them that he had realised nibbāna. M.iii.267 ff.; 
S.iv.60 ff.</p>
