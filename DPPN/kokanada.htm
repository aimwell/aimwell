<p><b>1. Kokanada.</b>-The palace of <a href="bodhi.htm" title="b/bodhi.htm">Bodhirājakumāra</a>, to which he invited the  <span lang="en-us">
<a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> </span>and the monks to a meal 
when the Buddha was staying at <a href="bhesakalavava.htm" title="b/bhesakalavava.htm">Bhesakalāvana</a>; the palace was just completed 
(Vin.ii.127; iv.199; M.ii.91). The artisan who built it was blinded, in case he 
should build another like it (J.iii.157; but see DhA.iii.134f, where it is said 
that, warned by Bodhi’s friend, <a href="sanjikaputta.htm" title="sa/sanjikaputta.htm">Sanjikāputta</a>, the builder escaped on a magic 
bird). </p>
<p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.739), 
the palace was called <a href="kokanada.htm" title="ku/kokanada.htm">Kokanada</a> (lotus), because it was built in the form of a 
hanging lotus.</p>

<p><b>2. Kokanada.</b>-A lute (vinā) given by 
Sakka to Sīlavatī, Kusa’s mother, and afterwards used by Kusa to win back 
Pabhāvatī (J.v.281, 290). It was so called either from the country of its origin 
or from its colour. See Jāt. Trs.v.143 n.</p>
