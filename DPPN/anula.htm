<p>1. Anula.-A Thera, incumbent of the 
Kotipabbatamahāvihāra in Ceylon. He evidently possessed the celestial eye and, 
seeing how Sumana, wife of Lakuntaka-atimbara, had once been a pig, he expressed 
marvel that such things should happen. She heard his exclamation, and having 
learnt from him the story of that past life, she herself got the power of seeing 
her past lives. DhA.iv.50-1.</p>

<p>2. Anula.-See Mahā Anula.</p>
