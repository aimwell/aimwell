<p><b>1. Sudinna.</b> Father of <a href="piyadassii.htm" title="pu/piyadassii.htm">Piyadassī</a> Buddha (J.i.39); 
but see <a href="sudatta.htm" title="s/sudatta.htm">Sudatta</a> (9).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sudinna Kalandakaputta.</b> A monk who, after being 
ordained, returned to his former wife and had relations with her, thus becoming 
guilty of the first Pārājikā offence. When there was a famine in the 
<a href="vajjii.htm" title="va/vajjii.htm">Vajji</a> 
country, Sudinna went to <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the 
mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he 
distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and 
asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and 
voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he 
was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There 
he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had 
already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to 
tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on 
being addressed by him as “Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his 
meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without 
worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the 
<a href="mahavana.htm" title="maha/mahavana.htm">Mahāvana</a>, and 
begged that he would give her a son, so that the <a href="licchavi.htm" title="l/licchavi.htm">Licchavis</a> might not confiscate 
their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three 
times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was 
called <a href="bijaka.htm" title="b/bijaka.htm">Bījaka</a>. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with 
remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, 
who blamed him greatly. (Vin.iii.11-21; see Sp.i.270, where Sudinna is held not 
guilty of the Pārājikā offence because he was an ādikammika.).</p>
<p>The Buddha’s censure of Sudinna forms the topic of one of 
the dilemmas of the <a href="milindapanha.htm" title="me_mu/milindapanha.htm">Milinda-Pañha</a>. (p.170f).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sudinna. </b>Evidently a famous commentator. 
Buddhaghosa quotes (DA.ii.566; AA.ii.551) him as saying that there is no word of 
the Buddha which is not a sutta (asuttam nāma kim buddhavacanam atthi ?) and 
thus rejecting the Jātaka, Patisambhidā, Niddesa, Sutta Nipāta, Dhammapada, 
Itivuttaka, Vimānavatthu, Petavatthu, Thera&nbsp; and Therī-gāthā and Apadāna.</p>
