  <h2>Vesāli</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A city, capital of the Licchavis. The Buddha first visited 
it in the fifth year after the Enlightenment, and spent the vassa there (BuA., 
p. 3). The Commentaries give detailed descriptions of the circumstances of this 
visit. KhpA.160ff.= SNA.i.278; DhA.iii.436ff.; cp. Mtu.i.253ff</p>
<p>Vesāli was inhabited by seven thousand and seven rājās, 
each of whom had large retinues, many palaces and pleasure parks. There came a 
shortage in the food supply owing to drought, and people died in large numbers. 
The smell of decaying bodies attracted evil spirits, and many inhabitants were 
attacked by intestinal disease. The people complained to the ruling prince, and 
he convoked a general assembly, where it was decided, after much discussion, to 
invite the Buddha to their city. As the Buddha was then at Veluvana in Rājagaha, 
the Licchavi Mahāli, friend of Bimbisāra and son of the chaplain of Vesāli, was 
sent to Bimbisāra with a request that he should persuade the Buddha to go to 
Vesāli. Bimbisāra referred him to the Buddha himself, who, after listening to 
Mahāli’s story, agreed to go. The Buddha started on the journey with five 
hundred monks. Bimbisāra decorated the route from Rājagaha to the Ganges, a 
distance of five leagues, and provided all comforts on the way. He accompanied 
the Buddha, and the Ganges was reached in five days. Boats, decked with great 
splendour, were ready for the Buddha and his monks, and we are told that 
Bimbisāra followed the Buddha into the water up to his neck. The Buddha was 
received on the opposite bank by the Licchavis, with even greater honour than 
Bimbisāra had shown him. As soon as the Buddha set foot in the Vajjian 
territory, there was a thunderstorm and rain fell in torrents. The distance from 
the Ganges to Vesāli was three leagues; as the Buddha approached Vesāli, Sakka 
came to greet him, and, at the sight of the devas, all the evil spirits fled in 
fear. In the evening the Buddha taught Ānanda the Ratana Sutta, and ordered that 
it should be recited within the three walls of the city, the round of the city 
being made with the Licchavi princes. This Ānanda did during the three watches 
of the night, and all the pestilences of the citizens disappeared. The Buddha 
himself recited the Ratana Sutta to the assembled people, and eighty four 
thousand beings were converted. After repeating this for seven consecutive days, 
the Buddha left Vesāli. (According to the DhA. account the Buddha stayed only 
seven days in Vesāli; KhA. says two weeks). The Licchavis accompanied him to the 
Ganges with redoubled honours, and, in the river itself, Devas and Nāgas vied 
with each other in paying him honour. On the farther bank, Bimbisāra awaited his 
arrival and conducted him back to Rājagaha. On his return there, the Buddha 
recited the <a href="sankha.htm" title="sa/sankha.htm">Sankha Jātaka</a>. (See 2.)</p>
<p>It was probably during this visit of the Buddha to Vesāli 
that Suddhodana died. (See ThigA., p. 141; AA.i.186). </p>
<p>It was during this visit of the Buddha to Kapilavatthu (tadā) 
that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī first asked his permission to join the Order, but her 
request was refused (AA.i.186).</p>
<p>According to one account, the Buddha went through the air 
to visit his dying father and to preach to him, thereby enabling him to attain 
arahantship before his death. It is not possible to know how many visits were 
paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they 
were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at 
Vesāli. See, e.g., Vin.i.238, 287f; ii.118, 119 27. The visit mentioned in the 
last context seems to have been a long one; it was on this occasion that the 
Buddha ordered the monks to turn their bowls upon the Licchavi Vaddha (q.v.). 
For other Vinaya rules laid down at Vesāli, see also Vin.ii.159f.; iii. and iv. 
passim.</p>
<p>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from 
Kapilavatthu, that <a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpatī 
Gotamī</a> followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with 
the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the 
Order under certain conditions. Vin.ii.253ff.; see
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm" title="maha/mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī</a>.</p>
<p>The books describe (E.g., D.ii.95ff) at some length the 
Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this 
visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, 
in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of 
Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the 
Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Cf. Mtu.i.300, where a Kapinayha-cetiya 
is also mentioned. All these were once shrines dedicated to various local 
deities, but after the Buddha’s visit to Vesāli, they were converted into places 
of Buddhist worship. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli&nbsp;&nbsp; 
e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.</p>
<p>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūtāgārasālā (q.v.) 
during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these 
different shrines (See D.ii.118). During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he 
decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his 
decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhandagāma, after taking one last look 
at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant” (nāgāpalokitam 
apaloketvā) (D.ii.122). The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent 
at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. 
On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the 
monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of 
the Order (D.ii.98; but see Dial.ii.102, n.1).</p>
<p>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Niganthas, and it is said 
that of the forty two rainy seasons of the latter part of Mahāvīra’s ascetic 
life, he passed twelve at Vesāli. Jacobi: Jaina Sutras (S.B.E.) Kalpa Sūtra, 
sect. 122; Vesāli was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and Pātikaputta 
(q.v.). Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special 
mention is made of Ugga (chief of those who gave pleasant gifts), Pingiyāni, 
Kāranapāli, Sīha, Vāsettha (A.iv.258), and the various Licchavis (see Licchavi.)</p>
<p>The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort 
to the Niganthas, and we find mention (See, e.g., Sīha) of various devices 
resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence 
of the Buddha.</p>
<p>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, 
rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. There were 
seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds and an equal number of 
lotus ponds. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in 
large measure in making the city prosperous (Vin.i.268). The city had three 
walls, each one gāvuta away from the other, and at three places in the walls 
were gates with watch towers. </p>
<p>J.i.604; cf.i.389. Perhaps these three walls separated the 
three districts of Vaisālī mentioned in the Tibetan Dulva (Rockhill, p.62); 
Hoernle (Uvāsagadasāo Translation ii., p.4, n.8) identifies these three 
districts with the city proper, Kundapura and Vāniyagāma, respectively mentioned 
in the Jaina books. Buddhaghosa says (e.g., Sp.ii.393) that Vesāli was so called 
because it was extensive (visālībhūtatā Vesāli ti uccati); cf. UdA.184 (tikkhattum 
visālabhūtattā); and MA.i.259. </p>
<p>Outside the town, leading uninterruptedly up to the 
Himālaya, was the Mahāvana (DA.i.309) (q.v.), a large, natural forest. Near by 
were other forests, such as Gosingalasāla. (A.v.134)</p>
<p>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, 
Mahāsīhanāda, Cūla Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and 
Ratana. </p>
<p>See also A.i.220, 276; ii.190, 200; iii.38, 49ff., 75, 
142, 167, 236, 239; iv. 16, 79, 100, 179, 208, 274ff., 279ff., 308ff.; v. 86, 
133, 342; S.i.29, 112, 230; ii.267, 280; iii.68, 116; iv. 109, 210ff., 380; v. 
141f, 152f, 258, 301, 320, 389, 453; D.ii.94ff.; the subjects of these 
discourses are mentioned passim, in their proper places; see also DhA.i.263; 
iii.267, 279, 460, 480.</p>
<p>The Telovāda Jātaka (No. 246) and the
<a href="sigala_jat_113_142_8.htm" title="s/sigala_jat_113_142_8.htm">Sigāla Jātaka</a> (No. 152) were 
preached at Vesāli. After the Buddha’s death a portion of his relics was 
enshrined in the City. (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2)</p>
<p>One hundred years later Vesāli was again the scene of 
interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the 
Vajjiputtakā, (q.v.), and the second Council held in connection with this 
dispute at the Vālikārāma.</p>
<p>The city was also called Visālā. (E.g., AA.i.47; 
Cv.xcix.98). There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā 
(D.ii.258).</p>
<p>Vesāli is identified with the present village of Basrah in 
the Muzafferpur district in Tirhut. See Vincent Smith, J.R.A.S. 1907, p. 267f., 
and Marshall, Arch. Survey of India, 1903 4, p. 74.</p>
