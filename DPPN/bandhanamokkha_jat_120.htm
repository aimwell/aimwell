<p>The Bodhisatta was once chaplain to King <b>Brahmadatta</b>. 
While the king was absent, quelling a frontier rebellion, his queen sinned with 
all the messengers sent by the king to inquire after her welfare. On the day of 
the king’s return, the chaplain, while decorating the palace, entered the 
queen’s apartments, and she asked him to satisfy her lust. When he refused the 
queen (feigning illness) charged him with having ill treated her. Thereupon the 
king ordered that the chaplain be beheaded, but the latter begged to be brought 
before the king, where he protested his innocence and proved, by the testimony 
of the king’s messengers, the queen’s wickedness. The king wished to put to 
death the queen and all the messengers, but the chaplain interceded on their 
behalf and they were pardoned. He himself retired to the Himāya, where he became 
an ascetic.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to the 
attempt of <b>Ciñcā</b> to bring calumny upon the Buddha. The queen is 
identified with Ciññcā and the king with <b>Ānanda</b>. J.i.437ff.</p>
