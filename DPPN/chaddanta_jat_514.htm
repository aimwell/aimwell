<p>The story of the Bodhisatta, born as 
Chaddanta, king of elephants. It was related in reference to a nun of Sāvatthi 
who, while listening one day to a sermon by the Buddha, admired his extreme 
beauty of form and wondered if she had ever been his wife. Immediately the 
memory of her life as Cullasubhaddā, Chaddanta’s consort, came to her mind and 
she laughed for joy; but on further recollecting that she had been the 
instrument of his death, she wept aloud. The Buddha related this story in 
explanation of her conduct. J.v.36; Speyer (ZDMG.lxxv.2, 305ff) suggests an 
allegorical explanation of the Chaddanta Jātaka. Feer (JA.1895 v.) gives a 
careful study of the story based on a comparison of five different Versions — 
two Pāli, two Chinese and one Sanskrit. This Jātaka forms the theme of many 
illustrations — e.g., in Barhut (Cunningham, pl.xxxvi.6), also Ajanta Caves x. 
and xvii.</p>
