<p><b>1. Sanghatissa. </b>A Lambakanna who became king of 
Ceylon (303 7 A.C.) after slaying Vijayakumāra. He set up a parasol on the Mahā 
Thūpa and did other works of merit. Having heard from the Thera Mahādeva of 
Dāmahālaka of the merits of giving rice gruel, he arranged for a regular 
distribution of it. He used to visit Pācīnadīpaka in order to eat jambu fruits 
there, and the people, annoyed by his visits, poisoned him. He was succeeded by 
Sanghabodhi. Mhv.xxxvi.58ff.; Dpv.xxii.48f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sanghatissa.</b> Called Asiggāha. He succeeded 
Aggabodhi II. as king of Ceylon (611 13 A.C.). Moggallāna (afterwards Moggallāna 
III.) rose against him, and Anurādhapura was deserted by the people. Sanghatissa 
was once forced to eat food prepared for the monks at the Mahāpāli. His Senāpati 
proved treacherous, the king was defeated in battle and was forced to flee to 
Merumajjara. From there he went to Veluvana, where, at the suggestion of the 
monks, he put on yellow robes and went towards Rohana with his son and minister. 
He was, however, recognized and taken captive at Manihīra, brought to Sīhagiri, 
and beheaded at the command of Moggallāna. His son asked to be beheaded before 
him, and his request was granted; his minister was also beheaded, because he 
refused to leave his king. Sanghatissa had another son, Jetthatissa.
