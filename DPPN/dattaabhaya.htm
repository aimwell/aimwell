</ul>
<p>A monk, elder brother of the 
Catunikāyika Thera of Kolitavihāra. Abhaya lived in Potaliya-vihāra and once, 
when ill, sent for his brother and asked for a formula of meditation easy to 
practise. The latter suggested meditation on food, and Dattābhaya became an 
arahant (AA.i.343). He is described as strong in appetites and dislikes, but 
intelligent and keen in understanding. MA.ii.527; DhSA.268.</p>
