<p>King of Benares. He loved dancing, and had three houses in 
which young, middle aged, and old women danced respectively. One day he passed 
from one house to the other, and though the dancers put forth all their skill, 
the king failed to find satisfaction. Realizing that this discontent was the 
result of his craving, he left the world, developed insight, and became a 
Pacceka Buddha. His verse is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta. SN.vs.61; 
SNA.i.113f.; ApA.i.158.</p>
