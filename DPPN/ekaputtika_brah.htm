<p>King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>. He had only one son, of 
whom he was extremely fond. One day when the king was enjoying himself in the 
royal park, the boy was suddenly taken ill and died at once. Lest the king 
should die of a broken heart, the ministers did not tell him for two days. The 
king thereupon reflected on the nature of death and developing insight became a 
Pacceka Buddha. </p>
<p>His verse is included in the 
KhaggavisƒÅna Sutta. Sn.v.41; SnA.i.85f; ApA.i.138.</p>
