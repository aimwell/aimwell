<h2><b>Sañjaya Belatthiputta</b></h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the six famous 
heretical teachers of the Buddha’s day. He was a great skeptic, his teaching 
being the evasion of problems and the suspension of judgment. His doctrines seem 
to have been identical with those of the Amarāvikkhepikas (Eel wrigglers) who, 
when asked a question, would equivocate and wriggle like an eel. Sañjaya’s 
teachings are given at D.i.58; cf. the “Eel wrigglers” at D.i.27.</p>
<p>It is probable that Sañjaya suspended his judgments only 
with regard to those questions the answers to which must always remain a matter 
of speculation. It may be that he wished to impress on his followers the fact 
that the final answer to these questions lay beyond the domain of speculation, 
and that he wished to divert their attention from fruitless enquiry and direct 
it towards the preservation of mental equanimity.  </p>
<p>Buddhaghosa gives us no 
particulars about Sañjaya, beyond the fact that he was the son of Belattha 
(DA.i.144). Sanskrit texts call him Sañjayī Vairatiputra (E.g., Mtu.iii.59f) and 
Sañjayi Vairattīputra (E.g., Dvy. 143,145).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Sañjaya the 
<a href="paribbajaka.htm" title="pa/paribbajaka.htm">Paribbājaka</a> who 
was the original teacher of <a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> (Vin.i.39). It is said that 
when these two disciples left Sañjaya to become pupils of the Buddha, they were 
joined by two hundred and fifty others. Sañjaya then fainted, and hot blood 
issued from his mouth. Vin.i.42; according to DhA.i.78, Sāriputta and Moggallāna 
tried to persuade Sañjaya to accept the Buddha’s doctrine, but they failed, and 
only one half of his disciples joined them. The Paribbājaka 
<a href="suppiya.htm" title="s/suppiya.htm">Suppiya</a> was 
also a follower of Sañjaya (DA.i.35).</p>
<p>Barua thinks (Op. cit., 326) that the Aviruddhakas 
mentioned in the Anguttara (A.iii.276) were also followers of Sañjaya — 
that they were called Amarāvikkhepakā for their philosophical doctrines, and 
Aviruddhakā for their moral conduct.</p>
