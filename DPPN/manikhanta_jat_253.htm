  <h2>Manikantha Jātaka (No. 253)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Bodhisatta and his younger brother, after the death of 
their parents, lived as ascetics in leaf huts on the Ganges, the elder being 
higher up the stream than the younger. One day, the Nāga king Manikantha, while 
walking along the river in the guise of a man, came to the hut of the younger 
ascetic and became his friend. Thereafter he called daily and their friendship 
grew apace. Manikantha finally became so fond of the ascetic that he put off his 
disguise, and encircling the other in his folds, lay thus for a short while each 
day, until his affection was satisfied. But the ascetic was afraid of his Nāga 
shape and grew thin and pale.</p>
<p>The Bodhisatta noticing this, suggested that the next time 
Manikantha came, his brother should ask for the jewel which he wore round his 
throat. On the morrow, when the ascetic made this request, Manikantha hurried 
away. Several times this happened, and then he came no more. The ascetic was 
much grieved by his absence, but was comforted by the Bodhisiatta.</p>
<p>The Buddha related this story at the Aggālava-cetiya 
near Alavi. The monks of Alavi became so importunate with their requests for 
building materials from the householders that at the mere sight of a monk the 
householders would hurry indoors. Mahā Kassapa discovered this and reported it 
to the Buddha, who admonished the monks against begging for things from other 
people. J.ii.282 6; also Vin.iii.146f., where the details of the story of the 
past are slightly different.</p>
<p>On the same occasion were preached the Brahmadatta Jātaka 
and the Atthisena Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
