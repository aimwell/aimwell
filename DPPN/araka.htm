<p>The Bodhisatta, born as a brahmin 
teacher. His story is told in the Araka Jātaka. He is referred to also in the 
Dhammaddhaja Jātaka (J.ii.195), where the Bodhisatta relates how, as Araka, he 
had developed thoughts of loving-kindness and practised the brahmavihārā for 
seven years and then was born in the Brahma-world.</p>
<p>His name appears again in the Anguttara 
Nikāya (A.iv.136-8) in a list of teachers, and we are told that among Araka’s 
pupils those who followed his teachings were born in the Brahma-world, while the 
others were born in various purgatories. In the Anguttara context no special 
mention is made of his having taught the brahma-vihāras.</p>
