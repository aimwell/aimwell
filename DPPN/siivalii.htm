<p><b>1. Sīvalī. </b>Daughter of Polajanaka. See the 
<a href="mahajanaka_jat_539.htm" title="maha/mahajanaka_jat_539.htm">Mahājanaka Jātaka</a>. She is identified with Rāhulamātā. J.vi.68.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sīvalī Thera.</b> He was the son of 
<a href="suppavaasaa.htm" title="s/suppavaasaa.htm">Suppavāsā</a>, 
daughter of the king of <a href="koliyaa.htm" title="ku/koliyaa.htm">Koliya</a>. For seven years and seven days he lay in her 
womb, and for seven days she was in labour and was unable to bring forth the 
child. She said to her husband: “Before I die I will make a gift,” and sent gift 
by him to the Buddha. He accepted the gift and pronounced blessing on her. She 
was immediately delivered of a son. When her husband returned, she asked him to 
show hospitality to the Buddha and his monks for seven days.</p>
<p>From the time of his birth, Sīvalī could do anything. 
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> talked with him on the day of his birth and ordained him with Suppavāsā’s permission. Sīvalī became a 
Sotāpanna in the Tonsure hall when his 
first lock of hair was cut, and a sakadāgāmī with the second. Some say that 
after his ordination he left home on the same day and lived in a secluded hut, 
meditating on the delays in his birth, and thus, winning insight, attained 
arahantship.</p>
<p>In Padumuttara Buddha’s time he made the resolve to be pre 
eminent among recipients of gifts, like <a href="sudassana.htm" title="s/sudassana.htm">Sudassana</a>, disciple of 
Padumuttara. To this end he gave alms for seven days to the Buddha and his 
monks. </p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder near 
Bandhumatī. The people gave alms to the Buddha and the Order in competition with 
the king, and when they were in need of honey, curds and sugar, Sīvalī gave 
enough of these for sixty eight thousand monks. </p>
<p>In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a king, named 
Varuna, and when the Buddha died, he made great offerings to the Bodhi tree, 
dying under it later. Then he was born in the Nimmānaratī world. </p>
<p>Thirty four times he was king of men, under the name of 
Subāhu (Thag.vs.60; ThagA.i.135). According to the Apadāna account (Ap.ii.492f) 
his father in his last birth was the Licchavi Mahāli. </p>
<p>The <a href="asaataruupa_jat_100.htm" title="ay/asaataruupa_jat_100.htm">Asātarūpa Jātaka</a> gives the reason for the 
delay in Sīvalī’s birth. Cf.Ap.ii.494, vs.29f. The story of Sīvalī is given also 
at Ud.ii.8; AA.i.130f.; DhA.iv.192f.; ii.196; J.i.408f. The Ud. follows the DhA. 
(iv.192f.) very closely. Both Ud. and J. say that a lay supporter of Moggallāna 
postponed his entertainment of the Buddha (who requested him to do so) to enable 
the Buddha to accept Suppavāsā’s invitation after the birth of the child. Other 
accounts omit this. Ud. says nothing about Sīvalī’s retirement from the world. 
The DhA. account of this differs from the others.</p>
<p>Sīvalī was declared by the Buddha (A.i.24) pre-eminent 
among recipients of gifts. It is said (ThagA.i.138; Ap.ii.495; AA.i.139) that 
when the Buddha visited <a href="revata.htm" title="r/revata.htm">Khadiravaniya-Revata</a>, he took Sīvalī with him because 
the road was difficult and provisions scarce. Sīvalī went to the Himālaya with 
five hundred others, to test his good luck. The gods provided them with 
everything. On Gandhamādana a deva, named Nāgadatta, entertained them for seven 
days on milk rice.</p>
