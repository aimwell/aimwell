  <h2>Brahmanimantanika Sutta</h2>

</ul>
<p>Preached at Jetavana. The Buddha tells the monks of his 
visit to Baka Brahmā, who holds the view that this world is eternal. The Buddha 
tells Baka that his view is false, whereupon Māra, having taken possession of 
one of the Brahmās, protests and urges the Buddha not to be recalcitrant. Baka 
himself agrees with the Buddha, who tells him of planes of existence of which 
Baka knows nothing. Baka then says that he will vanish from the Buddha’s 
presence, but finds himself unable to do so. The Buddha then vanishes and 
repeats a stanza for the Brahmās to hear. Baka admits defeat, but Māra again 
enters into a Brahmā and asks the Buddha not to communicate his doctrine to 
others. The Buddha refuses to agree to this. </p>
<p>The sutta is so called because it was preached on account 
of Baka Brahmā’s challenge (M.i.326ff). Cp. Bakabrahma Sutta.</p>
