<p>A brahmin. Once when Mahā Kaccana was 
staying at Varanā on the banks of the Kaddamadaha, Ārāmadanda came to see him 
and asked him why nobles quarrelled with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, and 
householders with householders. “Because of their bondage and servitude to 
sensual lusts,” answered Mahā Kaccāna; and for the same reason recluses 
quarrelled with recluses. “Is there anybody in the world who has passed beyond 
this bondage?” “Yes,” said Mahā Kaccāna, “in Sāvatthi lives the Exalted One,” 
and he proceeded to describe the Buddha’s virtues. Āramadanda stood up with 
clasped hands and, turning in the direction of Sāvatthi, he uttered his 
adoration of the Buddha. Thenceforward he became a disciple of Mahā Kaccāna.
