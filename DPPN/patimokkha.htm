  <h2>Pātimokkha</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to a set of two hundred and twenty seven 
rules to be observed by members of the Buddhist Order. The rules are not ethical 
but mainly economic, regulating the behaviour of the members of the Order 
towards one another in respect of clothes, dwellings, furniture, etc., held in 
common. In four cases out of the two hundred and twenty seven the punishment for 
infringement of a rule is exclusion from the Order; in all the remaining cases, 
it is merely suspension for a time.</p>
<p>The rules are arranged in seven sections </p>
<ul>
  <li>Pārajikā Dhammā</li>
  <li><a href="s4_sap.htm#Sanghadisesa" title="s/s4_sap.htm#Sanghadisesa">Sanghādisesā</a>-pātimokkha</li>
  <li>Aniyatā</li>
  <li>Nissaggiyāpācittiyā</li>
  <li>Pācittiyā-pātimokkha</li>
  <li>Patidesanīyā</li>
  <li>Sekkiyā pātimokkha</li>
</ul>
<p>corresponding very roughly to the degree of weight 
attached to their observance. </p>
<p>The Pātimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist 
Canon. The rules are included, in the <a href="vibhanga.htm" title="vy/vibhanga.htm">Sutta Vibhanga</a> (“sutta” here meaning 
“rule”), which contains besides the rules themselves, an old Commentary 
explaining them and a new Commentary containing further supplementary 
information concerning them. The rules are divided into two parts: one for the 
monks (Bhikkhu Pātimokkha) and the other for the nuns 
(Bhikkhuknī Pātimokkha). It is a moot point whether 
the rules originally appeared with the explanatory notes (as in the Vibhanga), 
the Pātimokkha being subsequently extracted, or whether the Pātimokkha alone was 
the older portion, the additional matter of the Vibhanga being the work of a 
subsequent revision. For a discussion of this, see Vin.i. Introd.xvi; Law: Pāli. 
Lit. 2ff.; Hastings: Encyclopaedia under Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>It is sometimes suggested (Law: op. cit., p.2) that the 
original number of Pātimokkha rules numbered only about one hundred and fifty. A 
passage in the Anguttara Nikāya (i.231-232) is quoted in support of this 
suggestion (sādhikam diyaddhasikkhāpadasatam). According to this theory the 
seventy five Sekhiyā rules were added later. See Law: op. cit., 19f.; Law’s 
argument, however, that the Pātimokkha rules were among the texts not recited at 
the First Council, is due to a wrong understanding of the Sumangala Vilāsinī 
passage (i.17). </p>
<p>The rules were recited at the gatherings of members of the 
Order (the Uposatha khandha of the Mahā Vagga (Vin.i.101 36) gives details of 
the procedure at these gatherings) in their respective districts on uposatha 
days (the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month). Each section of the rules 
is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the 
Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules. Silence 
implies absence of guilt. This practice of interrupting the recital seems to 
have been changed later (see Vin.ii.240 ff.) even though the old formula, asking 
the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.</p>
<p>The word pātimokkha is variously explained, the oldest 
explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (mukham), the 
chief (pamukham) of good qualities. The Sanskritised form of the word being 
prātimoksa, this led to a change in its significance, the completion of the 
recital being evidence that all those who have taken part are pure in respect of 
the specified offences — pātimokkha thus meaning 
acquittal, deliverance or discharge. But in most contexts the word simply means 
code — i.e., code of verses for the members of 
the Order.</p>
