<p>The Bodhisatta was once king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, 
and the Gandhāra king of Takkasilā besieged his capital. The Bodhisatta appeared 
before him and threatened to crush his forces, and the Gandhāra king fled.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to an 
ascetic who visited Jetavana in order to argue with the Buddha; but on seeing 
the Buddha seated in the hall expounding the Doctrine, his courage forsook him 
and he ran away with a crowd at his heels. He is identified with the Gandhāra 
king. (J.ii.219-21).</p>
