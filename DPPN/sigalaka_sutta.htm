<p><b>1. Sigālaka Sutta.</b> An old jackal, afflicted by 
mange, finds no pleasure in lonely places, or in the woods, or in the open air. 
Wherever he goes he falls into misfortune and disaster. Even so is a monk whose 
heart is possessed by gains, favours, or flattery. S.ii.230.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sigālaka Sutta. </b>Some old jackals, afflicted with 
mange, can go wherever they like. There are some Sākyan monks who cannot get 
even so much release. S.ii.127; the Commentary (SA.ii.169) says that the sutta 
was preached in reference to Devadatta.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sigālaka Sutta.</b>-Some Sākyan monks have not as 
much gratitude as a jackal (S.ii.272). The Commentary adds (SA.ii.170) that the 
sutta was preached in reference to Devadatta, and the story was about a jackal 
who was released by a peasant from a snake who had coiled round it. The snake 
attacked the peasant, and the jackal brought the peasant his axe in its mouth, 
enabling the man to kill the snake.</p>
