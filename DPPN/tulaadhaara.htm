<p>A mountain in the village of Vihāravāpi 
(Mhv.xxiii.90). It was in Rohana, and the vihāra on it was the residence of 
Mahāpaduma, the reciter of the Jātakas, from whom Ilanāga heard the Kapi Jātaka 
(Mhv.xxxv.30). </p>
<p>There was also, probably, a village of 
the same name as the mountain, for it is mentioned (Cv.xlvi.12) as having been 
given by Aggabodhi IV. for the maintenance of the Padhānaghara built by him.</p>
