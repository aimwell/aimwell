<p>The name of a people inhabiting the north east of Ceylon. 
They are first mentioned in the Chronicles (Cv.lxxxi.11), in the reign of 
Vijayabāhu III. (1232 36), who, with their help, gained the throne of Ceylon.
</p>
<p>They appear to have inhabited the frontier country between 
Jaffna and the Singhalese kingdom and were either subjects of one or other of 
these states, or affected complete independence, according to the strength of 
their neighbours. </p>
<p>Vijayabāhu IV. made friends with the Vanni chiefs and gave 
into their hands the protection of Anurādhapura (Cv.lxxxviii.87). They seem to 
have been a warlike people. Today they occupy a few small villages in the North 
Central Province of Ceylon and go in largely for hunting. </p>
<p>Their origin is unknown, though they are called Sīhalā 
(E.g., Cv.lxxxiii.10). Several of their chieftains are mentioned by name, as 
having been overcome by Bhuvanekabāhu I. — e.g., 
Kadalīvāta, Apāna, Tipa, Himiyānaka (Cv.xc.33). </p>
<p>The adjective from Vannī is Vañña. See, e.g., 
Cv.lxxxiii.10; lxxxvii.26.</p>
