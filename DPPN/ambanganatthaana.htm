<p>The spot where Devānampiyatissa gave a 
mango to Mahinda. </p>
<p>The Elder ate the mango and had the 
stone planted in the ground. Immediately a tree grew from it and the earth 
trembled. The Elder declared that the spot would become a place of assembly for 
the Sangha of Ceylon and would be called Ambangana. Sp.i.101.</p>
