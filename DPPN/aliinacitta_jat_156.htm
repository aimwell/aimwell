  <h2>Alīnacitta Jātaka (No. 156)</h2>

<p>Story of the Bodhisatta, when he was 
born as Alīnacitta, King of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>.</p>
<p>An elephant, while walking in the 
forest, trod on a splinter of acacia wood left there by carpenters while felling 
forest trees for wood for buildings in Benares. In great pain he came to the 
carpenters and lay down before them. They removed the splinter and owing to 
their treatment the wound healed. The elephant, in gratitude, spent the rest of 
his life working for them, and, before his death, he enlisted his son, white in 
colour, magnificent and high-bred, in their service. One day a half-dry cake of 
the young one’s dung was carried into the river by the flood (we are told that 
noble animals never dung or stale in water), and, floating down, stuck near the 
bathing place of the king’s elephants in Benares. The royal elephants, scenting 
the noble animal, refused to enter the water and fled. Having discovered the 
reason for their behaviour, the king decided to obtain the animal for himself, 
and going up-stream in a raft, he saw the carpenters and the white elephant 
working for them. The merchants agreed to give him to the king, but the elephant 
refused to move till the carpenters were adequately compensated. The animal was 
taken in procession to the city and with his help the king became supreme ruler 
over India.</p>
<p>In course of time the Queen Consort bore 
a son to the king, but the king died before his birth. The Kosala king thereupon 
laid siege to Benares, but desisted from attack for seven days, astrologers 
having predicted that at the end of that time the child would be born. The men 
of Benares had agreed to surrender unless the baby proved to be a boy. After 
seven days the queen bore a son named Alīnacitta, and the in habitants of 
Benares gave battle to the Kosala king. The queen, being told that they were in 
danger of defeat, dressed the baby and took him to the elephant for protection. 
The elephant had been kept in ignorance of the king’s death, lest he himself 
should die of a broken heart. But, on hearing the news, he sallied forth into 
battle and soon brought back the Kosala king as captive.</p>
<p>Alīnacitta became, in due course, king 
over the whole of Jambudīpa (J.ii.17-23). This story and that of the 
<a href="samvara_jat_462.htm" title="sa/samvara_jat_462.htm">Samvara 
Jātaka</a> were both related in connection with a monk who had become faint-hearted. 
For details see <a href="samvara.htm" title="sa/samvara.htm">Samvara</a>. The elephant of the Jātaka was the faint-hearted monk 
and the father-elephant was Sāriputta.</p>
<p>This Jātaka also was related by the 
Buddha, with reference to the Elder <a href="radha.htm" title="r/radha.htm">Rādha</a> whom Sāriputta had taken under his 
special spiritual protection and guidance, in gratitude for a ladleful of food 
that Rādha, as layman, had once given him. The Buddha pointed out that this was 
not the first time that Sāriputta had shown his gratitude (DhA.ii.106).</p>
