<p>1. Kandula.-The state-elephant of 
Dutthagāminī. He was of the Chaddanta race, and was left by his mother and 
discovered by a fisherman, Kandula, after whom he was named. Mhv.xxii.62f.</p>
<p>He grew up to be of great strength. When 
Dutthagāminī’s father died, his younger son, Tissa, took possession of the 
queen-mother and of Kandula, the state-elephant, and fled, but in the battle 
between the brothers, Kandula shook himself free from Tissa and went over to 
Dutthagāminī, whom he served to the end of his life. Kandula took a prominent 
part in the campaign against the Damilas, distinguishing himself particularly in 
the siege of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxiv.15, 89). In the single combat between Elāra 
and Dutthagāminī. Kandula attacked Elāra’s elephant, Mahāpabbata, and disabled 
him (Mhv.xxv.5-83). It is said that once the warrior Nandhimitta seized Kandula 
by his tusks and forced him on to his haunches, and Kandula nursed a grudge 
against him until Nandhimitta rescued him from being crushed under a gate-tower 
which fell on him during his attack on Vijitapura. Mhv.xxv.22, 39f.; see also 
Dpv.xviii.53; Mbv.133.</p>
<p>2. Kandula.-The fisherman who found the 
elephant Kandula and reported the matter to the king Mhv.xxii.62f.</p>
