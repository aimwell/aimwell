  <h2>Niganthā</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The name given to the Jains, the followers of 
<a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha 
Nātaputta</a>. Unlike the Acelakas, they wore one garment, a covering in front. But 
when praised for their modesty, they answered that their reason for wearing a 
garment was to prevent dust and dirt from falling into their alms dishes. For 
even dust and dirt are actual individuals and endowed with the principle of life 
(DhA.iii.489). </p>
<p>The chief precepts of the Niganthā are included in the 
cātuyāmasamvara — the fourfold restraint (for 
their beliefs and practices see <a href="nigantha_nataputta.htm" title="n/nigantha_nataputta.htm">Nigantha 
Nātaputta</a>). The chief centres of the Niganthas, in the time of the Buddha, seem to have 
been <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a> (e.g., J.iii.1; M.i.228) and 
<a href="naalandaa.htm" title="n/naalandaa.htm">Nālandā</a> (M.i.371), though they had settlements 
in other important towns, such as <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> (e.g., at Kālasilā, on the slopes of 
<a href="isigili.htm" title="i_/isigili.htm">Isigili</a>, 
M.i.92). 
</p>
<p>The chief patrons of the Buddha’s time were: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sīhasenāpati in <a href="vesaali.htm" title="vy/vesaali.htm">Vesāli</a>,  </li>
  <li>Upaligahapati in Nālandā and  </li>
  <li>Vappa the Sakyan in 
  Kapilavatthu (AA.ii.751).</li>
</ul>
<p>The books contain several names 
besides that of Nātaputta of distinguished members of the Nigantha Order 
-&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., Dīgha-Tapassī, and 
<a href="saccaka.htm" title="sa/saccaka.htm">Saccaka</a>, and 
also of several women, Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and <a href="patacara.htm" title="pa/patacara.htm">Patācārā</a> (J.iii.1). </p>
<p>The lay followers of the Niganthas wore white garments 
(M.ii.244).</p>
<p>In the Chalabhijāti classification of Pūrana Kassapa, the 
Ekasātaka-Niganthas occupied the third rank, the red (A.iii.384). The Buddha 
condemned the Niganthas as unworthy in ten respects:  </p>
<ol>
  <li>they were without faith, 
 
</li>
  <li>unrighteous,  </li>
  <li>without fear and shame,  </li>
  <li>they chose wicked men as friends,  </li>
  <li>extolled 
themselves and disparaged others,  </li>
  <li>were greedy of present gain, </li>
  <li>obstinate, </li>
  <li>untrustworthy,  </li>
  <li>sinful in their thoughts,  </li>
  <li>and held wrong views (A.v.150).  </li>
</ol>
<p>Their 
fast resembled a herdsman looking after the kine by day, which were restored to 
their owners at eventide (Ibid., i.205f). The Niganthas were so called because 
they claimed to be free from all bonds (amhākam ganthanakileso 
palibujjhanakileso natthi, kilesaganthirahitā mayan ti evam vāditāya 
laddhanāmavasena Nigantho) (E.g., MA.i.423).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Buddhist books record (M.ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210) 
that there was great dissension among the Niganthas after the death of Nātaputta 
at Pāvā. The Commentaries state (DA.iii.906; MA.ii.831) that Nātaputta, 
realizing on his death bed the folly and futility of his teaching, wished his 
followers to accept the Buddha’s teaching In order to bring this about, he 
taught his doctrine in two different ways to two different pupils, just before 
his death. To the one he said that his teaching was Nihilism (uccheda), and to 
the other that it was Eternalism (sassata). As a result, they quarrelled 
violently among themselves, and the Order broke up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That the Niganthas lasted till, at least, the time of 
Nāgasena, is admitted (Mil.p.4) by the fact that Milinda, was asked to consult a 
teacher called Nigantha Nātaputta, who, if at all historical, was probably the 
direct successor to the teacher of the same name, contemporary with the Buddha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is evidence in the Jātakas to show that the Nigantha 
Order was in existence prior to the life of the Buddha. Saccatapāvī, mentioned 
in the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.427), is described as a setasamanī, and may well have 
belonged to the Order of the Svetambaras, while in the Mahābodhi Jātaka 
(J.v.246) mention is made of a teacher who is identified with Nigantha Nātaputta 
himself.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a settlement of Niganthas in 
Ceylon from very early times. When Pandukābhaya laid out the city of 
Anurādhapura, he built also hermitages for several Niganthas&nbsp; — 
Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhanda (Mhv.x.97f). These continued to be inhabited even 
after the establishment of Buddhism in the Island, for we hear of them in the 
reign of Vattagāmanī (circa 44 A.C.). When Vattagāmanī pulled down the residence 
of the Nigantha Giri, because of his disloyalty to the king, he built on its 
site the Abhayagiri vihāra. (Ibid., xxxiii.42f.)</p>
