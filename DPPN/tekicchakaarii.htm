  <h2>Tekicchakārī (°kāni) Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was the son of the brahmin Subandhu, 
and was so-called because he was brought safely into the world with the aid of 
physicians. When Tekicchakārī was grown up his father, by his wisdom and policy, 
incurred the jealousy and suspicion of Cānakka, minister of Candagutta, who had 
him thrown into prison. Tekicchakārī, in his fright, fled, and, taking refuge 
with a forest-dwelling monk, entered the Order and dwelt in the open air, never 
sleeping and heedless of heat and cold. Māra, in the guise of a cowherd, tried 
to tempt him, but he developed insight and became an arahant.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was 
born in a physician’s family and cured a monk, named Asoka, and many others. 
Eight kappas ago he was a king named Sabbosadha (Thag.384-6; ThagA.i.440f).
</p>
<p>He is probably identical with Tikicchaka 
of the Apadāna (i.190).</p>
