<p>Once the Buddha was thinking compassionately of those suffering from the 
cruelty of rulers and wondering if it were possible to rule without causing 
suffering. Māra approaches and tries to make him absorbed in the fascination of 
exercising power, suggesting that if the Buddha wished he could change even the 
Himālaya into a mass of gold. But, says the Buddha, he has seen suffering and 
its source and will not, therefore, incline to sense desires. S.i.116.</p>
