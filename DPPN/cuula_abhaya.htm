<p>1. Cūlābhaya.-King of Ceylon (92-93 A.C.). 
He was the son of Ānanda gāmani and built the Cūlagallakavihāra. Sivalī was his 
younger sister. Mhv.xxxv.12-14; Dpv.xxi.39f.</p>
<p>2. Cūlābhaya.-A Thera who taught the 
Vinaya in Ceylon. Vin.v.3; Sp.i.63.</p>
<p>3. Cūlābhaya.-A Thera of Ceylon and a 
well-known commentator; he was known as Tipitaka-Cūlābhaya. He is several times 
quoted in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.11, 16; Vsm.69, 394, 397). He had a 
prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of Anurādhapura, allowing 
only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he 
asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner 
returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He 
was a contemporary of Cūlanāga (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), 
with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the Lohapāsāda) (DA.ii.442) 
of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his 
birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went 
with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to Nāgadīpa. On the way he stayed in a 
monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with 
another of like temperament in the vihāra, and Cūlābhaya, seeing them laugh 
aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dhātusamyutta that like 
joins with like. VibhA.457f.</p>
