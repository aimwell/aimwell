  <h2>Moliya Phagguna Thera</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>He was always friendly with the nuns and stood up for them 
in discussions with the monks. This was reported to the Buddha, who sent for him 
and preached the <a href="kakacuupama_s.htm" title="ka/kakacuupama_s.htm">Kakacūpama Sutta</a> (M.i.122ff). </p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.12f) is recorded a discussion 
between Moliya Phagguna and the Buddha, regarding the consciousness sustenance (viññānāhāra). 
Moliya asks a question as to who feeds on consciousness. The Buddha rejects the 
question as being wrongly put and similar questions follow, which the Buddha 
puts in a different form and to which he provides the answers. In another 
context (S.ii.50), in the same collection, Kalārakhattiya is reported as saying 
to Sāriputta that Moliya Phagguna had reverted to the lay life. </p>
<p><a href="buddhagosa.htm" title="b/buddhagosa.htm">Buddhaghosa</a> (SA.ii.22; MA.i.315) explains that the man’s 
name was Phagguna and that he was given the title of Moli because he wore a 
large knot of hair on the top of his head while he was a layman, and that the 
name persisted after he joined the Order. </p>
