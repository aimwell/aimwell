<h2>Mahāsāropama Sutta</h2>
<p>Preached at Gijjhakūta, soon after Devadatta’s secession. 
Some young men leave the household, being lured by the life of a monk. As monks, 
they receive presents, esteem, and repute. These things so please them and 
satisfy their aspirations that they become conceited and disparage others. Thus 
they grow remiss and a prey to Ill. Their case resembles that of a man who, 
needing the best of timber, goes into a forest and is satisfied with cutting off 
the leafy foliage or the bark of the trees, knowing nothing of the grades of 
wood. On the other hand, the monk who is satisfied only when he reaches the end 
of Ill is like a man who takes only the choicest timber, passing over the other.
