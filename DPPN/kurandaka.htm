<p>A cave, probably in Ceylon. It contained 
beautiful paintings of the renunciation of seven Buddhas, but the Elder 
Cittagutta (q.v.), who lived in the cave for a long time, never saw them because 
he had never lifted his eyes. </p>
<p>There was a great ironwood (nāga) tree 
at the entrance to the cave. </p>
<p>The Elder, at the request of the king, 
once went to visit him, but after seven days, not being happy in the palace, he 
returned to Kurandaka. Vsm.i.38f.</p>
