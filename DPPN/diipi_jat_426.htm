<p>Goatherds once occupied an ascetic’s 
hut, and, on their departure, left behind a she-goat who had strayed away. As 
she ran to join the others, she saw a panther in the way; she showed great 
daring and tried to pacify him with soft words, but all in vain, for he devoured 
her.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
she-goat whom Moggallāna once saw near his mountain hut. When she, however, saw 
a panther, she, with great daring, jumped over his body and escaped. J.iii.479f.</p>
