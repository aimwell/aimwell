<p>A king of the Nāgas. He lived in the 
heap of sand which was made by Aggidatta (q.v.) and his followers, who had made 
a vow to bring from somewhere a jar of sand and empty it at an agreed spot 
whenever a sinful thought occurred to them. When Moggallāna visited Aggidatta 
and asked him for a lodging, Aggidatta refused to give him one, but Moggallāna, 
in spite of his protests, occupied the sand-hill. Moggallāna overcame the power 
of the Nāga king by his iddhi-power, and when Aggidatta and his followers 
visited him the next morning, they found Ahicchatta standing with his hood over 
Moggallāna’s head as protection for him from the sun. DhA.iii.241ff.</p>
