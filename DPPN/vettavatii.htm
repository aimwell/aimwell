<p><b>1. Vettavatī. </b>A river, probably in the kingdom of 
Mejjha. According to the Mātanga Jātaka (J.iv.388; cf. Dvy. 451, 456), Mātanga 
lived in a hermitage on the upper reaches of the river in order to humble the 
pride of Jātimanta, who lived lower down. On the banks of the river was a city, 
also called Vettavatī. </p>
<p>In the Milinda-pañhā (p.114) the Vettavatī is mentioned as 
one of the ten chief rivers flowing from the Himālaya. It is probably identical 
with the Vetravatī mentioned in Kālidāsa’s Meghadūta, and is identified with the 
modern Betuva in Bhopal (the ancient Vidīsa).</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Vettavatī.</b> A channel branching off from the 
Parakkamasamudda; the sluice from which it started bore the same name. 
Cv.lxxix.44.</p>
