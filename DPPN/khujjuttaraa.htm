  <h2>Khujjuttarā</h2>

<p>She was born of a nurse in the house of 
the banker Ghosita (AA.i.232), and later became a slave of Queen 
<a href="samavati.htm" title="sa/samavati.htm">Sāmāvati</a>. The 
queen gave her daily the eight pieces of money allowed to her by the king for 
the purchase of flowers. Khujjuttarā bought flowers with four pieces from the 
gardener <a href="sumana.htm#5" title="s/sumana.htm#5">Sumana</a>, the remaining four pieces she kept. One day the Buddha visited 
Sumana, and Khujjuttarā, having heard the Buddha preach to him, became a 
Sotāpanna. That day she spent the whole amount on flowers. The queen asked her 
how she had obtained so many, and she told her the whole story. From that time 
Sāmāvatī showed Khujjuttarā all honour, bathed her in perfumed water, and heard 
the Dhamma from her. Khujjuttarā became, as it were, a mother to Sāmāvatī, and 
going regularly to hear the Dhamma, would return and preach it to her and her 
five hundred attendant women. Under the instruction of Khujjuttarā they all 
became sotāpannas. When Sāmāvatī expressed a desire to see the Buddha, 
Khujjuttarā suggested that she should pierce holes in the walls of the palace 
and gaze on the Buddha as he passed along the street. After the death of 
Sāmāvatī, Khujjuttarā seems to have spent all her time in religious works, 
listening to the preaching of the Dhamma. The Buddha declared her foremost among 
lay women by reason of her extensive knowledge (bahussutānam). A.i.26; 
DhA.i.208ff; AA.i.226, 237f; ItvA.23f.; PsA.498f.</p>
<p>Once, in the past, she was a 
serving-woman of the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, and one day, having seen a 
<a href="pacceka_buddha.htm" title="pa/pacceka_buddha.htm">Pacceka Buddha</a> 
who was slightly hunch-backed, she threw a blanket over her shoulder, and 
bending down to look like a hunchback, she imitated the Buddha’s manner of 
walking. Therefore, in this present birth she herself was hunchbacked. On 
another occasion eight Pacceka Buddhas, receiving their bowls filled with 
rice-porridge from the palace, found the bowls so hot that they were obliged to 
move them from one hand to the other. Seeing this, Khujjuttarā gave them eight 
ivory bracelets as stands for their bowls. It is said that these bracelets are 
still preserved in the <a href="nandamulapabbhara.htm" title="n/nandamulapabbhara.htm">Nandamūla-pabbhāra</a>. Because of this act Khujjuttarā 
obtained profound wisdom in this birth, and was able to learn the Tipitaka by 
heart. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the daughter of a treasurer, and 
had a friend who was a nun; one day when she was adorning herself at eventide 
the nun visited her, and as there was no servant-girl at the time Khujjuttarā 
asked the nun to do various things for her. As a result she was born as a slave. 
Her desire to become chief among learned lay-women was formed in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha, on her seeing a similar rank bestowed on a lay-woman 
(DhA.i.226f, etc.; Dvy.339-41).</p>
<p>It is said that the discourses in the 
Itivuttaka are those which Khujjuttarā learned from the Buddha and later 
repeated to Sāmāvatī and her attendant women. Because these discourses were all 
preached at Kosambī and repeated there by her, there was no need to specify the 
place of their preaching; hence the formula “Ekam samayam Bhagavā Kosambiyam 
viharati” is omitted, and instead is found “vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā arahatā.” 
(ItvA.32).</p>
<p>Khujjuttarā is several times mentioned 
as the paragon among lay-women disciples (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.368; 
S.ii.236), and in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.iii.910) 
she is given as an example of kāmabhoginiyo (women who enjoyed the pleasures of 
the senses). She possessed the patisambhidā while yet a householder, but it was 
the patisambhidā of the probationer (sekha) (Vsm.442; VibhA.388).</p>
<p>Khujjuttarā is identified with the 
slave-girl in the <a href="uraga_jat_154_354.htm" title="u/uraga_jat_154_354.htm">Uraga Jātaka</a> (J.iii.168) and in the
<a href="bhisa_jat_488.htm" title="b/bhisa_jat_488.htm">Bhisa Jātaka</a> (J.iv.314), 
the nurse in the <a href="culla_sutasoma_jat_525.htm" title="c/culla_sutasoma_jat_525.htm">Culla-Sutasoma Jātaka</a> (J.v.192) and the hunchback in the
<a href="kusa_jat_531.htm" title="ku/kusa_jat_531.htm">Kusa 
Jātaka</a> (J.v.312). Owing to her personal experience (abhijānato) she had the 
power of recalling her past births (Mil.78).</p>
<p>It is said (UdA.384) that when Sāmāvatī 
and her companions were burnt to death, Khujjuttarā escaped because she had not 
participated in their previous misdeeds. At the time of the fire she was absent 
from the palace, some say ten leagues away.</p>
