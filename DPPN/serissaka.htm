<p><b>1. Serissaka. </b>A <a href="yakkha.htm" title="y/yakkha.htm">Yakkha</a> chieftain to be invoked in 
time of need by followers of the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. D.iii.205.</p>

<p><b>2. Serissaka, Serīsaka.</b> A vimāna in the 
<a href="caatummahaaraajikaa.htm" title="c/caatummahaaraajikaa.htm">Cātummahārājika</a> world, which was occupied by 
<a href="payasi.htm" title="pa/payasi.htm">Pāyāsi</a> during his life there. 
<a href="gavampati.htm" title="g/gavampati.htm">Gavampati</a>, who used to go there for his siesta, met him and had a conversation 
with him, which he reported to the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> (D.ii.356f). The deva of the vimāna 
was also called Serīsaka, and is evidently to be identified with the Yakkha 
Serissaka. 
</p>
<p>Pāyāsi was born in the Serīsaka-vimāna, because, though he gave 
generously, he was careless about the manner of giving. 
<a href="vessavana.htm" title="vy/vessavana.htm">Vessavana</a> therefore 
stationed him in a desert, devoid of shade or water, to protect travellers from 
the dangers which beset them at the hands of non-humans. He came across some 
merchants from <a href="anga.htm" title="ay/anga.htm">Anga</a> and <a href="magadha.htm" title="ma/magadha.htm">Magadha</a> who had lost their way while journeying to
<a href="sindhu.htm" title="s/sindhu.htm">Sindhusovīra</a>. He revealed to them his identity, and they offered to hold a 
festival in his honour when they reached safety. But he suggested that gifts be 
given in his name to a pious man, named Sambhava, who was in their company. 
Later Sambhava joined the Order and became an arahant (Vv.vii.10; VvA.331).
</p>
<p>It is said (DA.iii.814; cf. ThagA.i.103) that the vimāna 
was called Serīsaka because there was, at its entrance, a large serīsa-tree, 
which bore fruit once in fifty years. Gavampati had earlier occupied the vimāna, 
when born as a devaputta. After his rebirth among humans, the vimāna was empty 
till occupied by Pāyāsi. But Gavampati sometimes visited it even after becoming 
an arahant.</p>
