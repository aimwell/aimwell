<p><b>1. Sukha. </b>A monk, generally known as Sukha 
Sāmanera. In his past life he had been Bhattabhatika (q.v.). In his last life he 
was born in the house of a supporter of Sāriputta. During her pregnancy, his 
mother gave alms to five hundred monks, with Sāriputta at their head. When he 
was seven years old, he entered the Order under Sāriputta, on which occasion his 
parents held a special almsgiving lasting for seven days.</p>
<p>Once, while going with Sāriputta for alms, he noticed 
several things, and like the novice Pandita (q.v.) asked the Elder numerous 
questions. Then he expressed a wish to return to the monastery. Sāriputta 
agreed, and Sukha turned back saying, “Sir, when you bring my food, pray bring 
me food of one hundred flavours. If you cannot obtain it through your own merit, 
you can obtain it through mine.” So saying, he returned to his cell and 
meditated on the nature of the body. Sakka’s throne was heated, and he sent the 
Four Regent Gods to keep away all noise from Sukha’s cell. He also bade the Sun 
and Moon stand still. Sukha, helped by this silence, became an anāgāmī.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sāriputta had gone to a house where he knew he 
could get the food desired by Sukha, and, having eaten there, returned with 
Sukha’s portion to the monastery. The Buddha, thinking that Sāriputta’s arrival 
might impede Sukha’s attainment of arahantship, appeared near the gate of 
Sukha’s cell and stood guard. As he stood there, the Buddha asked Sāriputta four 
questions. When the last question was answered, Sukha became an arahant. 
Thereupon Sāriputta opened the door and gave Sukha his food. Sukha ate it and 
washed the bowl. The Four Regent God’s left their post, Sakka let go the rope of 
the door of the novice’s cell, and the Sun and Moon started once more on their 
course. Evening at once came on, and the Buddha, on being asked the reason, 
explained that it was a usual occurrence when they who possess merit engage in 
meditation. DhA.iii.95ff.; op. the story of Pandita.</p>
