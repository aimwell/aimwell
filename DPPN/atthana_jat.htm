  <h2>Atthana Jātaka</h2>

</ul>
<p>On the untrustworthiness and 
treacherousness of women. A young merchant, Mahādhana, patronised a courtesan, 
giving her a thousand pieces daily. One day, having no time to fetch the money, 
he went empty-handed and was cast out. Thereupon, in disgust, he became an 
ascetic (J.iii.474ff).</p>
<p>The story is related to a monk who 
wished to leave the Order on account of a woman.</p>
