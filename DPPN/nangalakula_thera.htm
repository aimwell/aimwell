<p>An arahant. He was originally a very poor man. A monk of 
Jetavana, seeing him clad in a loin cloth, carrying a plough on his shoulder, 
suggested to him that he should become a monk. He was ordained, and, at his 
teacher’s suggestion, hung his loin cloth and plough on a tree near the 
monastery. He was called Napgalakula (ploughman) on account of his former 
calling. Whenever he felt discontented with monastic life, he would go to the 
tree and blame himself for his shamelessness in harbouring thoughts of returning 
to his former life. On being asked where he went, he would say “to my teacher.” 
One day he became an arahant, and when asked why he no longer went to his 
teacher, he answered that the need was no more. This was reported to the Buddha, 
who praised the monk for his self-admonition. DhA.iv.115 17.</p>
