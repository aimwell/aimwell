<p>Long ago, many seers of virtuous conduct 
lived in leaf huts in a wild forest. According to Buddhaghosa, they lived in the 
Himālays (SA.i.265); Vepacitti and Sakka were father- and son-in-law; sometimes 
they quarrelled, sometimes, as here, they were friends.</p>
<p>One day, Sakka and Vepacitti visited 
them. Vepacitti entered the hermitage by the principal gate, keeping his shoes 
on and his sword by his side, thereby insulting the seers and committing sin. 
Sakka, on the other hand, went in by the usual entrance, doffing his shoes and 
sword; with his canopy folded up, he stood to leeward of the seers, rendering 
them homage with clasped hands. The seers, addressing Sakka, asked him if he did 
not feel disgust at their smell, inasmuch as they were humans and he a god. 
Sakka answered that the scent of virtuous men is lovely, like unto a wreath of 
varied blossoms (S.i.226).</p>
