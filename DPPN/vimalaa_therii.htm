<p><b>1. Vimalā Therī. </b>The daughter of a courtesan of 
Vesāli. Having one day seen Moggallāna begging in Vesāli for alms, she went to 
his dwelling and tried to entice him. Some say, adds the Commentator, that she 
was influenced by the heretics. The incident is referred to at ThagA.ii.178, but 
Vimalā’s name is not given. </p>
<p>The Elder rebuked and admonished her, and she became a lay 
follower and later entered the Order. There after great effort, she became an 
arahant. ThigA.76f.; her Udāna verses are included in 
Thig.vs.72-6.</p>
