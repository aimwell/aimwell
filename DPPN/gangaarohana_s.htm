  <h2>Gangārohana Sutta</h2>

<p>The Culavamsa (Cv.xxxvii.191) mentions a 
sutta by this name. The Commentaries on the Dhammapada (DhA.iii.436ff) and the 
Khuddakapātha (KhpA.162ff) contain accounts of the visit paid by the Buddha to 
Vesāli in order to drive out from there the fears of famine and pestilence, and 
they describe in great detail the celebrations which took place as the Buddha 
returned to Rājagaha along the Ganges. This journey is called Gangārohana.
</p>
<p>The Sutta mentioned is probably, 
therefore, the Ratana Sutta (q.v.) which the Buddha preached at Vesāli.</p>
