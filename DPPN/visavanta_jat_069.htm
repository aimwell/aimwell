<p>The Bodhisatta was once a snake bite doctor, and, on one 
occasion, when a countryman had been bitten by a snake, the doctor ordered the 
snake to be brought and asked it to suck the poison out of the wound. This the 
snake refused to do even though threatened with death by the doctor.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a vow taken by 
Sāriputta. Some villagers once brought some meal cakes to the monastery, and 
when the monks present there had eaten, it was suggested that what remained 
should be saved for those monks who were absent in the village. This was done, 
but a young colleague of Sāriputta, arriving very late, found that Sāriputta had 
already eaten his portion, whereat he was very disappointed. Sāriputta 
immediately vowed never again to touch meal cakes, and the Buddha said that 
Sāriputta would never return to anything which he had once renounced. The snake 
is identified with Sāriputta. J.i.310f.</p>
