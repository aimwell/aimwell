  <h2><b>Pañcavudha Jātaka</b> (No. 55)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Bodhisatta born as king of Benares. He was the son of 
Brahmadatta, and was named Pañcāvudha-kumāra because eight hundred brahmins prophesied that he 
would win glory through prowess in arms. He studied in Takkasilā, and, at the 
end of his course, his teacher gave him a set of five weapons. On the way home 
he had a conflict with an ogre named Silesaloma, against whom his weapons were 
of no avail, as they could not penetrate the ogre’s hair. But he fought on, and 
the ogre, marvelling at his courage and his fearlessness, set him free. He 
thereupon preached to the ogre and converted him. Pañcāvudha later became king 
of Benares. J.i.272ff.</p>
<p>The ogre is identified with <a href="angulimaala.htm" title="ay/angulimaala.htm">Angulimāla</a>. The story was related in 
  reference to a monk who had renounced all effort. J.i.272ff.</p>
