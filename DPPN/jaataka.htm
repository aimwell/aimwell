<p>The tenth book of <a href="khuddaka_n.htm" title="ku/khuddaka_n.htm">Khuddaka Nikāya</a> of the 
Sutta Pitaka containing tales of the former births of the Buddha. The Jātaka 
also forms one of the nine angas or divisions of the Buddha’s teachings, grouped 
according to the subject matter (DA.i.15, 24). </p>
<p>The canonical book of the Jātakas (so 
far unpublished) contains only the verses, but it is almost certain that from 
the first there must have been handed down an oral commentary giving the stories 
in prose. This commentary later developed into the 
<a href="jaatakatthakathaa.htm" title="j/jaatakatthakathaa.htm">Jātakatthakathā</a>.
</p>
<p>Some of the Jātakas have been included 
in a separate compilation, called the <a href="cariyaapitaka.htm" title="c/cariyaapitaka.htm">Cariyā Pitaka</a>. It is not possible 
to say when the Jātakas in their present form came into existence nor how many 
of these were among the original number. In the time of the
<a href="niddesa.htm" title="n/niddesa.htm">Culla Niddesa</a>, there 
seem to have been five hundred Jātakas, because reference is made to 
pañcajātakasatāni (p.80; five hundred was the number seen by Fa Hsien in Ceylon 
(p.71)). Bas-reliefs of the third century have been found illustrating a number 
of Jātaka stories, and they presuppose the existence of a prose collection. 
Several Jātakas exist in the canonical books which are not included in the 
Jātaka collection. For a discussion on the Jātakas in all their aspects, see 
Rhys Davids Buddhist India, pp.189ff.</p>
<p>The <a href="diighabhaanakaa.htm" title="d/diighabhaanakaa.htm">Dīghabhānakas</a> included the Jātaka in 
the <a href="abhidhamma_pitaka.htm" title="am/abhidhamma_pitaka.htm">Abhidhamma Pitaka</a>. (DA.i.15; the Samantapāsādikā (i.251) contains a 
reference to a Jātakanikāya).</p>
<p>The Jātaka consists of twenty-two 
sections or nipātas.</p>
