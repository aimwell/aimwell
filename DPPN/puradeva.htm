<p>A god, evidently the tutelary deity of Anurādhapura.
</p>
<p>There was a shrine erected to him within the precincts of 
the Mahāvihāra. Near this shrine a battle took place between Dutthagāmanī and 
Bhalluka. Kandula considered it a lucky spot and led Dutthagāmanī’s forces up to 
it (Mhv.xxv. 87). </p>
<p>The shrine was to the north of the Mahāsusāna. MT. 486.</p>
