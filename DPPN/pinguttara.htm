<p>A lad of Mithilā who studied in Takkasilā and was given in 
marriage his teacher’s beautiful daughter. But he was unlucky and intensely 
disliked his wife, avoiding her whenever possible. On the way to Mithilā, when 
his wife climbed up a fig tree in order to assuage her hunger, he put thorns 
round the tree and left her there. King Videha of Mithilā rescued her and 
married her, naming her Udumbarā. Some time later she saw Pinguttara mending the 
road, and smiled at her own good fortune. The king was ready to kill her out of 
jealousy, but Mahosadha saved her life. J.vi.347f.</p>
