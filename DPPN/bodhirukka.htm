  <h2>Bodhirukka</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The generic name given to the tree under which a Buddha 
attains Enlightenment (D.A.ii.416). The tree is different in the case of each 
Buddha. Thus, </p>
<ul>
  <li>for Gotama and also for Kondañña it was an asvattha;
  </li>
  <li>for Dīpankara a sirīsa; </li>
  <li>for Mangala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita a nāga; 
  </li>
  <li>for Anomadassī an ajjuna; </li>
  <li>for Paduma and Nārada a mahāsona; </li>
  <li>for Padumuttara a salala; </li>
  <li>for Sumedha a nimba; </li>
  <li>for Sujāta a bamboo; </li>
  <li>for Piyadassī a kakudha; </li>
  <li>for Atthadassī a campaka; </li>
  <li>for Dhammadassī a bimbajāla; </li>
  <li>for Siddhattha a kanikāra; </li>
  <li>for Tissa an asana; </li>
  <li>for Phussa an āmanda; </li>
  <li>for Vipassī a pātalī; </li>
  <li>for Sikhī a pundarīka; </li>
  <li>for Vessabhū a sāla; </li>
  <li>for Kakusandha a sirīsa; </li>
  <li>for Konāgamma an udumbara; </li>
  <li>for Kassapa a banyan (see passim; the details differ 
  some what at BuA.247). </li>
</ul>
<p>The site of the Bodhi tree is the same for all Buddhas 
(BuA.247), and it forms the navel of the earth (J.iv.233) (puthuvinābhi). No 
other place can support the weight of the Buddha’s attainment. J.iv.229.</p>
<p>When no Bodhi tree grows, the Bodhimanda (ground round the 
Bodhi<span lang="en-us">-tree), for a distance 
of one royal karīsa, is devoid of all plants, even of any blade of grass, and is 
quite smooth, spread with sand like a silver plate, while all around it are 
grass, creepers and trees. None can travel in the air immediately above it, not 
even Sakka (J.iv.232f).</p>
<p>When the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the 
Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear; when the world emerges into existence 
again, it is the first to appear. A lotus springs there bringing it into view 
and if during the kappa thus begun a Buddha will be born, the lotus puts forth 
flowers, according to the number of Buddhas (DA.ii.412).</p>
<p>In the case of Gotama Buddha, his Bodhi tree sprang up on 
the day he was born (DA.ii.425; BuA.248). After his Enlightenment, he spent a 
whole week in front of it, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with 
gratitude. A shrine was later erected on the spot where he so stood, and was 
called the Animisalocana cetiya (q.v.). The spot was used as a shrine even in 
the lifetime of the Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used. While the 
Buddha was yet alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the 
name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of 
a seed from the Bodhi tree in Gayā in front of the gateway of Jetavana. For this 
purpose Moggallāna took a fruit from a tree at Gayā as it dropped from its 
stalk, before it reached the ground. It was planted in a golden jar by 
Anāthapindika with great pomp and ceremony. A sapling immediately sprouted 
forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one 
night under it, wrapt in meditation. This tree, because it was planted under the 
direction of Ānanda, came to be known as the Ānanda Bodhi (J.iv.228ff).</p>
<p>According to the Ceylon Chronicles (e.g., Mhv.xv), 
branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kappa were 
planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in 
Anurādhapura. The branch of Kakusandha’s tree was brought by a nun called 
Rucānandā, Konagamana’s by Kantakānandā (or Kanakadattā), and Kassapa’s by 
Sudhammā. Asoka was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a 
festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika (Mhv.xvii.17). His 
queen, Tissarakkhā was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became 
queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka’s reign), she caused the tree to be 
killed by means of mandu thorns (Mhv.xx.4f). The tree, however, grew again, and 
a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda. Among those present at the 
foundation of the Mahā Thūpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks, from this 
Vihāra, led by Cittagutta (Mhv.xxix.41).</p>
<p>Kittisirimegha of Ceylon, contemporary of Samudragupta, 
erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sanghārāma near the Mahābodhi-vihāra, 
chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. 
The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Hiouen Thsang 
(Beal, op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was 
probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to 
Ceylon.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Asoka’s reign the right branch of 
the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by 
Devānāmpiyatissa in the Mahāmeghavana. The Buddha, on his death bed, had 
resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon 
should detach itself (Mhv.xvii.46f). From Gayā, the branch was taken to 
Pātaliputta, thence to Tāmalittī, where it was placed in a ship and taken to 
Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anurādhapura, staying on the 
way at Tivakka. Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of 
the Tree were the nobles of Kājaragāma and of Candanagāma and of Tivakka. From 
the seeds of a fruit which grew on the tree sprang eight saplings, which were 
planted respectively </p>
<ul>
  <li>at Jambukola, </li>
  <li>in the village of Tivakka, </li>
  <li>at Thūpārāmā, </li>
  <li>at Issaramanārāma, </li>
  <li>in the court of the Pathamacetiya, </li>
  <li>in Cetiyagiri, </li>
  <li>in Kājaragāma and </li>
  <li>in Candanagāma (Mhv.xix.60ff.; for details in 
  connection with the bringing of the Bodhitree, see Mbv.144 ff). </li>
</ul>
<p>Thirty-two other saplings, from four other fruits, were 
planted here and there at a distance of one yojana. Ceremonies were instituted 
in honour of the Tree, the supervision of which was given over to Bodhāhārakula, 
at the head of which were the eight ministers of Asoka who, led by Bodhigutta 
and Sumitta (see Mbv.165f., for the names of the others), were sent as escorts 
of the Tree. Revenues were provided for these celebrations.</p>
<p>Later, King Dhātusena built a Bodhighara or roof over the 
Tree (Cv.xxxviii.431) while Silākāla made daily offerings at the shrine (see 
Cv.Trs.i.32, n. 6; Cv.xli.29), and Kittisirimegha had the Bodhighara covered 
with tin plates (Cv.xli.65). Mahānāga had the roof of the Bodhighara gilded, 
built a trench round the courtyard and set up Buddha images in the image house 
(Cv.xli.94). Aggabodhi I. erected a stone terrace round the Tree and placed, at 
the bottom of it, an oil pit to receive the oil for illuminations on festival 
days (Cv.xlii.19). Aggabodhi II. had a well dug for the use of pilgrims 
(Cv.xlii.66), and Moggallāna III. held a great celebration in the Tree’s honour 
(Cv.xliv.45). </p>
<p>Aggabodhi VII found the Bodhighara in ruins and had it 
rebuilt (Cv.xlviii.70); Mahinda II instituted a regular offering in its honour 
(Cv.xlviii.124), and Udaya III gave a village near Anurādhapura to the service 
of the Bodhi tree. Cv.liii.10.</p>
