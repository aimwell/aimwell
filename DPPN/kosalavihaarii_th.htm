<p>An arahant. He was born in Vesāli, and 
was one of those who heard the Buddha preach when he came to quieten the panic 
which arose there, as recorded in the Ratana Sutta (q.v.). After the sermon 
Kosalavihārī left the world. At the conclusion of his novitiate he dwelt in a 
forest near a village in Kosala. A lay adherent seeing him camping under a tree 
built for him a small hut, and there the thera attained arahantship. He acquired 
his name from having dwelt long in Kosala (Thag.59; ThagA.i.134f).</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
an ascetic in Himavā and gave the Buddha some tuberous roots. Fifty-four kappas 
ago he was a king named Sumekhalisama. He is evidently to be identified with 
Bilālidāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.145.</p>
