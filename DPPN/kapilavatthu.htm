  <h2>Kapilavatthu</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A city near the Himalaya, capital of the 
Sākiyans (q.v.). It was founded by the sons of Okkāka, on the site of the 
hermitage of the sage Kapila — see Kapila (3) (J.i.15, 49, 50, 54, 64, etc.; see 
also Divy 548, and Buddhacarita I.v.2). Near the city was the Lumbinīvana (q.v.) 
where the Buddha was born, and which became one of the four places of pilgrimage 
for the Buddhists. Close to Kapilavatthu flowed the river Rohinī, which formed 
the boundary between the kingdoms of the Sākyans and the Koliyans (DhA.iii.254). 
In the sixth century B.C. Kapilavatthu was the centre of a republic, at the head 
of which was Suddhodana. The administration and judicial business of the city 
and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the 
Santhāgārasālā (D.i.91; J.iv.145). It was here that Vidūdabha was received by 
the Sākyans (J.iv.146f). The walls of the city were eighteen cubits high 
(J.i.63; according to Mtu.ii.75 it had seven walls). From Kapilavatthu to the 
river Anomā, along the road taken by Gotama, when he left his home, was a 
distance of thirty yojanas (J.i.64). The city was sixty leagues from Rājagaha, 
and the Buddha took two months covering this distance when he visited his 
ancestral home, in the first year after his Enlightenment. On this journey the 
Buddha was accompanied by twenty thousand monks, and Kāludāyī went on ahead as 
harbinger. The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma near the city 
and, in the midst of his kinsmen, as he did at the foot of the Gandamba, the 
Buddha performed the Yamakapātihāriya to convince them of his powers. (J.i.87ff; 
this journey to Kapilavatthu was one of the scenes depicted in the relic-chamber 
of the Mahā-Thūpa, Mhv.xxx.81).</p>
<p>On this occasion he preached the 
Vessantara Jātaka. The next day the Buddha went begging in the city to the great 
horror of his father, who, on being explained that such was the custom of all 
Buddhas, became a sotāpanna and invited the Buddha and his monks to the palace. 
After the meal the Buddha preached to the women of the palace who, with the 
exception of Rāhulamātā, had all come to hear him. At the end of the sermon, 
Suddhodana became a sakadāgāmī and Mahā-Pajāpatī a sotāpanna. The Buddha visited 
Rāhulamātā in her dwelling and preached to her the Candakinnara Jātaka. The next 
day Nanda was ordained, and seven days later Rāhula (also Vin.i.82). As a result 
of the latter’s ordination, a rule was passed by the Buddha, at Suddhodana’s 
request, that no one should be ordained without the sanction of his parents, if 
they were alive. On the eighth day was preached the Mahādhammapāla Jātaka, and 
the king became an anāgāmī. The Buddha returned soon after to Rājagaha, stopping 
on the way at Anupiyā, where the conversions of Ānanda, Devadatta, Bhagu, 
Anuruddha, and Kimbila took place. </p>
<p>During the visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty 
thousand Sākyans from eighty thousand families had joined the Buddhist Order 
(Vin.ii.180; DhA.i.112; iv.124, etc.). According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary 
(BuA.4; Bu. p.5f), it was during this visit that, at the request of Sāriputta, 
the Buddha preached the Buddhavamsa. It is not possible to ascertain how many 
visits in all were paid by the Buddha to his native city, but it may be gathered 
from various references that he went there several times; two visits, in 
addition to the first already mentioned, were considered particularly memorable. 
On one of these he arrived in Kapilavatthu to prevent the Sākyans and the 
Koliyans, both his kinsmen, from fighting each other over the question of their 
sharing the water of the Rohinī; he appeared before them as they were preparing 
to slay each other, and convinced them of the futility of their wrath. On this 
occasion were preached the following Jātakas: the Phandana, the Daddabha, the 
Latukika, the Rukkhadhamma, and the Vattaka — also the Attadanda Sutta. 
Delighted by the intervention of the Buddha, the two tribes each gave him two 
hundred and fifty youths to enter his Order and, with these, he went on his alms 
rounds alternately to Kapilavatthu and to the capital of the Koliyans 
(J.v.412ff; the Sammodamāna Jātaka also seems to have been preached in reference 
to this quarrel, J.i.208). On this occasion he seems to have resided, not at the 
Nigrodhārāma, but in the Mahāvana.</p>
<p>The second visit of note was that paid 
by the Buddha when Vidūdabha (q.v), chagrined by the insult of the Sākyans, 
invaded Kapilavatthu in order to take his revenge. Three times Vidūdabha came 
with his forces, and three times he found the Buddha seated on the outskirts of 
Kapilavatthu, under a tree which gave him scarcely any shade; near by was a 
shady banyan-tree, in Vidūdabha’s realm; on being invited by Vidūdabha to 
partake of its shade, the Buddha replied, “Let be, O king; the shade of my 
kindred keeps me cool.” Thus three times Vidūdabha had to retire, his purpose 
unaccomplished; but the fourth time the Buddha, seeing the fate of the Sākyans, 
did not interfere (J.iv.152).</p>
<p>The Buddha certainly paid other visits 
besides these to Kapilavatthu. On one such visit he preached the Kanha Jātaka 
(J.iv.6ff). Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the 
Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma (S.v.369f; A.iii.284f; iv.220f; v.320f), 
Nandiya (S.v.403f; 397f; A.v.334f), Vappa (A.ii.196; M.i.91), and perhaps 
Sārakāni (S.v.372).</p>
<p>During one visit the Buddha was 
entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he 
preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked 
Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. We are told that the Sākyans decorated 
the town with lights for a yojana round, and stopped all noise while the Buddha 
was in the mote-hall (MA.ii.575). On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta 
(M.i.353ff).</p>
<p>The books record a visit paid by the 
Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. (This appears, 
from the context, to have been quite close to the Nigrodhārāma.)</p>
<p>The Buddha, worried by the noisy 
behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was 
wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati 
visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and 
there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to 
them on the holy life (S.iii.91f; Ud.25).</p>
<p>A curious incident is related in 
connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there 
after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of 
lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at 
length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharandu, 
the Kālāman (A.i.276f). On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing 
at Kapilavatthu after an illness (A.i.219).</p>
<p>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu 
believed in their kinsman’s great powers, even after the Buddha’s performance of 
various miracles. We find, for instance, Dandapānī meeting the Buddha in the 
Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his 
gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Dandapānī shook 
his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his 
brow puckered into three wrinkles (M.i.108f.; this was the occasion for the 
preaching of the Madhupindika Sutta). </p>
<p>Others were more convinced and 
patronised the Order — e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghatāya, who built cells for monks 
in the Nigrodhārāma (M.iii.109. As a result of noticing these cells, the Buddha 
preached the Mahasuññāta Sutta).</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha ordained ten 
thousand householders of Kapilavatthu with the “ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajā.” (Sp.i.241)</p>
<p>Mahānāma (q.v.) was the Buddha’s most 
frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūladukkhakkhandha Sutta (M.i.91f).</p>
<p>The Dakkhinā-vibhanga Sutta was preached 
as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those 
already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāligodhā by name, 
and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and 
wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha (S.v.396).</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are 
called Kapilavatthavā (E.g., S.iv.182).</p>
<p>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to 
Vesālī (Vin.ii.253), and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s 
disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthi (Sn.p.194).</p>
<p>From the Mahāvana, outside Kapilavatthu, 
the forest extended up to the Himalaya, and on the other side of the city it 
reached as far as the sea (MA.i.449, UdA.184; Sp.ii.393).</p>
<p>It is significant that, in spite of the 
accounts given of the greatness of Kapilavatthu, it was not mentioned by Ānanda 
among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more 
fittingly have died than in Kusinārā (D.ii.146). After the Buddha’s death, a 
portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine 
to hold them was erected in the city (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2). Here was deposited 
the rug (paccattharana) used by the Buddha (Bu.xxviii.8).</p>
<p>In the northern books the city was 
called Kapilavastu, Kapilapura, and Kapilāvhayapura (E.g. Lal. p.243, 28; The 
Buddha-carita, I.v.2 calls it Kapilasyavastu). According to the Dulva (Rockhill, 
p.11), the city was on the banks of the Bhagīrathī.</p>
<p>The identification of Kapilavatthu is 
not yet beyond the realm of conjecture. Hiouen Thsang (Beal ii.,p.13f) visited 
the city and found it like a wilderness. The Asoka inscriptions of the Lumbinī 
pillar and the Niglīva pillar are helpful in determining the site. Some identify 
the modern village of Piprāwā — famous for the vases found there — with 
Kapilavatthu (E.g., Fleet, J.R.A.S.1906, p.180; CAGI.711f). Others, including 
Rhys Davids, say there were two cities, one ancient and the other modern, 
founded after Vidūdabha’s conquest, and the ancient one they call Tilaura Kot. 
But the theory of two Kapilavatthu is rejected by some scholars. J.R.A.S.1906, 
pp.453, 563. See also the article by Mukherji on Kapilavastu in ERE.</p>
