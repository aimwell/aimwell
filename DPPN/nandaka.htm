<h4><A Name="1"></A>1. Nandaka (v.l. Nanda) Thera</h4>
<p>A householder of Savatthi. (The Apadāna (ii.499) says he 
belonged to a rich clan of merchants and that he entered the Order at the 
ceremony of dedication of Jetavana.)</p>
<p>Having entered the Order after hearing a sermon of the 
Buddha, he developed insight and soon attained arahantship. Once, at the 
Buddha’s request, he preached a sermon to the nuns; on the first day they became 
sotāpannas, and, on the second, five hundred of them attained arahantship. From 
that time the Buddha declared him foremost among exhorters of the nuns. [A.i.25. 
The sermon he preached is known as the Nandakovada Sutta (q.v.). The Anguttara 
Commentary (i.173) says that the nuns were Sakyan maidens who had entered the 
Order with Pajapati. At first Nandaka was reluctant to preach to them, they 
having been his wives in a previous birth when he was king, and he feared the 
calumny of his colleagues who might suggest that he wished to see his former 
companions. He, therefore, sent another monk in his place; but the Buddha, 
knowing that only Nanda’s preaching would effect the nuns' release, insisted on 
his going.] </p>
<p>The Theragāthā (vs.279 82) contains several verses uttered 
by him to a woman to whom he was once married. She met him begging alms in 
Savatthi and smiled to him with sinful heart.</p>
<p>His aspiration after eminence was formed in the time of 
Padumuttara Buddha, when he heard a disciple of that Buddha declared foremost 
among exhorters of nuns. He offered the Buddha a very costly robe and 
illuminated his bodhi tree. In the time of Kakusandha Buddha he was a karavīka 
bird and delighted the Buddha with his song. Later, he was a peacock, and sang 
three times daily at the door of a Pacceka Buddha’s cell. (ThagA. i.384f. The 
Apadana verses given in this context differ from those given in the Apadana 
itself (ii 499 f.).</p>
<p>The Anguttara Nikaya attributes two discourses to Nandaka. 
The first (A.i.193f. See sv., Sālha) was preached at the Migāramātupasāda and 
takes the form of a discussion with Sālha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohana, 
Pekkhuniya’s grandson&nbsp;&nbsp; on greed, covetousness, malice and delusion, 
and the benefits following their destruction. The second discourse is a sermon 
addressed to the monks at the waiting hall at Jetavana. It is said that the 
Buddha was attracted to the spot by the sound of Nandaka’s preaching, and, 
finding the door locked, stood fur a long time outside, listening (A.iv.358ff.; 
throughout the three watches of the night says the Commentary, AA.ii.794; also 
MA.i.348). When his back began to ache he knocked at the door, and, having 
entered, told Nandaka that he had been waiting until the end of his discourse to 
speak to him. Nandaka expressed. his regret that he should have kept the Buddha 
waiting and pleaded ignorance of his presence. The Buddha, conscious of 
Nandaka’s remorse, went on to praise his sermon, and said that the preaching of 
such sermons was the duty of all pious monks. When the Buddha left, Nandaka 
resumed his sermon, and told his audience of the five results of listening to 
the Dhamma in due season.</p>
<p>The Majjhima Commentary (ii.1019) states that Nandaka was 
once the leader of a guild of five hundred slaves of Benares and that Pajapati 
Gotami was his wife. One day, while fetching water, his wife noticed five 
hundred Pacceka Buddhas enter the city, and, on her return, she witnessed their 
departure. On enquiry, she learnt that they had applied to a merchant for 
lodgings for the rainy season, but that he had been unable to help. She 
undertook the care of them and, having enlisted the support of all her 
companions and their husbands, she and her husband ministered to the Pacceka 
Buddhas. As a result, they were born together as man and wife for many births, 
as were their helpers. In one birth Nandaka was king, and all the women became 
his wives. In this birth, the women were born as Pajapati’s companions, and they 
left the world in her company. To them was the Nandakovada Sutta preached.</p>

<h4><A Name="2"></A>2. Nandaka Thera</h4>
<p>A householder of Campā and younger brother of Bharata 
Thera. When these two heard that Sona Kolivisa had left the world&nbsp;&nbsp; 
and he so delicate&nbsp;&nbsp; they too renounced household life. Bharata soon 
acquired sixfold abhiññā, and, wishing to help Nandaka, came to him and 
discoursed on insight. A caravan passed by, and an ox, unable to pull his cart 
through a boggy place, fell down. The caravan leader had him released and fed 
with grass and water. He was then able to pull the cart out. Bharata drew 
Nandaka’s attention to the incident, and the latter, making that his object of 
meditation, soon attained arahantship. (Thag.173f.; ThagA.i.299f.)</p>
<p>In the time of Sikhī Buddha, Nandaka was a woodsman, and 
one day, while wandering about, he saw the Buddha’s cloistered walk. Pleased 
with its appearance, he scattered sand over it. (Ap.ii.418)</p>
<hr>
<h4><A Name="3"></A>3. Nandaka</h4>
<p>A yakkha. One day, while traveling through the air with 
his friend, he saw Sariputta sitting in samadhi, his head newly shaved. Ignoring 
his friend’s warning, Nandaka knocked Sariputta oh the head; the former 
immediately fell down, his body aflame, and swallowed up in hell. (MA.ii.814; 
Mil.100; the incident is related at Ud.iv.4, UdA.244ff., and referred to in 
ThagA.ii.116, but the yakkha’s name is not given. The blow was hard enough to 
kill an elephant seven or eight cubits high or shatter a rock. Sariputta was 
outside Kapota-Kandarā, Moggallana being near by).</p>
<hr>
<h4><A Name="4"></A>4. Nandaka</h4>
<p>A minister of the Licchavis. See Nandaka Sutta (2).</p>
<hr>
<h4><A Name="5"></A>5. Nandaka</h4>
<p>General of Pingala, king of Surattha, who reigned some two 
hundred years after the Buddha’s death. Nandaka was a Nihilist, and, after 
death, was born as a vemāmikapeta in the Vindhyā forest. His daughter, Uttarā, 
was a pious woman, and gave alms in his name to an arahant monk. Thereupon 
Nandaka attained celestial happiness. Wishing to liberate Pingala from his 
Nihilist views, Nandaka waited for him on his return from a conference with 
Dhammāsoka, and, having led the king to his abode, ministered to him. Then, 
revealing his identity, Nandaka advised the king to follow the Buddha’s 
teaching. Pv.iv.3; PvA.244ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4><A Name="NandakaSutta1"></A>1. Nandaka Sutta</h4>
<p>Records the incident of the Buddha listening to the 
preaching of Nandaka and the continuation of Nandaka’s sermon. See Nandaka (1). 
A.iv.358ff.</p>
<hr>
<h4><A Name="NandakaSutta2"></A>2. Nandaka (or <a name="Licchavi">Licchavi</a>) Sutta</h4>
<p>Nandaka, minister of the Licchavis, visits the Buddha at 
the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesali. The Buddha tells him that the Ariyan disciple, 
possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha., and 
having Ariyan virtues, is assured of enlightenment and happiness. During the 
conversation, a man comes to tell Nandaka that his bath is ready. Nandaka sends 
him away, saying that the inner washing loyalty to the Buddha is far more 
important. S.v.389.</p>
