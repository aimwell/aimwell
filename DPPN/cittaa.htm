<p>1. Cittā.-One of the four wives of Māgha. 
Māgha and his companions erected a hall, and Cittā had a flower garden laid out 
close by wherein she grew every kind of flowering tree, shrub and creeper. As a 
result she was reborn in Tāvatimsa as Sakka’s consort, and the Cittalatāvana 
came into being for her pleasure. DhA.i.269f; J.i.201f.</p>
<p>2. Cittā.-A Therī. She was the daughter 
of a leading citizen of Rājagaha. Hearing the Buddha preach, she entered the 
Order under Pajāpatī Gotamī. In her old age she went to Gijjhakūta and there, 
after meditation, she attained arahantship.</p>
<p>Ninety-four kappas ago she was a kinnarā 
on the bank of the Canda-bhāgā and there offered flowers to a Pacceka Buddha 
(Thig.vs.27f.; ThigA.33f). She is probably identical with Nalamālikā of the 
Apadāna (ii.528f).</p>
<p>3. Cittā.-One of the five queens of 
Okkāka. DA.i.278; SNA.i.352; MT.131.</p>
<p>4. Cittā.-See Ummāda-Cittā.</p>
<p>5. Cittā.-One of the chief lay women 
supporters of Sobhita Buddha. Bu.vii.23.</p>
<p>6. Cittā.-A laywoman who was among the 
chief supporters of Sikhī Buddha. Bu.xxi.22.</p>
<p>7. Cittā.-Daughter of the Madda king and 
wife of Sumitta, son of Sīhabāhu. MT.269; Mhv.viii.7.</p>
