<p><b>1. Sūkarapeta.</b> A peta who lived on Gijjhakūta. His 
body was human, but his head was that of a pig; out of his mouth grew a tail, 
and from the tail oozed maggots. Moggallāna saw him and reported the matter to 
the Buddha. The Buddha said that he, too, had seen the peta. In a previous birth 
he had been a preacher of the Law, but, wishing to obtain possession of a 
monastery which he visited, he brought about dissension between the two monks 
who had lived there on the friendliest terms. After death he suffered in Avīci 
for a whole Buddhantara, and was reborn in the peta world. DhA.iii.410ff.</p>

<p><b>2. Sūkarapeta.</b> A monk in the time of Kassapa 
Buddha, reborn as a peta on Gijjhakūta, where he was seen by Nārada. He had been 
restrained in his bodily actions, but had an evil tongue. He had the face of a 
pig. Pv.i.3; PvA.9f.</p>
