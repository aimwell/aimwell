  <h2>Kaccāni Jātaka (No. 417)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A young man devoted himself, after his 
father’s death, entirely to his mother, till the latter, much against his will, 
brought him a wife. The wife plotted to estrange mother and son, and the old 
woman had to leave the house. The wife, having given birth to a son, went about 
saying that if the mother-in-law had been with her such a blessing would have 
been impossible. When the old woman heard of this, she felt that such things 
could only be said because Right (Dhamma) was dead and, going into the cemetery, 
she started to perform a sacrifice in memory of the dead Right. Sakka’s throne 
becoming heated, he came down and, hearing her story, reconciled the old woman 
with her son and daughter-in-law by means of his great power. In the stanza 
spoken by Sakka, the old woman is addressed as Kaccāni and Kātiyānī. The 
scholiast explains that she belonged to the Kaccānagotta.</p>
<p>The story was related to a young man of 
Sāvatthi who looked after his aged mother till his wife came; then the wife 
undertook to tend her and for some time did her duties well. Later, she grew 
jealous of her husband’s love for his mother, and contrived by various means to 
make the son angry with the old woman. Finally, she asked her husband to choose 
between herself and his mother. The young man, without hesitation, stood up for 
his mother, and the wife, realising her folly, mended her ways. J.iii.422-8.</p>
