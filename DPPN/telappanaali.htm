<p>A village near Ujjeni. When Mahā Kaccāna 
went there on his way to Ujjeni, a poor girl of noble family, seeing him return 
empty handed from his alms-round, invited him into her house, cut off her 
beautiful hair, sent a slave-girl to sell it, and with the price of it gave alms 
to Kaccāna, keeping herself out of sight. </p>
<p>The Elder sent for her, and, at the 
sight of him, her hair grew as before. Candappajjota, hearing of the incident, 
sent for her and made her his queen. </p>
<p>She gave birth to a son called, after 
his maternal grandmother, Gopāla, and his mother thereafter came to be called 
Gopālamātā. AA.i.117f.</p>
