  <h2>Junha Jātaka (No.456)</h2>

<p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as Junha, 
son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He studied in Takkasilā and, on one 
occasion, while walking in the dark, he ran up against a brahmin, knocking him 
down and breaking his bowl. Junha raised the brahmin to his feet and, on being 
asked for the price of a meal, told the brahmin who he was. He had no money with 
him, but requested the brahmin to remind him of the circumstance when he should 
become king. In due time Junha was anointed, and the brahmin stood one day by 
the road when the king was passing on his elephant. The brahmin stretched out 
his hand, crying, “Victory to the king.” Junha took no notice, so the brahmin 
uttered a stanza to the effect that a king should not neglect a brahmin’s 
request. Junha then turned back, and the man explained who he was, asking Junha 
for five villages, one hundred slave girls, one thousand ornaments and two 
wives, all of which Junha gave him.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the eight boons granted by the Buddha to Ānanda when the latter became his 
constant attendant. Ānanda is identified with the brahmin (J.iv.95-100).
