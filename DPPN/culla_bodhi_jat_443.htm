<p>The Bodhisatta, under the name of Bodhi 
(he is also referred to as Culla-bodhi), was once born in a very rich family of 
Kāsi and studied in Takkasilā. His parents married him to a suitable wife but, 
because they had both come from the Brahma-world, they were free from passionate 
desire. After his parents' death, the two distributed their wealth and became 
ascetics. One day they came to the king’s park, and there the king fell in love 
with the woman and carried her away by force to the palace. When he told the 
Bodhisatta of this, he showed no resentment whatever. In the palace the king 
found that he could not win the woman’s love, and returned to the park, curious 
to know whether the ascetic really meant what he said. In the course of 
conversation the Bodhisatta told the king that he did not give way to anger 
because anger, once awakened, is difficult to curb.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a 
monk of violent temper. The king was Ānanda and the Bodhisatta’s wife was 
Rāhulamātā. (J.iv.22-27. Cf. the Ananusociya Jātaka).</p>
<p>The story is also given in the 
Jātakamālā as the Khudda-bodhi Jātaka (No.xxi), and in the Cariyāpitaka. Cyp., 
p.86.</p>
