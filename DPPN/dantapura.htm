<p>Capital of the Kalinga country, reigned 
over by King Sattabhu, contemporary with Renu (D.ii.235f). Other kings mentioned 
are Nālikīra (J.v.144) and Karandu (J.iii.376ff). The city is mentioned also in 
the Kurudhamma Jātaka (Also DhA.iv.89; see also Mtu.iii.361, 364), the 
Cullakālinga Jātaka, and the Kālingabodhi Jātaka (q.v.). The left eye-tooth of 
the Buddha was in Dantapura until taken to Ceylon by Dantākumāra. It had been 
handed over by Khema Thera (Dāthavamsa ii.52, 57; for its identification see 
CAGI.593) to Brahmadatta, king of Dantapura.</p>
