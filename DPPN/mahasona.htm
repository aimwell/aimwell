<p><b>1. Mahāsona.</b> An evil natured horse of Brahmadatta, 
king of Benares.</p>
<p>See the Suhanu Jātaka.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Mahāsona.</b> One of the ten chief warriors of 
Dutthagāmanī. He was born in Hunadarīvāpī in the Kulumbarī district as the 
eighth son of a man named Tissa. He was as strong as ten elephants, and took a 
prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura. Mhv.xxiii.2, 46ff.; xxv. 27f.; 44f. 
See 
also Ras.ii.86f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Mahāsona.</b> A monk in the time of Vattagāmani 
Abhaya. During the troubles caused by the brigand Brāhmanatissa, he travelled 
about in the company of Isidatta Thera, maintaining themselves on whatever they 
could find. One day a maiden made three balls of food, gave one to Isidatta, the 
second to Mahāsona, and wished to give the third to Isidatta; but her hand 
turned, and the food fell into Mahāsona’s bowl. Later, he lived with five 
hundred others in Mandalārāma vihāra. One day, while in Kālakagāma for alms, 
they were entertained by a pious devotee. The latter asked for Mahāsona and 
showed him special honour, though Mahāsona was only a junior monk. Some time 
after, Mahāsona returned to the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura and received many 
gifts, which he distributed among the Sangha. Vibhā.446ff.</p>
