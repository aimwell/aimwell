<p>An arahant. He was a Sākyan of Devadaha and was called 
Sammoda, but in his boyhood he suffered from rheumatism (vātaroga) and was 
crippled for some time; hence he came to be called Pakkha (cripple) even after 
his recovery. When the Buddha visited his kinsfolk he entered the Order and 
lived in the forest. One day he saw a kite flying up into the sky with some 
flesh, from which first one kite and then another grabbed a piece. Reflecting 
that worldly desires were like the flesh taken by the kite, he developed insight 
and attained arahantship.</p>
<p>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he had been a Yakkha 
senāpati with a retinue of eighty four thousand and had given the Buddha a 
divine robe.</p>
<p>Fifteen kappas ago he was sixteen times cakkavatti under 
the name of Suvāhana (Vāham). (Thag.vs.63; ThagA.i.144f).</p>
<p>He is evidently identical with Mahāparivāra of the 
Apadāna. Ap.i.146f.</p>
