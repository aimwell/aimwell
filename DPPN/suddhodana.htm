<p>A <a href="sakya.htm">Sākiyan</a> Rājā of <a href="kapilavatthu.htm">Kapilavatthu</a> and father of 
<a href="gotama.htm">Gotama</a> <a href="buddha.htm">Buddha</a>. 
</p>
<p>He was the son of <a href="siihahanu.htm">Sihahanu</a> and 
<a href="kaccaanaa.htm">Kaccānā</a>. His brothers 
were <a href="d2_h.htm#Dhotodana">Dhotodana</a>, 
<a href="s2_sal.htm#Sakkodana">Sakkodana</a>, <a href="s8_suy.htm#Sukkodana">Sukkodana</a> and 
<a href="amitodana.htm">Amitodana</a>, and his sisters were 
<a href="amitaa.htm">Amitā</a> 
and <a href="p2_ap.htm#Pamitaa">Pamitā</a>.  </p>
<p> 
<a href="mahamaayaa.htm">Māyā</a> was his chief consort, and, after her death her sister 
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Pajāpatī</a> 
was raised to her position (Mhv.ii.15f.; Dpv.iii.45; J.i.15, etc.).  </p>
<p>When 
soothsayers predicted that his son Gotama had two destinies awaiting him, either 
that of universal sovereignty or of Buddha hood, he exerted his utmost power to 
provide the prince with all kinds of luxuries in order to hold him fast to 
household life. It is said (E.g., J.i.54) that when <a href="asita.htm">Asita</a>, who was his father’s 
chaplain and his own teacher, visited Suddhodana to see the newly born prince, 
and paid homage to the infant by allowing his feet to rest on his head, 
Suddhodana was filled with wonder and himself worshipped the child. And when, at 
the ploughing ceremony, Suddhodana saw how the jambu-tree under which the child 
had been placed kept its shadow immoveable in order to protect him, and that the 
child was seated cross legged in the air, he again worshipped him (J.i.57f).</p>
<p>Later, when, in spite of all his father’s efforts, the 
prince had left household life and was practising austerities, news was brought 
to Suddhodana that his son had died owing to the severity of his penances. But 
he refused to believe it, saying that his son would never die without achieving 
his goal (J.i.67). When this was afterwards related to the Buddha, he preached 
the <a href="mahadhammapala_jat_447.htm">Mahādhammapāla Jātaka</a> and showed that in the past, too, Suddhodana had refused to believe that 
his son could have died even when he was shown the heap of his bones.</p>
<p>When news reached Suddhodana that his son had reached 
Enlightenment, he sent a messenger to Veluvana in <a href="raajagaha.htm">
Rājagaha</a> with ten thousand others to invite the Buddha to visit 
Kapilavatthu. But the messenger and his companions heard the Buddha preach, 
entered the Order, and forgot their mission. Nine times this happened. On the 
tenth occasion, Suddhodana sent <a href="kaaludaayii_th.htm">Kāludāyī</a> with permission for him to enter the 
Order on the express condition that he gave the king’s invitation to the Buddha. 
Kāludāyī kept his promise and the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, staying in the
<a href="nigrodharama.htm">Nigrodhārāma</a>. There, in reference to a 
shower of rain that fell, he preached the <a href="vessantara_jat_547.htm">Vessantara Jātaka</a>. The next 
day, when Suddhodana remonstrated with the Buddha because he was seen begging in 
the streets of Kapilavatthu, the Buddha told him that begging was the custom of 
all Buddhas, and Suddhodana hearing this became a
Sotāpanna. He invited the 
Buddha to his palace, where he entertained him, and at the end of the meal the 
Buddha preached to the king, who became a sakadāgāmī (J.i.90; cf. DhA.iii.164f). 
He became an anāgāmī after hearing the
<a href="mahadhammapala_jat_447.htm">Mahādhammapāla Jātaka</a>
(DhA.i.99; J.iv.55), and when he was about to die, the Buddha 
came from Vesāli to see him and preach to him, and Suddhodana became an arahant 
and died as a lay arahant (ThigA.141).</p>
<p>Nanda was Suddhodana’s son by
<a href="mahapajapati_gotami.htm">Mahā Pajāpati</a>, and he had also a 
daughter called Sundarī Nandā. When the Buddha ordained both
<a href="raahula.htm">Rāhula</a> and Nanda, Suddhodana was greatly 
distressed lest other parents should be similarly afflicted, and persuaded the 
Buddha to establish a rule that none should be ordained without the permission 
of his parents (Vin.i.82f).</p>
<p>Suddhodana was the Bodhisatta’s father in numerous births, 
but he is specially mentioned as such by name in only a few Jātakas e.g.,
