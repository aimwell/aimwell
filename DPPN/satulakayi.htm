<p>The wife of Jotika. </p>
<p>She came to him from Uttarakuru and brought with her a 
single pint pot of rice and three burning glasses (crystals). Whenever a meal 
was desired, the pot was placed on the crystals and the crystals blazed up. The 
food so prepared was never exhausted. When Jotika joined the Order, the 
divinities took Satulakāyī back to Uttarakuru. DhA.iv.209, 223.</p>
