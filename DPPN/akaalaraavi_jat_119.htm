<h2>Akālarāvi Jātaka (No. 119)</h2>
<p>A cock belonging to a school of young 
brahmins had its neck wrung because it crowed in and out of season. A monk, who 
is inconsiderately noisy, is the cause of the story being told (J.i.435-6).
</p>
<p>In the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.142f) 
the name of the story is given as Akālarāvikukkuta-Jātaka, and is related of the 
Thera Padhānikatissa, who is stated to have been the cock of the Jātaka story.</p>
