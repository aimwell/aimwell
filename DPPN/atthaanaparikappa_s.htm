  <h2>Atth훮naparikappa Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mentioned in the Atthas훮lin카 (p.336); it 
evidently refers to Anguttara i.222. </p>
<p>The sutta states that it were easier for 
the four great elements to change their characteristics than for an Ariyan 
disciple possessed with unvarying faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the 
Sangha, to be born in purgatory among lower animals or in the pets-world.</p>
