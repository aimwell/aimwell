<p>Once a golden crab as large as a 
threshing floor lived in Kuliradaha in the Himālaya, catching and eating the 
elephants who went into the lake to drink. In terror they left the district. The 
Bodhisatta, being born among the elephants, took leave of his father, and went 
back into the lake with his friends. The Bodhisatta, being the last to leave the 
water, was caught by the crab’s claws; hearing his cries of pain, all the other 
elephants ran away except his mate, whom he entreated not to leave him.</p>
<p>Realizing her duty, the she-elephant 
spoke to the crab words of coaxing and of flattery; the crab, fascinated by the 
sound of a female voice, let go his hold. Whereupon the Bodhisatta trampled him 
to death. From the two claws of the crab were later made the Ānaka and the 
Ālambara drums (q.v.).</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to 
the wife of a landowner of Sāvatthi. Husband and wife were on their way to 
collect some debts when they were waylaid by robbers. The robber chief, wishing 
to possess the wife for her beauty, planned to kill the husband. The wife 
expressed her determination to commit suicide if her husband were killed, and 
they were both released. The she-elephant of the Jātaka was the landowner’s wife 
(J.ii.341-5).</p>
<p>This Jātaka is illustrated in the Barhut 
Stupa (Cunningham; Bharhut plate xxv.2).</p>
<p>The Kakkata Jātaka is mentioned 
(DhA.i.119) among those preached by the Buddha giving instances where Ānanda 
offered his life for that of the Bodhisatta. The reference is evidently to the 
Suvannakakkata Jātaka (q.v.).</p>
<p>The story is also found in the Samyutta 
Commentary (SA.ii.167), but there the Bodhisatta’s life is saved not by his mate 
but by his mother.</p>
