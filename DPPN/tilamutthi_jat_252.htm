<p>Brahmadatta, son of the king of Benares, 
was sent to Takkasilā to study. One day, when going to bathe with his teacher, 
he ate some white seeds which an old woman had spread in the sun to dry. He did 
this on three different days; on the third day the woman reported him to the 
teacher and he was beaten. When Brahmadatta ascended the throne, be sent for the 
teacher, wishing to avenge this insult by killing him. The teacher did not come 
until the king had grown older, but when he did arrive, the sight of him so 
rekindled the king’s hatred, that he ordered him to be put to death. But the 
teacher spoke to him, telling him that if he had not been corrected in his 
youth, he would today be a highway robber. Convinced that the teacher’s action 
had been due to a desire for his welfare, Brahmadatta asked his forgiveness and 
showed him all honour.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
monk who showed resentment when advised. J.ii.277-82.</p>
