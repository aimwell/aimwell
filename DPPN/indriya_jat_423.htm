  <h2>Indriya Jātaka (No. 423)</h2>

<p>Once an ascetic named Nārada, younger 
brother of Kāladevala, became a disciple of the Bodhisatta Jotipāla (also called 
in the story Sarabhanga), and lived in the mountainous country of Arañjara. Near 
Nārada’s hermitage was a river, on the banks of which courtesans used to sit, 
tempting men. Nārada saw one of these courtesans, and becoming enamoured of her, 
forsook his meditations and pined away for lack of food. Kāladevala, being aware 
of this, tried to wean him from his desires. Nārada, however, refused to be 
comforted, even when his colleagues, Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara 
admonished him. In the end Sarabhanga himself was summoned and Nārada, having 
listened to the words of his Master, was persuaded to give up his passion.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
backsliding monk. He went about for alms with his teachers and instructors but, 
being their junior, he received very little attention. Dissatisfied with his 
food and treatment, he sought his wife of former days. She provided him with 
every comfort and gradually tempted him with the desire to become a householder 
again. When the monk’s fellow-celibates discovered his wish, they took him to 
the Buddha who preached to him this Jātaka, showing that in a past life, too, he 
had been sorely tempted by the same woman. Nārada was identified with the 
backsliding monk and the courtesan with the wife of his lay-days (J.iii.461-9).</p>
<p>The Buddha is stated on this occasion to 
have preached also the Kandina Jātaka (J.i.153ff), the Rādha Jātaka (J.i.495ff), 
the Ruhaka Jātaka (J.ii.113ff), the Kanavera Jātaka (J.iii.58ff), the Asanka 
Jātaka (J.iii.248ff) and the Alambusā Jātaka (J.v.152ff).</p>
<p>The Indriya Jātaka is also referred to 
in the Kāmavilāpa Jātaka (J.ii.443ff), but the connection between the two 
stories is not clear; perhaps the reference is to another story of the same 
name.</p>
