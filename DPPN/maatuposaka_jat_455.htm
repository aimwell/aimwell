<p>The Bodhisatta was once born as an elephant in the 
Himālaya and looked after his blind mother, who lived near Mount Candorana. One 
day he met a forester who had lost his way, and, feeling sorry for him, the 
elephant set him on the right path, carrying him on his back. But the forester 
was wicked, and, on his return to Benares, told the king about the elephant. The 
king asked him to fetch the elephant, who, seeing the forester approaching, 
meekly followed him lest his virtue be impaired. The elephant was received in 
the city with great pomp and placed in the royal stables as the state elephant, 
but he would touch no morsel of food. The king enquired into this and learnt of 
the elephant’s blind mother. Thereupon the elephant was set free, and returned 
to the Himālaya amid the applause of the people. The king built a town near the 
elephant’s dwelling, where he showed him great honour, and later, when, at his 
mother’s death, the elephant went away to the Karandaka monastery to wait on the 
ascetics there, the king did the same for them.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to a monk who tended 
his mother. For details see the Sāma Jātaka. Ānanda is identified with the king, 
whose name is given as Vedeha, and Mahāmāyā with the mother-elephant (J.iv.90 
5).</p>
<p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.13) calls this the 
Mātuposaka Nāgarāja<span lang="en-us"> Jātaka 
and gives the name of the elephant as Dhanapāla. It was related to the four sons 
of a brahmin who waited on their aged father. The audience shed floods of tears, 
so greatly were they moved, and the brahmin and his sons became sotāpannas.</p>
