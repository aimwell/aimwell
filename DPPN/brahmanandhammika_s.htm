  <h2>Brāhmanadhammika Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Several old and decrepit but wealthy (Mahāsāla) brahmins 
of Kosala, visit the Buddha at Jetavana and ask him if the practices of the 
brahmins of their own day are in conformity with those of old. The Buddha 
answers in the negative and describes in detail the high moral standard of the 
lives of ancient brahmins. In course of time, however, the brahmins were 
disturbed by the sight of the king’s wealth and adomed and bejewelled women, and 
became covetous of these. They thereupon induced the king to make offerings and 
hold sacrifices of animals that these might be for their own gain. Thus 
righteousuess decayed and disease became prevalent among men.</p>
<p>The brahmins, pleased with the Buddha’s sermon, declared 
themselves his followers. SN.pp.50 55.</p>
