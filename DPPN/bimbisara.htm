  <h2>BimbisÄra</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>King of Magadha and patron of the Buddha. </p>
<p>He ascended the throne at the age of fifteen and reigned 
in RÄjagaha for fifty two years. The Buddha was five years older than BimbisÄra, 
and it was not until fifteen years after his accession that BimbisÄra heard the 
Buddha preach and was converted by him. It is said (Mhv.ii.25ff.; Dpv.iii.50ff ) 
that the two were friends in their youth owing to the friendship which existed 
between their fathers. BimbisÄraâ€™s father was called BhÄti (MT.137; Dpv.iii.52); 
according to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, op. cit., 16) he was called MahÄpaduma 
and his Mother BimbÄ«.</p>
<p>But according to the PabbajÄ Sutta (SN.vs.405ff.; also 
J.i.66 and DhA.i.85; also Rockhill, p. 27) the first meeting between the Buddha 
and BimbisÄra took place in RÄjagaha under the Pandavapabbata, only after the 
Buddhaâ€™s Renunciation. The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace 
windows, sent messengers after him. On learning, that he was resting after his 
meal, BimbisÄra followed him and offered him a place in his court. This the 
Buddha refused, revealing his identity. The Commentary adds (SNA.ii.386) that 
BimbisÄra wished him success in his quest and asked him to visit first RÄjagaha 
as soon as he had attained Enlightenment. It was in fulfilment of this promise 
that the Buddha visited RÄjagaha immediately after his conversion of the 
TebhÄtika JatilÄ. He stayed at the Supatittha cetiya in LatthivanuyyÄna, whither 
BimbisÄra, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his 
respects. The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with BimbisÄra at 
their head, became sotÄpannas. On the following day the Buddha and hiss large 
retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of BimbisÄra. Sakka, in the guise of a 
young man, preceded them to the palace, singing songs of glory of the Buddha. At 
the conclusion of the meal, BimbisÄra poured water from a golden jar on the 
Buddhaâ€™s hand and dedicated Veluvana for the use of him and of his monks 
(Vin.i.35ff). </p>
<p>It was this gift of Veluvana, which formed the model for 
DevÄnampiyatissaâ€™s gift of the MahÄmeghavana to Mahinda (Mhv.xv.17). The gift of 
Veluvana was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic chamber of the MahÄ 
ThÅ«pa (Mhv.xxx.80). It may have been in Veluvana that the king built for the 
monks a storeyed house, fully plastered (Vin.ii.154). With the attainment of 
sopÄtatti, the king declared that all the five ambitions of his life had been 
fulfilled: that he might become king, that the Buddha might visit his realm, 
that he might wait on the Buddha, that the Buddha might teach him the doctrine, 
that he might understand it (Vin.i.36). According to BuA. (p. 18f.) the king 
became a SotÄpanna after listening to the MahÄ-NÄrada 
JÄtaka.</p>
<p>From this moment up till the time of his death, a period 
of thirty seven years, BimbisÄra did all in his power to help on the new 
religion and to further its growth. He set an example to his subjects in the 
practice of the precepts by taking the uposatha vows on six days, of each month 
(PvA.209).</p>
<p>BimbisÄraâ€™s chief queen was KosaladevÄ« (q.v.), daughter of 
MahÄkosala and sister of Pasenadi. On the day of her marriage she received, as 
part of her dowry, a village in KÄsi, for her bath money. Her son was AjÄtasattu 
(also J.iii.121). BimbisÄra had other wives as well; KhemÄ, who, at first, would 
not even visit the Buddha till enticed by BimbisÄraâ€™s descriptions of the 
beauties of Veluvana; and the courtesan PadumavatÄ«, who was brought from UjjenÄ«, 
with the help of a Yakkha, so that RÄjagaha might not lack a NagarasobhinÄ«. Both 
these later became nuns. PadumavatÄ«â€™s son was Abhaya. BimbisÄra had another son 
by AmbapÄlÄ«, known as Vimala KondaÃ±Ã±a, and two others, by different wives, known 
as SÄ«lava and Jayasena. A daughter, Cundi, is also mentioned.</p>
<p>BimbisÄraâ€™s death, according to the Commentaries, was a 
sad one (E.g., DA.i.135 ff.; see also Vin.ii.190f). Soothsayers had predicted, 
before the birth of AjÄtasattu, that he would bring about the death of his 
father, for which reason his mother had wished to bring about an abortion. But 
BimbisÄra would not hear of this, and when the boy was born, treated him with 
the greatest affection (for details see AjÄtasattu). When the prince came of 
age, Devadatta, by an exhibition of his iddhi-power, 
won him over to his side and persuaded him to 
encompass the death of his father, BimbisÄraâ€™s patronage of the Buddha being the 
greatest obstacle in the path of Devadatta. The plot was discovered, and 
BimbisÄraâ€™s ministers advised him to kill AjÄtasattu, Devadatta and their 
associates. But BimbisÄra sent for AjÄtasattu and, on hearing that he desired 
power, abdicated in his favour. Devadatta chided AjÄtasattu for a fool. â€œYou are 
like a man who puts a skin over a drum in which is a rat,â€ and he urged on 
AjÄtasattu the need for the destruction of BimbisÄra.</p>
<p>But no weapon could injure BimbisÄra (probably because he 
was a SotÄpanna, he also had the power of judging the status of anyone by his 
voice – e.g., in the case of Kumbhaghosa, DhA.i.233), it was therefore decided 
that he should be starved to death, and with this end in view he was imprisoned 
in a hot house (tÄpanageha) with orders that none but the mother of AjÄtasattu 
should visit him. On her visits she took with her a golden vessel filled with 
food which she concealed in her clothes. When this was discovered she took food 
in her head dress (molÄ«), and, later, she was obliged to take what food she 
could conceal in her footgear. But all these ways were discovered, and then the 
queen visited BimbisÄra after having bathed in scented water and smeared her 
person with catumadhura (the four kinds of sweets). The king licked her person 
and that was his only sustenance. In the end the visits of the queen were 
forbidden; but the king continued to live by walking about his cell meditating. 
AjÄtasattu, hearing of this, sent barbers to cut open his feet, fill the wounds 
with salt and vinegar, and burn them with coals. It is said that when the 
barbers appeared BimbisÄra thought his son had relented and had sent them to 
shave him and cut his hair. But on learning their real purpose, he showed not 
the least resentment and let them do their work, much against their will. (In a 
previous birth he had walked about in the courtyard of a cetiya with shoes on, 
hence this punishment!) Soon after, BimbisÄra died, and was reborn in the 
CÄtummahÄrÄjika world as a Yakkha named Janavasabbha, in the retinue of 
Vessavana. The Janavasabha Sutta records an account of a visit paid by 
Janavasabha to the Buddha some time after.</p>
<p>A son was born to AjÄtasattu on the day of BimbisÄraâ€™s 
death. The joy be experienced at the birth of his son made him realize something 
of the affection his own father must have felt for him, and he questioned his 
mother. She told him stories of his childhood, and he repented, rather 
belatedly, of his folly and cruelty. Soon after, his mother died of grief, and 
her death gave rise to the protracted war between AjÄtasattu and Pasenadi, as 
mentioned elsewhere (J.ii.237, 403).</p>
<p>The books contain no mention of any special sermons 
preached by the Buddha to BimbisÄra nor of any questions asked by him of the 
Buddha.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When he heard that the Buddha intended to perform a 
miracle, although he had ordered his disciples to refrain from doing so, 
BimbisÄra had doubts about the propriety of this and questioned the Buddha who 
set his doubts at rest (DhA.iii.204; J.iii.263f.). It was also at the request of 
BimbisÄra that the Buddha established the custom of the monks assembling on the 
first, eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month (Vin.i.101f.).</p>
<p>Perhaps, like AnÄthapindika, his equal in devotion to the 
Buddha, he refrained from giving the Buddha extra trouble, or perhaps the 
affairs of his kingdom, which was three hundred leagues in extent, did not 
permit him enough leisure for frequent visits to the Buddha. (DhA.iii.205; the 
kingdom included eighty thousand villages, gÄma, Vin.i.179).</p>
<p>It is said that he once visited four monks â€” 
Godhika, SubÄhu, Valliya and Uttiya â€” and 
invited them to spend the rainy season at RÄjagaha. He built for them four huts, 
but forgot to have them roofed, with the result that the gods withheld the rains 
until the king remembered the omission (ThagA.i.125). He similarly forgot his 
promise to give Pilindavaccha a park keeper, if the Buddha would sanction such a 
gift. Five hundred days later he remembered his promise and to make amends, gave 
five hundred park keepers with a special village for their residence, called 
Ä€rÄmikagÄma or PilindagÄma (Vin.i.207f.).</p>
<p>BimbisÄraâ€™s affection for the Buddha was unbounded. When 
the Licchavis sent MahÄli, who was a member of BimbisÄraâ€™s retinue, to beg the 
Buddha to visit VesÄli, BimbisÄra did not himself try to persuade the Buddha to 
do so, but when the Buddha agreed to go he repaired the whole road from RÄjagaha 
to the Ganges â€” a distance of five leagues â€” for 
the Buddha to walk upon; he erected a rest house at the end of each league, and 
spread flowers of five different colours knee deep along the whole way. Two 
parasols were provided for the Buddha and one for each monk. The king himself 
accompanied the Buddha in order to look after him, offering him flowers and 
perfume and all requisites throughout the journey, which lasted five days. 
Arrived at the river, he fastened two boats together decked with flowers and 
jewels and followed the Buddhaâ€™s boat into the water up to his neck. When the 
Buddha had gone, the king set up an encampment on the river bank, awaiting his 
return; he then escorted him back to RÄjagaha with similar pomp and ceremony 
(DhA.iii.438 ff).</p>
<p>Great cordiality existed between BimbisÄra and Pasenadi. 
They were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other. 
Pasenadi once visited BimbisÄra in order to obtain from him a person of 
unbounded wealth (amitabhoga) for his kingdom. BimbisÄra had five such â€” 
Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and KÄkavaliya; but Pasenadi had none. The 
request was granted, and Mendakaâ€™s son, DhanaÃ±jaya, was sent back to Kosala with 
Pasenadi (DhA.i.385f.; AA.i.220). Some of these were richer than BimbisÄra
-&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g., Jotiya (q.v.), whose house was built entirely 
of jewels while the kingâ€™s palace was of wood; but the king showed no jealousy 
(DhA.iv.211).</p>
<p>BimbisÄra also maintained friendly relations with other 
kings, such as PukkasÄti, king of TakkasilÄ, Candappajjota, king of UjjenÄ«, to 
whom he sent his own physician JÄ«vaka to tend in his 
illness â€” and RudrÄyana of Roruka (Dvy.545).</p>
<p>Among the ministers and personal retinue of BimbisÄra are 
mentioned Sona-Kolvisa, the flower gatherer Sumana who 
supplied the king with eight measures of jasmine flowers, the minister Koliya, 
the treasurer Kumbbaghosaka and his physician JÄ«vaka. The last named was 
discovered for him by the prince Abhaya when he was suffering from a fistula. 
The kingâ€™s garments were stained with blood and his queens mocked him. JÄ«vaka 
cured the king with one single anointing; the king offered him the ornaments of 
the five hundred women of the palace, and when he refused to take these, he was 
appointed physician to the king, the women of the seraglio and the fraternity of 
monks under the Buddha (Vin.i.272f).</p>
<p>When DhammadinnÄ wished to leave the world, BimbisÄra gave 
her, at her husbandâ€™s request, a golden palanquin and allowed her to go round 
the city in procession (MA.i.516).</p>
<p>BimbisÄra is generally referred to as Seniya BimbisÄra. 
The Commentaries explain Seniya as meaning â€œpossessed of a large followingâ€ or 
as â€œbelonging to the Seniyagotta,â€ and BimbisÄra as meaning â€œof a golden 
colour,â€ bimbÄ« meaning gold (e.g., UdA.104). According to Tibetan sources, BimbÄ« 
was the name of his mother, and from this his own name was derived; but another 
reason was that he was radiant like the morning sun (Rockhill 16,&nbsp; See also 
MA.i.292).</p>
<p>In the time of Phussa Buddha, when the Buddhaâ€™s three step 
brothers, sons of King Jayasena, obtained their fatherâ€™s leave to entertain the 
Buddha for three months, BimbisÄra, then head of a certain district, looked 
after all the arrangements. His associates in this task were born as petas, and 
he gave alms to the Buddha in their name in order to relieve their sufferings.
</p>
<p>See Tirokudda Sutta, also PvA.21ff.; for his intercession 
on behalf of another pets. see PvA.89.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, BimbisÄra was considered the happiest 
of men, but the Buddha declared (e.g., M.i.95) that he himself was far happier 
than the king.</p>
<p>The kahÄpana in use in RÄjagaha during BimbisÄraâ€™s time 
was the standard of money adopted by the Buddha in the formation of those rules 
into which the matter of money entered (Sp.ii.297).</p>
<p>BimbisÄra had a white banner and one of his epithets was 
Pandaraketu (Thag.vs.64; ThagA.i.147). Nothing is said about his future destiny, 
but he is represented in the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.206) as expressing the wish 
to become a SakadÄgÄmÄ«, and this wish may have been fulfilled.</p>
