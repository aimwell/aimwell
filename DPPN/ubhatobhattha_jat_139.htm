<p>Once in a village of line-fishermen one 
of the men took his tackle and went with his little son to fish. A snag caught 
hold of his line, but the man, thinking it was a big fish, sent his son home to 
ask his mother to pick a quarrel with the neighbours in order to keep them 
occupied lest they should claim a share of his catch. When the boy had gone, the 
fisherman went into the water to drag the fish, but he struck against the snag 
and was blinded in both eyes. Moreover a robber stole his clothes from the bank 
and his wife was taken before the village chief and fined and beaten for 
quarrelling. The Bodhisatta who was a Tree-deva saw all this happen and drew a 
moral from it. The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is identified 
with the fisherman, all his enterprises having come to grief. J.i.482-4.</p>
