<p><b>1. Jarā Sutta</b>.-Once, when the Buddha was 
on a visit to <a href="saketa.htm" title="sa/saketa.htm">Sāketa</a>, a rich brahmin and his wife, seeing him, called him their 
son and ministered to him with great affection. It is said that for five hundred 
births they had been the parents of the Bodhisatta. At the conclusion of a meal 
the Buddha preached to them and they became Sotāpannas. After the Buddha left 
Sāketa they continued to lead pious lives and became arahants before death. At 
their funeral they were accorded all the honours due to arahants, and at the 
conclusion of the ceremonies the Buddha, who was present, preached this sutta to 
those assembled there (SNA.ii.531ff; DhA.iii.317ff; cp. — 
<a href="saketa_jat_068_237.htm" title="sa/saketa_jat_068_237.htm">Sāketa Jātaka</a>).</p>
<p>From selfishness come grief and avarice. 
The monk who lives away from the world, un-smeared by it, is independent and 
becomes purified. SN.804-813 explained at MNid.i.117ff.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Jarā Sutta.</b>-Righteousness remains 
good even in old age; faith is a lucky stance, wisdom the jewel among men and 
merit the wealth none can steal. S.i.36.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Jarā Sutta.</b>-Everything is subject to 
decay — the eye, objects, etc. S.iv.27.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Jarā Sutta.</b>-The Buddha sits, one 
afternoon, outside the <a href="migaramatupasada.htm" title="me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm">Migāramātupāsāda</a>, warming his limbs in the sun, and 
Ānanda, while chafing the Buddha’s limbs with his hands, tells him that his skin 
is no longer clear, his limbs are slack and his body bent. The Buddha explains 
that this is but natural, old age being inherent in youth and decay and death 
being inevitable. S.v.216.</p>
