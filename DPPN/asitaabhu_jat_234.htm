  <h2>Asitābhu Jātaka (No. 234)</h2>
  </li>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a holy ascetic 
living in the Himālaya. At that time the king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a>, growing jealous of his 
son Prince Brahmadatta, banished both him and his wife, Asitābhū. They went to 
the Himālaya and lived in a hut of leaves. One day the prince, becoming 
enamoured of a Candakinnarī, followed her, forsaking his wife. (The kinnarī’s 
name was Candā, see Candā 9). Asitābhū went to the Bodhisatta and, having 
developed various superhuman powers, returned to her hut. Brahmadatta, having 
failed in his quest, returned to the hut where he found his wife poised in 
mid-air uttering songs of joy over her newfound freedom. When she left, he lived 
in solitude till, at his father’s death, he succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>The story was told in reference to a 
young girl, the daughter of a servitor of the two chief disciples. She was 
married, but finding her husband neglectful of her, visited the two Chief 
Disciples. Under their instruction she attained the First Fruit of the Path and 
embraced the religious life, ultimately becoming an arahant.</p>
<p>She was Asitābhū in the previous birth 
(J.ii.229ff).</p>
<p>The story is referred to in the Vibhanga 
Commentary (p.470f) in connection with a King of Benares who, having gone into 
the forest with his queen to eat roast flesh, fell in love with a kinnarī and 
deserted his wife. When he returned to his queen he found her flying through the 
air away from him, having developed iddhi powers. A tree-sprite then uttered a 
stanza, citing the example of Asitābhū. </p>
