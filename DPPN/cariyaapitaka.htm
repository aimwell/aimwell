</ul>
<p>One of the fifteen books of the <a href="khuddaka_n.htm" title="ku/khuddaka_n.htm">Khuddaka Nikāya</a>, generally placed last in the list. It contains tales in metrical verse of the Buddha’s previous births, chiefly setting forth the ten pāramī, by which he attained Enlightenment. Each story is called a Cariyā. The stories told here in verse are parallel to the corresponding Jātaka stories in prose, and pre-suppose a familiar acquaintance with all the incidents of the prose tales. 
The first two pāramī are illustrated by ten stories each, while the remaining pāramī have only fifteen stories between them.</p>
<p>The <a href="diighabhaanakaa.htm" title="d/diighabhaanakaa.htm">Dīgha-bhānakas</a> refused to include the 
Cariyāpitaka in their canonical books, but it was accepted by the 
<a href="majjhimabhanaka.htm" title="ma/majjhimabhanaka.htm">Majjhima-bhānakas</a> (DA.i.15, 23).</p>
<p>There exists a Commentary on the 
Cariyāpitaka which is ascribed to <a href="dhammapaala.htm" title="d/dhammapaala.htm">Dhammapāla</a> and which forms a part of the 
Paramathadīpanī. (Published in the Hewavitarane Bequest Series, vol.xxvi.; 
1929).  </p>
<p>According to the Commentary (CypA.1, 2), the Cariyāpitaka was preached by 
the <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> at the
<a href="nigrodharama.htm" title="n/nigrodharama.htm">Nigrodhārāma</a>, after the conclusion of the 
<a href="buddhavamsa.htm" title="b/buddhavamsa.htm">Buddhavamsa</a> and at 
the request of  
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a>. </p>
<p>It was preached by Mahinda at the Nandanavana in 
Anurādhapura, soon after his arrival in Ceylon (Dpv.xiv.45; but see Mhv.xv.179).</p>
