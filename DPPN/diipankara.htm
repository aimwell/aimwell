  <h2>Dīpankara</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The first of the 
twenty-four Buddhas.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>He was born in Rammavatī,  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>his father being King Sudeva (v.l. 
Sumedha) and  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>his mother Sumedhā.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>For ten thousand years he lived in the 
household, in three palaces, Hamsā, Koñcā and Mayūrā.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>His wife was Padumā and 
his son Usabhakkhandha (Samavatakkhandha).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He left home on an elephant and 
practised austerities for ten months.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>His Bodhi-tree was the Pipphalī and grass 
for his seat was given by an Ājīvaka named Sunanda.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>His first sermon was 
preached at Nandārāma (Sunandārāma) at Sirighara, where he converted the 
heretics.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He had three great gatherings of his followers.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He was always attended 
by eighty-four thousand arahants, and his body was eighty cubits in height.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>He 
died at Nandārāma at the age of one hundred thousand years and his thūpa was 
thirty-six yojanas high.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Sumangala and Tissa were his chief monks,  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Nandā and 
Sunandā his chief nuns, while  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Sāgata (v.l. Nanda) was his constant attendant. 
 
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Tapassu and Bhallika were his chief lay patrons among men and Sirimā and Sonā 
among women.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It was during the time of Dīpankara 
Buddha that the ascetic <a href="sumedha.htm" title="s/sumedha.htm">Sumedha</a> (q.v.), who later became 
<a href="gotama.htm" title="g/gotama.htm">Gotama</a> — <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a>, first 
declared his intention of becoming an aspirant for Enlightenment (a 
<a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a>).</p>
<p>After Dīpankara’s death, his doctrine 
lasted for one hundred thousand years. Bu.ii.207ff; BuA.104f; J.i.29; Mhv.i.5; 
Dpv.iii.31; DhA.i.69; but see Mtu.i.193ff., where the details differ from those 
given here.</p>
