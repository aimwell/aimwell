<p><b>1. Uruvelā.</b>-A locality on the banks of 
the <a href="neranjara.htm" title="n/neranjara.htm">Nerañjarā</a>, in the neighbourhood of the Bodhi-tree at Buddhagayā. Here, after 
leaving <a href="aalara_kaalaama.htm" title="aa/aalara_kaalaama.htm">Alāra</a> and 
<a href="uddaka_raamaputta.htm" title="u/uddaka_raamaputta.htm">Uddaka</a>, the Bodhisatta practised during six years the most 
severe penances. His companions were the <a href="pancavaggiya.htm" title="pa/pancavaggiya.htm">Pañcavaggiya</a>-monks, who, however, left 
him when he relaxed the severity of his austerities (M.i.166). The place chosen 
by the Bodhisatta for his penances was called <a href="senaaniinigama.htm" title="s/senaaniinigama.htm">Senā-nigama</a>.  </p>
<p>The Jātaka version 
(J.i.67f) contains additional particulars. It relates that once the Bodhisatta 
fainted under his austerities, and the news was conveyed to his father that he 
was dead. <a href="suddhodana.htm" title="s/suddhodana.htm">Suddhodana</a>, however, refused to believe this, remembering the prophecy 
of <a href="kaaladevala.htm" title="ka/kaaladevala.htm">Kāladevala</a>. When the Bodhisatta decided to take ordinary food again, it was 
given to him by a girl, <a href="sujaataa.htm" title="s/sujaataa.htm">Sujātā</a>, daughter of 
<a href="s6_siy.htm#Senani" title="s/s6_siy.htm#Senani">Senānī</a> of the township of Senānī. In 
the neighbourhood of Uruvelā were also the Ajapāla Banyan-tree, the Mucalinda-tree 
and the Rājāyatana-tree, where the Buddha spent some time after his 
Enlightenment, and where various shrines, such as the 
<a href="animisa_cetiya.htm" title="ay/animisa_cetiya.htm">Animisa-cetiya</a>, the 
<a href="ratanacankama_cetiya.htm" title="r/ratanacankama_cetiya.htm">Ratanacankama-cetiya</a> and the 
<a href="ratanaghara_cetiya.htm" title="r/ratanaghara_cetiya.htm">Ratanaghara</a> later came into existence. </p>
<p>From Uruvela the Buddha 
went to <a href="isipatana.htm" title="i_/isipatana.htm">Isipatana</a>, but after, he had made sixty-one arahants and sent them out 
on tour to preach the Doctrine, he returned to Uruvelā, to the 
<a href="kappaasika.htm" title="ka/kappaasika.htm">Kappāsikavanasanda</a> and converted the 
<a href="bhaddavaggiya.htm" title="b/bhaddavaggiya.htm">Bhaddavaggiyā</a> (Vin.i.23f; DhA.i.72). At 
Uruvelā dwelt also the Tebhātika-Jatilas: <a href="uruvela_kassapa.htm" title="u/uruvela_kassapa.htm">Uruvela-Kassapa</a>,
<a href="nadi_kassapa.htm" title="n/nadi_kassapa.htm">Nadī-Kassapa</a> and
<a href="gayaa_kassapa.htm" title="g/gayaa_kassapa.htm">Gayā-Kassapa</a>, 
who all became followers of the Buddha (Vin.i.25).</p>
<p>According to the Ceylon Chronicles 
(E.g., Mhv.i.17ff; Dpv.i.35, 38, 81), it was while spending the rainy season at 
Uruvelā, waiting for the time when the Kassapa brothers should be ripe for 
conversion, that the Buddha, on the full-moon day of Phussa, in the ninth month 
after the Enlightenment, paid his first visit to Ceylon.</p>
<p>Mention is made of several temptations 
of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvela, apart from the supreme contest with 
<a href="maara.htm" title="ma/maara.htm">Māra</a>, under the Bodhi-tree. Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night 
in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark 
night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and 
assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Māra tried to 
fill the Buddha’s mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from 
all fetters and won complete Enlightenment (S.i.103ff). Seven years after the 
Buddha’s Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha 
discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away 
discomfited, that Mars’s three daughters, Tanhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final 
effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose (S.i.124f).  </p>
<p>It was at Uruvelā, 
too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of 
preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and 
prejudices. The Brahmā <a href="sahampati.htm" title="sa/sahampati.htm">Sahampatī</a> thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way 
to such diffidence (S.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f). It is recorded that either on this 
very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha’s mind that 
the sole method of winning Nibbāna was to cultivate the four 
satipatthānas and 
that Sahampatī visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (S.v.167; and 
again, 185). A different version occurs elsewhere (S.v.232), where the thought 
which arose in the Buddha’s mind referred to the five controlling faculties (saddhindriya, 
etc.), and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a 
monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.</p>
<p>The name Uruvela is explained as meaning 
a great sandbank (mahā velā, mahanto vālikarāsi). A story is told which 
furnishes an alternative explanation: Before the Buddha’s appearance in the 
world, ten thousand ascetics lived in this locality, and they decided among 
themselves that if any evil thought arose in the mind of any one of them, he 
should carry a basket of sand to a certain spot. The sand so collected 
eventually formed a great bank (AA.ii.476; UdA.26; MA.i.376; MT.84). In the 
Divyāvadāna (p.202), the place is called Uruvilvā. The Mahāvastu (ii.207) 
mentions four villages as being in Uruvelā: Praskandaka, Balākalpa, Ujjangala 
and Jangala.</p>

<p><b>2. Uruvelā.</b>-A township in Ceylon, 
founded by one of the ministers of Vijaya (Dpv.ix.35; Mhv.vii.45). According to 
a different tradition (Mhv.ix.9; perhaps this refers to another settlement), it 
was founded by a brother of Bhaddakacānā, called Uruvela. Uruvelā was evidently 
a port as well, because we are told that when Dutthagāmanī decided to build the 
Mahā-Thūpa, six wagonloads of pearls as large as myrobalan fruit, mixed with 
coral, appeared on dry land at the Uruvela-pattana (Mhv.xxviii.36). Near Uruvelā 
was the Vallī-vihāra, built by Subha (Mhv.xxxv.58).</p>
<p>Geiger thinks (Mhv.Trs.189, n.2) that 
Uruvelā was near the mouth of the modern Kalā Oya, five yojanas — i.e. about 
forty miles — to the west of Anurādhapura.</p>

<p><b>3. Uruvelā.</b>-A village to which Queen Sugalā (q.v.) fled, taking the sacred relies, the Alms Bowl and the Tooth Relic 
(Cv.lxxiv.88). It is identified with Etimole about five or six miles south-east 
of Monorāgala (Cv.Trs.ii.29, n.4). It is perhaps to be identified with 
Uruvelamandapa.</p>
