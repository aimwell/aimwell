<p>2. Ujjaya Sutta.-Ujjaya’s request to the 
Buddha (referred to above under Ujjaya 3) for a teaching which would bring him 
welfare in both worlds and the Buddha’s reply thereto, detailing four qualities 
which would bring prosperity in this world — the accomplishments of exertion (utthānasampādā), 
and of protection (ārakkhasampadā), friendship with the good (kalyānamittatā), 
and regular living (samajīvitā) — and four others for bringing happiness in the 
next — viz., the four sampadā (accomplishments) of sīla (morality), citta 
(concentration and meditation), cāga (generosity), and paññā (higher wisdom).
