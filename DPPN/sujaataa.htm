<hr>
<p><b>1. Sujātā. </b>An aggasāvikā of Sobhita Buddha. J.i.35; 
Bu.vii.22.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Sujātā.</b> An aggasāvikā of Piyadassī Buddha. 
J.i.39; Bu.xiv.21.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Sujātā.</b> Mother of Padumuttara Buddha. J.i.37; 
Bu.xi.19; MA.ii.722; DhA.i.417.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Sujātā. </b>Mother of Kondañña Buddha. Bu.iii.25; 
J.i.30.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Sujātā.</b> An Asura maiden who became the wife of 
Sakka. See Sujā.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Sujātā. </b>Daughter of Senānī, a landowner of the 
village of Senānī near Uruvelā. She made a promise to the god of the banyan tree 
near by that she would offer a meal of milk rice to the god if she gave birth to 
a son. Her wish was fulfilled, the son was born, and she sent her maid, Punnā, 
to prepare the place for the offering. This was on the very day of the Buddha’s 
Enlightenment, and Punnā, finding Gotama sitting under the banyan, thought that 
he was the tree god present in person to receive the offering. She brought the 
news to Sujātā, who, in great joy, brought the food in a golden bowl and offered 
it to him.</p>
<p>Gotama took the bowl to the river bank, bathed at the 
Suppatitthita ford and ate the food. This was his only meal for forty nine days. 
J.i.68f.; DhA.i.71, etc. In Lal.334-7 (267f.) nine girls are mentioned as giving 
food to the Buddha during his austerities. Cf. Dvy.392, where two are given, 
Nandā and Nandabalā.</p>
<p>Sujātā’s meal was considered one of the most important of 
those offered to the Buddha, and the Devas, therefore, added to it divine 
flavours.</p>
<p>Yasa (q.v.) was Sujātā’s son, and when he attained 
arahantship his father, who had come in search of him, became the Buddha’s 
follower and invited him to a meal. The Buddha accepted the invitation and went 
with Yasa to the house. The Buddha preached at the end of the meal, and both 
Sujātā and Yasa’s wife became sotāpannas. On that day Sujātā took the threefold 
formula of Refuge. She thus became foremost among lay women who had taken the 
threefold formula (aggam upāsikānam pathamam saranam gacchantīnam) (SNA.i.154; 
D.ii.135). She had made an earnest resolve to attain this eminence in the time 
of Padumuttara Buddha. A.i.26; AA.i.217f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>7. Sujātā. </b>
&nbsp;An upāsikā of Ñātikā. The Buddha 
said that she had become a sotāpanna and had thus assured for herself the 
attainment of arahantship. D.ii.92; S.v.356f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>8. Sujātā.</b> Youngest sister of Visākhā. She was the 
daughter of Dhanañjayasetthi and was given in marriage to Anāthapindika’s son. 
She was very haughty and obstinate. One day, when the Buddha visited 
Anāthapindika’s house, she was scolding the servants. The Buddha stopped what he 
was saying, and, asking what the noise was, sent for her and described to her 
the seven kinds of wives that were in the world. She listened to the sermon and 
altered her ways (A.iv.91f.; J.ii.347f).</p>
<p>The Sujāta Jātaka (No. 269) was preached to her.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>9. Sujātā.</b> A maiden of Benares. See the Manicora 
Jātaka. She is identified with Rāhulamātā. J.ii.125.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>10. Sujātā Therī. </b>She was the daughter of a setthi 
of Sāketa and was given in marriage to a husband of equal rank, with whom she 
lived happily. One day, while on her way home from a carnival, she saw the 
Buddha at Añjanavana and listened to his preaching. Even as she sat there her 
insight was completed, and she became an arahant. She went home, obtained her 
husband’s permission, and joined the Order. Thig.145-50; ThigA.136f.</p>
