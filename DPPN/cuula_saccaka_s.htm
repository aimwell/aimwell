  <h2>Cūla-Saccaka Sutta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Saccaka Niganthīputta goes about Vesāli 
saying that he is unable to find his match in discussion. He meets Assaji and, 
after a preliminary debate with him, goes with a large company of Licchavis to 
seek the Buddha in the Mahāvana. He questions the Buddha on his method of 
training, and the Buddha explains this to him. The talk then turns on Self, and 
the Buddha points out the emptiness of Saccaka’s contentions. Saccaka (here 
referred to as Aggivessana) refuses to acknowledge defeat until the Yakkha 
Vajirapāni threatens to smite him. Saccaka is driven to yield point after point 
till the sweat streams from his brow, and the Buddha shows the assembled 
multitude how his own skin remains quite dry. In the end, Saccaka invites the 
Buddha and his disciples to a meal on the next day. M.i.227ff</p>
