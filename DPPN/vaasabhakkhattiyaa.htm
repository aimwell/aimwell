<p>Daughter of <a href="mahanama_th.htm#3" title="maha/mahanama_th.htm#3">Mahānāma</a> the Sākiyan by a slave-woman named 
Nāgamundā (J.i.133). When <a href="pasenadi.htm" title="pa/pasenadi.htm">Pasenadi</a> asked for a 
Sākiyan girl in marriage, she was 
given to him. Mahā-nāma went through the pretence of eating with her in order to 
allay Pasenadi’s suspicions. It is said (J.iv.145) that Mahā-nāma sat down to 
eat with her, but that as he was about to take the first mouthful, a messenger 
arrived, as prearranged, and brought him an urgent letter. He, thereupon, left 
the food uneaten in order to read the letter, and asked Vāsabhakkhattiyā to 
finish her meal.</p>
<p><a href="viduudabha.htm" title="vy/viduudabha.htm">Vidūdabha</a> was the son of
Vāsabhakkhattiyā. It was this deceit practised on Pasenadi 
which made Vidūdabha take his revenge on the Sākiyans (DhA.i.345 f; J.iv.145f).
</p>
<p>It is said that when Pasenadi discovered 
Vāsabhakkhattiyā’s servile origin, he degraded both her and her son from their 
rank, and that they never went outside the palace (J.i.133f.; iv.148; aft also 
M.ii.110, where she is called Vāsabhā). </p>
<p>When the Buddha heard of this, he visited the king, 
preached to him the <a href="katthahaari_jak_7.htm" title="ka/katthahaari_jak_7.htm">Katthahāri Jātaka</a>, and had the queen restored to 
honour.</p>
