<p><b>1. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.</b>-He was the 
son of a banker in Setavyā and he went to see the Buddha who was visiting the 
town and staying in the Simsapā-wood. The Buddha preached to him on the 
impermanence of all component things and at the end of the sermon he became an 
arahant. He received his name because he won insight by hearing the Dhamma only 
once.</p>
<p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was 
a tree-sprite and, coming across some monks who had lost their way, he looked 
after them, gave them food and directed them to their destination. After the 
death of Kassapa Buddha, he was born as the son of Suyāma and great-grandson of 
Kikī and became king of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> under the name of Kikī Brahmadatta. Not finding 
anyone capable of preaching the Doctrine to him, he left his throne in disgust 
and started on his way to Himavā. As he went along the road, Sakka appeared 
before him and quoted to him some lines on the impermanence of all things. 
Satisfied therewith, the king returned to his capital (Thag.v.67; ThagA.i.151f).</p>
<p>The Apadāna verses regarding this Thera 
quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary are, in the Apadāna itself (i.152f), 
attributed to an Elder named Maggasaññaka, with whom he is evidently to be 
identified. Five kappas ago he became king twelve times under the name of 
Sacakkhu. v.l. Ekadhammika.</p>

<p><b>2. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.</b>-An arahant. 
In the time of Padumuttara he was a Jatila of great power. Once when journeying 
through the air he found his progress suddenly stopped and, on investigation, 
discovered that below him, on the ground, the Buddha was preaching. He listened 
to the sermon, which dealt with impermanence, and, returning to his hermitage, 
meditated on this topic. Later he was born in Tāvatimsa. Fifty-one times he 
reigned as king of heaven for thirty thousand kappas and twenty-one times he was 
king of men. In this last life he heard a monk in his father’s house preaching a 
sermon in reference to the impermanence of all component things. At the end of 
the sermon he remembered his former attainments and, seated there, reached 
arahantship. He was only seven years old at the time. Ap.ii.385.</p>
