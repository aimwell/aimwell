<p>See Ambatthala. Geiger thinks (Mhv. 
Trs.264, n.3) that Therambatthala is the name given to the Ambatthalathūpa, 
built (on the Cetiyagiri) by Mahādāthika Mahānāga in memory of Mahinda. 
</p>
<p>But, probably, the whole of this 
locality later came to be referred to by this name, for Therambatthala is 
mentioned (Vsm.155, 375; DhSA 187) as the residence of monks, among them, 
Buddha-Rakkhita and Mahā-Rohanagutta.</p>
