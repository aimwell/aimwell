<p>A class of mythical birds generally 
mentioned in company with <a href="naaga.htm" title="n/naaga.htm">NÄgas</a> (E.g., J.iv.181, 202). </p>
<p>They live in Simbali-groves 
(E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty 
leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397). The flapping of their wings can raise a 
storm, known as the Garuda-wind (J.v.77). This wind can plunge a whole city in 
darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188). </p>
<p>A Garula has 
strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its 
roots (J.vi.177). The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the NÄgas (J.ii.13; 
iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where NÄgas 
are to be found. The greatest happiness of the NÄgas is to be free from the 
attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463). A Garulaâ€™s plumage is so thick that a man â€” 
e.g., <a href="n2_ny.htm#Natakuvera" title="n/n2_ny.htm#Natakuvera">Natakuvera</a> (J.iii.91) â€” could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird. Sometimes 
Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with 
kings of <a href="baranasi.htm" title="b/baranasi.htm">Benares</a> and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to 
the Garula city â€” one of the queens being <a href="sussondii_jat_360.htm" title="s/sussondii_jat_360.htm">SussondÄ«</a> (J.iii.187) and the other 
<a href="kaakaatii_jat_327.htm" title="ka/kaakaatii_jat_327.htm">KÄkÄtÄ«</a> (J.iii.91). In each case the queen, being found unfaithful to her Garula 
lover, was returned to her husband. The Garulas know the Ä€lambÄyana spell, which 
no NÄga can resist (J.vi.178, 184). It is said that in olden days the Garulas 
did not know how to seize NÄgas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and 
the NÄgas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the 
ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them. 
Later the Garulas learnt this secret through the treachery of the ascetic 
<a href="karambiya.htm" title="ka/karambiya.htm">Karambiya</a>, as related in the <a href="pandara_jat_518.htm" title="pa/pandara_jat_518.htm">Pandara JÄtaka</a> (J.vi.175f). </p>
<p>Garulas are mentioned 
as sometimes leading virtuous lives, keeping the fast and observing the 
precepts. One such was the Garula king mentioned in the Pandara JÄtaka, and 
another, the son of VinÄta, who visited the park of DhanaÃ±jaya Koravya and gave 
a golden garland as present after hearing Vidhurapandita preach (J.vi.261f). </p>
<p>The Garulaâ€™s body was evidently considered to be specially formed for quick flight, 
for the ancient proto-type of the aeroplane was based on the Garula 
(DhA.iii.135). One of the five guards appointed by Sakka to protect TÄvatimsa 
from the Asuras was formed of Garulas (J.i.204). </p>
<p>The <a href="bodhisatta.htm" title="b/bodhisatta.htm">Bodhisatta</a> (J.iii.187) and
<a href="saariputta.htm" title="sa/saariputta.htm">SÄriputta</a> (J.iii.400) were both, on different occasions, born as Garula kings. 
The SimbalÄ« is the special tree of the Garula-world (Vsm.i.206). The Garula is 
often represented in art as a winged Man. (See Fergusson: Tree and Serpent 
Worship, pl.xxvi.1; xxviii.1. etc.; also Gründwedel: Buddhistische Kunst, 
pp.47-50). </p>
<p>The Garulas are sometimes called
