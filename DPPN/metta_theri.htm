<p>She belonged to a Sākyan family of Kapilavatthu and 
renounced the world with Pajāpatī Gotamī, gaining arahantship in due course.</p>
<p>Ninety one kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, she 
was one of the wives of Bandhumā, king of Bandhumatī, and, pleased with a 
certain nun, entertained her to a meal and gave her a pair of very costly robes 
(Thig.31f.; ThigA.36f).</p>
<p>She is probably identical with Ekapindadāyikā of the 
Apadāna. Ap.ii.515f.</p>
