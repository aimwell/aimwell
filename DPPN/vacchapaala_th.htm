<p>An arahant. He belonged to a rich brahmin family of 
Rājagaha. He witnessed the miracles performed by Uruvela Kassapa and his self 
submission to the Buddha when they visited Bimbisāra together, and marvelling 
thereat, entered the Order. Within a week he developed insight and became an 
arahant.</p>
<p>In the past he had been a brahmin, expert in brahmin lore, 
and one day, while seeking a suitable person to whom he might give a large 
vessel of milk rice left over from the sacrifice, he saw Vipassī Buddha and 
offered it to him. Forty one kappas ago he became a king named Buddha (Thag.71; 
ThagA.i.159f). He is probably identical with Pāyāsadāyaka of the Apadāna. 
Ap.i.157.</p>
