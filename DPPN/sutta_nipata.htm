  <h2>Sutta Nipāta</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the books, generally the fifth, of the Khuddaka 
Nikāya. It consists of five Vaggas — Uraga, Cūla, Mahā, Atthaka and Pārāyana — 
the first four consisting of fifty four short lyrics, while the fifth contains 
sixteen suttas. Of the thirty eight poems in the first three cantos, six are 
found in other books of the canon, showing that they had probably existed 
separately, as popular poems, before being incorporated in the Sutta Nipāta. The 
fourth canto is referred to in the Samyutta Nikaya, the Vinaya Pitaka and the 
Udāna, as a separate work, and this canto was probably very closely associated 
with the last, because the Niddesa is obviously an old Commentary on them and 
takes no notice of the remaining cantos. (For a detailed account see Law, Pāli 
Literature i.232f.)</p>
<p>The Dīghabhānakas included the Sutta Nipāta in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka (DA.i.15).</p>
<p>A Commentary exists on the Sutta Nipāta, written by 
Buddhaghosa, and called the Paramatthajotikā (q.v.).</p>
