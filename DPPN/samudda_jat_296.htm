  <h2>Samudda Jātaka (No. 296)</h2>

<p>The Bodhisatta was once a sea spirit, and heard a water 
crow flying about, trying to check shoals of fish and flocks of birds, saying, 
“Don't drink too much sea water, be careful of emptying the sea.” The sea 
spirit, seeing his greediness, assumed a terrible shape and frightened him away.</p>
<p>The story was related in reference to the great greediness 
of Upananda the Sākyan (q.v.). He is identified with the water crow. J.ii.441f.</p>
