<p>King of Ceylon (1604-35 A.D.). He was the cousin and 
successor of Vimaladhammasūriya I. and had his capital at Sirivaddhanapura. 
Because the Parangī (Portuguese) did much damage to Buddhism, he removed the 
Tooth Relic to Pañcasata. He had three sons: Kumārasīha, Vijayapāla, and the 
best known of all, Rājasīha (afterwards Rājasīha II.). He divided the country 
among his sons seven years before his death. Cv.xcv.1ff.</p>
