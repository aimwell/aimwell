<p><b>1. Kālasilā.</b>-The black rock by the side 
of <a href="isigili.htm" title="i_/isigili.htm">Isigili</a> (Isigilipasse).  </p>
<p>It was there that 
<a href="maha_moggallana_th.htm" title="maha/maha_moggallana_th.htm">Moggallāna</a> was murdered (J.v.125f; 
DhA.iii.65f; ApA.i.206) and that <a href="godhika_th.htm" title="g/godhika_th.htm">Godhika</a> (S.i.120f; DhA.i.431f ) and 
<a href="vakkali.htm" title="va/vakkali.htm">Vakkali</a> 
(S.iii.124) committed suicide.  </p>
<p>It was a lonely spot, and we are told that when 
monks came from afar to <a href="raajagaha.htm" title="r/raajagaha.htm">Rājagaha</a> they would ask
<a href="dabba_mallaputta_th.htm" title="d/dabba_mallaputta_th.htm">Dabba Mallaputta</a> to find them 
lodgings there because they wished to see evidence of Dabba’s iddhi-powers 
(Vin.ii.76; iii.159).  </p>
<p>The <a href="buddha.htm" title="b/buddha.htm">Buddha</a> is mentioned (S.i.194) as having stayed at Kālasilā with a great company of monks. On one such occasion the Buddha is said 
to have given <a href="aananda.htm" title="aa/aĀnanda.htm">Ānanda</a> an opportunity of asking him to continue to live for a 
whole aeon. But Ānanda failed to do so (D.ii.116). </p>
<p>The Buddha is elsewhere 
(ThagA.ii.209) described as residing at Kālasilā with five hundred monks, all of 
whom were arahants. Moggallāna discovered their powers, and thus earned the 
praise of <a href="vangiisa_thera.htm" title="va/vangiisa_thera.htm">Vangīsa</a>.</p>
<p>The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.229) 
speaks of a Kālasilāvihāra.  </p>
<p>In the
<a href="cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s.htm" title="c/cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s.htm">Cūladukkhakkhandha Sutta</a> (M.i.92), it is said 
that Kālasilā was also the residence of some <a href="niganthaa.htm" title="n/niganthaa.htm">Niganthas</a>, followers of Nāthaputta.</p>
