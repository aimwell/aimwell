<p>A family in Rājagaha was afflicted with 
plague and all its members died except one woman. She broke through a wall (that 
being the customary method of avoiding infection) and went and lived in the 
backyard of another house. The inmates of the house, having compassion on her, 
gave her the remnants of their food.  </p>
<p>One day, Mahā Kassapa, rising after seven 
days and nights from nirodha-samāpatti, knowing that he could be of use to the 
poor woman, appeared before her asking for alms. Having nothing but rice-water 
to give him, she asked him to go elsewhere, but the Elder showed his desire to 
accept her gift and refused alms offered to him by Sakka and by the inmates of 
the house behind which the woman lived.  </p>
<p>With great joy she gave him the 
rice-water, and the Elder then told her that three births earlier she had been 
his mother. That same night she died and was born in a vimāna among the 
Nimmānaratī gods.  </p>
<p>Her story forms the basis of the Ācāma-dāyikā-Vimāna Vatthu.
