  <h2>Nagaraka (v.l. Nangaraka)</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Sākyan township near Medatalumpa. From there Pasenadi, 
accompanied by Digha-Kārāyana, paid his last visit to the Buddha, as recorded in 
the Dhammacetiya Sutta. M.ii.118.</p>
<p>The Buddha evidently once stayed in Nagaraka, for in the 
Cūla-Suññatā Sutta, Ānanda is reported as reminding the Buddha that once, while 
staying at Nagaraka, the Buddha had remarked that he lived “with the Void a 
great deal.”</p>
