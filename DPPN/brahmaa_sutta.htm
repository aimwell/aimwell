<p><b>1. Brahmā Sutta.</b> The Buddha is under the 
Ajapālanigrodha, soon after the Enlightenment, pondering on the four 
satipatthānas as the only way to Nibbanā. Sahampati visits him and agrees with 
his sentime<span lang="en-us">nts. S.v.167.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Brahmā Sutta. </b>The scene is the same as in the 
above. The Buddha is reflecting on the five indriyas (saddhā, sati, etc.), as 
the way to Nibbāna, and Sahampati visits him and agrees with him, relating how, 
when he was a monk named Sahaka, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, he developed the 
five indriyas and was born in the Brahma world. S.v.232f.</p>
