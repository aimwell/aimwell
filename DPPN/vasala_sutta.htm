  <h2>Vasala Sutta</h2>

<p>The seventh sutta of the Uragavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. 
It was preached at Sāvatthi to the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja (it is thus also 
called the Aggikabhāradvāja Sutta, SNA.174), who reviled the Buddha, calling him 
outcaste (vasala) when the Buddha went to his house for alms. </p>
<p>The Buddha replied that the brahmin knew neither the 
meaning of vasala, nor what makes a man such. At the request of the brahmin he 
preached this sutta, the burden of which is that it is not by birth that one is 
an outcaste or a brahmana, but by one’s deeds (SN., pp. 21f). The Sutta is also 
included in the Parittas (q.v.).</p>
