<p><b>1. Rahogata Sutta.</b> While in solitude a monk thinks of the three kinds 
of feelings, and, visiting the Buddha, questions him. The Buddha tells him that 
the statement “Whatsoever is experienced is joined with dukkha” is made 
concerning the impermanence of compounded things. The ceasing of activities is 
gradual, so is their mastery. S.iv.216f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Rahogata Suttā.</b> Two Suttas. Moggallāna visits Anuruddha, as the 
latter is meditating in solitude in Jetavana, and asks for details as to how a 
monk should practice the four satipatthānas. Anuruddha explains. S.v.294ff.</p>
