<p><b>1. Madhura Sutta. </b>Avantiputta, king of Madhurā, visits Mahā Kaccāna, who is 
staying at the Gundāvana in Madhurā, some time after the Buddha’s death, and 
questions him regarding the brahmin claims to superiority over other castes. 
Kaccāna points out that wealth confers power on all, not only on brahmins. A 
brahmin experiences the result of his actions both good and bad, in this world 
and in the next, just as do members of other castes. A brahmin ascetic receives 
no more homage than an ascetic of other castes. Avantiputta accepts the Buddha’s 
Faith. M.ii.83 90; cp. Ambattha Sutta; for a discussion see Dial.i.105.</p>

<p><b>2. Madhura Sutta. </b>On the five disadvantages of Madhurā: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the ground is uneven, </li>
  <li>there is much dust, </li>
  <li>there are fierce dogs and </li>
  <li>bestial yakkhas, and </li>
  <li>alms are obtained with difficulty (A.iii.256). 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The Commentary explains (AA.ii.646) that the Buddha, 
during a tour, once entered Madhurā, and was on his way to the inner city. But a 
certain heretic yakkhinī stood before him naked, stretching out her arms, her 
tongue out. The Buddha thereupon turned back and went to the vihāra, where the 
people entertained him and the monks.</p>
