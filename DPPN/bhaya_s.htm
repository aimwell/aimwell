<p><b>1. Bhaya Sutta. </b>There are three terrors that part mother and son: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a great fire, </li>
  <li>a great flood, and </li>
  <li>a raid by robbers. </li>
</ul>
<p>They are also parted by old age, disease, and death.
</p>
<p>The practice of the Noble Eightfold Path will avoid these 
terrors. A.i.178 f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>2. Bhaya Sutta. </b>“Fear” is a name for sense desires; likewise “pain,” 
“disease,” “blain,” “bondage” and “bog.” </p>
<p>Impassioned by the senses and bound by them, both in this 
world and in the next, men are subject to fear, etc. A.iii.310f.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>3. Bhaya Sutta</b>. The same as No.2, with the 
  addition of “womb” to the list. A.iii.311.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>4. Bhaya Sutta</b>. There are four fears: birth, old 
  age, disease, and death. A.ii.121.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>5. Bhaya Sutta</b>. Four other fears: fire, water, 
  kings, bandits. A.ii.121.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6. Bhaya or Bhikkhu</b><b> 
  Sutta</b>. In the Ariyan disciple the five kinds of guilty dread are allayed; 
  he is possessed by the four limbs of sotāpanna, and the Ariyan method is, by 
  him, well seen and penetrated by insight. S.v.389.</p>
