<p>The Bodhisatta was once a very skilled 
acrobat and travelled about with his teacher who knew the dance of the four 
javelins. One day the teacher, in a drunken fit of boasting, announced that he 
would do the dance of the five javelins — which he did not know — and insisted 
on doing it against the advice of the Bodhisatta. The result was that the 
boaster was impaled on the fifth javelin (J.i.430f). For the introductory story 
see the Gijjha Jātaka (No.42).</p>
