After that one must cultivate bodhicitta and strive for the highest goal, which is the Omniscience of a Sammāsambuddha. Even 
Arahants like Venerable Sāriputta, the Mānayānists regard as inferior to others. The Arahants, they say, have only practised for their own benefit, and are ultimately of no benefit to others. The special esoteric teachings of this school preserved only in Sanskrit, were taught by the Buddha for only those especially intelligent ones who had the capacity to understand it. The teachings in the five Nikāyas, the Vinaya, and the Abhidhamma were just the basics for the less intelligent. </FONT>

The Buddha praised Arahantship as the highest goal. Those who achieve it are worthy of the greatest homage. The very meaning of the term <I>“Araham”</I> means “worthy.” Offering a spoonful of almsfood to an Arahant is a highly meritorious deed that leads to great benefits for the giver, so what can be said for paying reverential homage, providing a dwelling place for, or studying the Dhamma under such a pure-hearted individual?</FONT>

They know very little of the great breadth and depth of the Buddha’s teachings. They know about respiration meditation, as that is mentioned first in the Satipatthāna Sutta, but they think that that is the only teaching in the Satipatthāna Sutta.

Do Buddhists believe in God?</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It depends on what you mean by God. If you mean a supreme and almighty being who created the world and all the beings in it, and who decides the destiny of those beings after death, then Buddhists do not believe in any such God. However, if you believe that there must be something 
that transcends the material realm of the senses, something eternal and real that can be personally realised, and that transforms the lives of those who realise it, then Buddhists do believe in such a reality. It is called nibbāna.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="A2"></A>2. Why is Buddhism so negative and pessimistic?</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Buddhism talks a lot about suffering and impermanence because living beings are very strongly attached to life and to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. It is this attachment and enjoyment that is the cause of suffering. If one follows the Buddhist path, attachment is gradually reduced and finally eradicated altogether. The complete absence of attachment is the highst possible bliss. Even a little less attachment means less 
suffering, so Buddhism is a path of joy and liberation from pain, dissapointment, grief and despair. It is not pessimistic at all.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="A3"></A>3. If there is no soul, what is reborn?</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The idea of a self, person, me, or you is a misperception or illusion. There is a continuous 
chain of cause and effect throughout life, and this process does not come to an abrupt halt after death. Because the process is continuous, we perceive it as a fixed reality — as a person or soul. However, not one thought or one atom is permanent; everything is in a constant flux. The self is not destroyed by realising nibbāna, because the self is a non-existent thing. What is destroyed is the illusion of self. When the illusion is shattered, all doubts will disappear. See </FONT><A

Monks and nuns make a full-time commitment to the practice and study of the Dhamma, hopefully because they have strong faith in the Buddha’s teaching. A layperson can also have strong faith in the Dhamma, but 
due to social responsibilities may be unable to follow the monastic life-style.

Why Are Buddhists Not Always Vegetarians?</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A lay Buddhist can make a free choice what 
he or she eats. A monk or nun has fewer options, and usually has to make do with what is offered. As long as one does not kill, urge to kill, rejoice in killing, nor speak in praise of it, one can buy and eat meat. The kamma depends on one’s intention. Those who kill or trade in animals to make a living will inherit their bad kamma. It is a wrong livelihood for a Buddhist, but not everyone in the world is a Buddhist. Even so, some Buddhists may be fishermen or may raise livestock. Growing 
fruit and vegetables nearly always involves the deliberate destruction of many living beings too. Not everyone can afford pure organic produce.

However, believing is one thing; knowing and seeing by means of psychic powers is far more difficult. The Buddha and his leading disciples had psychic powers so they could converse with celestial beings or see the evil-doers suffering in hell or as hungry ghosts due to their evil deeds. “Seeing 
is believing” as they say. If you cannot see, then you must believe. You don’t have to believe if you don’t wish to, as it is prudent not to accept anything on hearsay, but if you dismiss heaven and hell as mere allegories for pleasure and pain, then you would find this hard to justify from the Buddhist texts.

If one drives carelessly and has a road accident one may end up 
disabled. However, some people are born with physical or mental disabilities, and some get killed or injured due to the carelessness of others. In such cases we must assume that the cause lies with the victim’s past kamma. It does not follow that careless or drunken drivers should not be prosecuted if they accidentally injure someone. Even though they had no intention to cause an accident, carelessness is blameworthy, Killing someone by recklessness is not murder, but it may be 
manslaughter, and should be punished severely. The likely result of such reckless or negligent behaviour is that at some point in the future one will suffer a similar fate, and be killed or injured through no fault of one’s own.

However, killing is always justifiable (sic). Even the terrorist can justify, at least to himself or herself, why he or she 
has to murder dozens of innocent civilians. If one were undeluded and totally mindful, there is no way that one could kill any living being. However, human beings are seldom undeluded, and rarely mindful, so they can always justify killing: “If I don’t kill the mosquitos I will get malaria,” or “If I don’t carry out this abortion, the mother may kill herself, or the baby will have a miserable existence as an unwanted child,” or “If we don’t execute this murderer he will kill 
many more people.” All such justifications make false assumptions based on one’s conditioning, which is nothing but the unskilful mental attitude of aversion, ill-will, or anger. Killing and anger is always justifiable, and only part of being human, but that doesn’t  make it right.

Everyone could easily gain enlightenment and only the wicked 
or foolish would have to suffer. Even within Buddhism there are many false teachings that are not the true teaching of the Buddha. Please forget about sectarian arguments. In the time of the Buddha there were no different sects, but there were still some who practised rightly and gained the goal, and some who practised wrongly. After the Buddha’s passing away, one monk suggested that the monks could now do as they wished without being constantly admonished by the Teacher. Spurred by this 
comment, Mahākassapa convened the First Buddhist Council to rehearse the Dhamma/Vinaya in order to preserve it for future generations. A hundred years later, some monks started accepting and using money, eating after midday, and followed a number of other unorthodox practices. The Second Council was convened and the true Dhamma/Vinaya was again agreed upon and restated. A few hundred years later, in the time of Emperor Asoka, the Third Council was convened because unorthodox practices and 
wrong views had again become prevalent. It was at this time that the Mahāyāna started to develop as some monks split away from the orthodox monks. Never mind about this sect or that tradition, just try to learn properly what is Dhamma/Vinaya and what is not Dhamma/not Vinaya, i.e. try to know and practise what the Buddha taught and disregard what the Buddha did not teach or practice.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A

He was completely free from jealousy and ill-will. However, he certainly did say some things that were displeasing to others. When he started teaching the Dhamma, the Brahmins were well-established as the “Church” of the day. They held that the Brahmins or priests were a 
superior caste to workers, farmers, merchants, and nobles. The Buddha ridiculed them in many ways, both in private with his loyal disciples and in public when non-believers were present. They lost most of their support, and conspired to discredit the Buddha by hiring a prostitute to pretend she had had an affair with him, then hiring some thugs to murder her.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha also criticised 
evil-doers among his own followers and constantly admonished his loyal disciples not to be heedless. He said, “Ānanda, I will not treat you [gently] as a potter treats an unbaked pot.

What is equal between men and women is their ability to understand and

Effort should be constant, continuous, and resolute. However, it must be balanced with tranquillity. One

the time of the Buddha, wicked and lazy monks (and nuns) have been trying to find an easier route to nibbāna. It is only human nature. The rules were made to keep weaker disciples on track, not to make their lives more difficult. Those who refuse to follow the training rules as laid down by the Buddha have blocked their own spiritual progress. In the introduction to the Pātimokkha, which should be recited every fortnight wherever four monks reside together, it is said, “Whatever monk has 
committed an offence, but does not disclose it, is guilty of deliberate lying, which is obstructive to spiritual progress.” One cannot separate Dhamma from Vinaya. A lay person must fully observe the five precepts to make progress, and a monk must fully observe 227 precepts. If one admits one’s faults and strives to overcome one’s limitations, one can progress. Otherwise, one cannot. See </FONT><A HREF="../Books/Pesala/Heart/heart.html"><FONT SIZE="-1"

never appeased by hatred, and harsh words lead to quarrels, even to the exchange of blows. Buddhists can resort to the law to defend their property rights or reputation. If one kills or injures others while retaliating in self-defence the kamma will depend on one’s intention.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The period between the Second Council and the first century B.C.E. saw the growth of Mahāyāna literature in India and the emergence of a number of important texts. The first to appear were transitional works like the Lalitavistara and Mahavastu, which belong to derivative schools of the Mahasanghikas and describe the career of the Buddha in exalted, supramundane terms. These were followed by more 
than a hundred definitive Mahayana sutras, like the former, composed in Sanskrit and hybrid Sanskrit. Most of these sutras are quite extensive; examples include the Lotus Sutra, the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in eight thousand lines, the Samadhiraja Sutra, and the Lankavatara Sutra. They make liberal use of parables and examples and put forward the major themes of the Mahayana tradition in a discursive, didactic way. These ideas were supported some time later by the systematic arguments found 
in the commentarial or exegetical literature, known as shastras, composed by outstanding figures like Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Vasubandhu.</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Mahāyāna Sutras were never spoken by the Buddha, but were composed at a later date by shameless monks. To put one's own words into the mouth of the Buddha is heresy. Those who write or repeat such sutras slander the Tathāgata by saying that he 
taught what he did not teach. They mislead all who listen to them, and create serious obstructive kamma preventing their own realisation of the Dhamma. By promoting a false teaching they reject the original teachings of the Buddha and work for the disappearance of the true Dhamma. Those who originally composed these sutras were guilty of a serious crime for which they must now still be suffering in hell.</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
