<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>autoreply: a safe, rate limited autoresponder</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
autoreply is a simple autoresponder useful for replying to
email upon receipt.

<P>
<H2>Features</H2>

<P>
autoreply has been designed to be used safely without supervision.
It remembers who it has replied to recently, has a list of addresses
that it will not respond to (MAILER-DAEMON, majordomo, listserv, etc),
and examines headers checking for mailing lists.

<P>
In case these features are insufficient autoreply also has a rate
limit, and will not send more than a specified amount of mail in
a given time.  The rate and interval are configurable.

<P>
<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>
The 1.2 release is available as a gzip'd tar archive containing
the source and a FreeBSD-2.2.7 binary.  Download this from:

<A HREF="http://www.nemeton.com.au/sw/autoreply/autoreply-1.2.tar.gz">http://www.nemeton.com.au/sw/autoreply/autoreply-1.2.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
To unpack the software on a system with GNU tar (such as FreeBSD):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>tar zxvf autoreply-1.2.tar.gz</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
On a system without GNU tar:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>gzip -dc autoreply-1.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
On a non-FreeBSD system the program will have to be compiled.
This can be done by typing &quot;make clean&quot; and then
&quot;make&quot;.

On a FreeBSD system the binary may be used in its current location
or moved, as preferred.

<P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>

<P>
<H3>reply message format</H3>

<P>
The text file that will be sent should contain mail headers,
particularly a &quot;<TT>From: </TT>&quot; line.

<P>
If the <TT>-s</TT> option is used a &quot;Subject: &quot;
line should not be supplied in the text file.

<P>

<P>
<H3>configuring with qmail or mdforward</H3>

<P>
Choose an address for testing, and in its control file place
directions similar to the following.  Don't forget to deliver
the incoming mail somewhere in addition to the autoreply
command!

<BR>
<PRE>
| /home/user/autoreply-1.2/autoreply /home/user/autoreply-message
/var/mail/user
</PRE>

<P>
(Change the pathnames to suit your installation.)

<P>
<H3>configuring with .forward</H3>

<P>
The format from a sendmail .forward file is similar, but should
should have double quotes around it:

<BR>
<PRE>
&quot;| /home/user/autoreply-1.2/autoreply /home/user/autoreply-message&quot;
\user
</PRE>

<P>
<H3>configuring with procmail</H3>

<P>
The following procmail receipe will pass incoming mail to autoreply.
The &quot;c&quot; is required or the mail will be considered
&quot;delivered&quot; and further receipes will not be used.
