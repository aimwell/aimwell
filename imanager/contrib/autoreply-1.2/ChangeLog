	* Temporary failure for qmail is 111, not 75.  What was
	I thinking of?

1999-05-19  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

        * use EX_UNAVAILABLE instead of EX_OSERR for permanent errors
	under sendmail.  EX_OSERR isn't permanent.  Whoops.

1999-05-01  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* updated the html file for release 1.0

	* 1.0 released

1999-04-05  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* changed chdir() to $HOME to be before option
	parsing, so that relative pathnames works for the log
	file (should be OK anyway under mdforward and qmail,
	but gotta look after it sometimes for sendmail)
	
	* 1.0beta released

	* Change option 'r' to option 'c' which is easier
	to describe in the manual page as 'count'

	* write manual page

1999-04-04  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* Really get the detection of sendmail, qmail and postfix right.
	Note update to mdforward-1.2 to define $MDFORWARD to the name of
	the MTA.

1999-04-03  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* Add compile time option NEVER_BOUNCE.  Defaults to off.

1999-03-30  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* Add RFC2369 List-* headers to blocklist.

	* Tidy up some more unnecessary code; readline() is guaranteed to
	strip the trailing \n.

1999-02-38  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>	

	* Use subject prefix for subject line even if there is no subject
	in the input message.

	* Copy any Message-ID to References.

	* Use Message-ID in log messages if it is known.  Call
	check_headers() before check_sender() so that the message-id is
	found as early as possible.

1999-03-27  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>
	
	* Use fcntl() locking instead of flock(), since fcntl() can have a
	timeout set.

	* Remove -f option, -I and -v.  Vacation mode can come back later.

	* If chdir($HOME) fails, exit with a temporary error at once.
	We're unlikley to be able to get to the log and history files so
	get out while the going is good.

	* Switched logic of zero return code from strbegin() and
	streend().

	* Ripped lots of code out, swapped what remained from using read()
	and write() to stdio, since we're using stdio anyway.  Fixed the
	bugs I saw along the way. The code is much smaller now, which is
	good.

1999-03-25  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* 1.0alpha3 released

	* Remove "Delivered-To: " header since I told people this was done
	on alpha2.  As my current code didn't nearly match what alpha2 or
	even compile did this change and release on a branch.

1999-03-06  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>
	
	* Fix off-by-one where the last(?) entry in the history file would
	be ignored.

	* Add -v and -I options for vacation mode.  Reponses to mailing
	lists will only be suppressed via Precedence headers, unlike
	vacation(1) autoreply doesn't parse the headers for To: or Cc:.
	This might be added later, but will cause Bcc:'d messages to fail,
	so the best answer isn't clear.

1999-03-13  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* 1.0alpha2 released

	* Corrected option parsing for history and interval.
	
1999-01-18  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>
	
	* Add chdir() to $HOME, since sendmail won't do that reliably for
	us.  Without this relative paths specified for the log, history,
	or mail files may fail.

1999-01-16  Giles Lean  <giles@nemeton.com.au>

	* 1.0alpha released
