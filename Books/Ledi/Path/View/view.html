 • Properties such as elephants, horses, vehicles, cattle, fields, buildings, gold, silver, jewels, etc., can be said to belong to us in the present existence. However, when we pass away they do not accompany us beyond death. They are like properties that we borrow for some time. They are liable to destruction during the present existence. As such property does not accompany beings to new existences, it cannot truly be said to belong to them. The Buddha therefore said, <I>“Sabbe sattā kammassakā </I>— 
All beings are owners of their actions.” The only property that accompanies all beings is their own volitional actions. Only the mental, verbal, and physical volitional actions of beings always accompany them in this and future existences.

including almsgiving, fastday observance, conduct, practising meditation, taking refuge in and paying respects to the Three Gems: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, are known as good kamma done in this present life with a view to ripening in future existences and to being reborn in a good abode.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If any one of the ten kinds of immoral conduct be performed, whether for ripening in this existence or 
in the future, that kamma leads one to the lower planes in future existences. So it is known as bad kamma ripening in future existence. In this way one should differentiate between the good and bad kammas and contemplate all the three kinds of kammas, which are performed everywhere, on land, in water, and in the sky.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Having seen the three kammas performed in this world, we can also 
comprehend that all beings, on land, in water, and in the sky, have been performing these three kammas in their past existences of endless worldcycles and will also perform them in the future. Like this universe, there are in the four directions, infinite universes in which all beings in water, on land, and in the sky are performing these three kammas.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Having discerned this, it is 
self-evident that all beings live by these three kammas done by themselves. They enjoy happiness by virtue of these three kammas. By performing the three good kammas they enjoy various beneficial results, and by performing the three bad kammas they encounter various kinds of misery and suffering. The three kammas are their own property, which can never be destroyed by fire, water, thieves, robbers, and so forth. Though one may own nothing, not even a single coin, he can achieve happiness if 
he has mental kamma in the form of knowledge and wisdom. So the Buddha declared: “All beings have kamma as their own property.”</FONT></P><UL><H5 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Result of Present Kamma</FONT></B></H5></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who wish to acquire worldly gains, such as wealth, governmental standing, and honour in 
this life, can achieve their wish if they exert themselves to acquire education and knowledge, If it be that such worldly gains can be had without acquiring education and knowledge and by merely worshipping God, the believers in God need not perform physical, verbal, and mental kammas such as trading, farming, learning arts and sciences. Instead, they need to perform only the act of worshipping God. However, it is not so. Like Buddhists, the Christians, Mohammedans, and others, are performing 
the three kinds of kamma, and so they acquire worldly gains. It is not God, but the three kinds of kamma that gave these to them.</FONT></P><UL><H5 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Result of Past Kamma</FONT></B></H5></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Just as we can see that in this life worldly gains are not given by God, but are acquired by one’s 
own kamma, similarly we can realise that beneficial results of being reborn in a wealthy family or in the deva world are not by virtue of worshipping God, but by virtue of past kamma such as almsgiving, observance of morality and so forth, performed in previous existences. One who is reborn in a wealthy family becomes the owner of the riches of that family. That is, all his possessions are due to his past kamma. Here, the analogy of vegetation should be given.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The process of the formation and growth of vegetation is commonly ascribed to the seed. According to the Abhidhamma, the element of kinetic energy <I>(tejo),</I> which is known as caloricity <I>(utu)</I> is said to be the cause. The seed is nothing but the element of kinetic energy. That element of kinetic energy is the real seed.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At the beginning of the world, before the existence of seeds, vegetation grew from tejo. Later that vegetation produced fruits and seeds from which trees grew successively.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the same way all beings have kamma as their seeds of becoming: wholesome kamma as almsgiving, morality, etc; and unwholesome kamma as taking others’ lives, 
etc.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The process of becoming as men and animals is due to the past kamma in previous existences. On account of the wholesome kamma, etc., they are reborn as men and devas, and because of the unwholesome volitional kamma they are reborn in four lower worlds: hell, animal world, peta world, and asurakāya world.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Previous vegetation produces seeds from which fresh vegetation arises. Seeds produce trees, and trees produce seeds repeatedly in an eternal cycle of seeds and trees. Similarly, beings have seeds of kamma in their previous existences. From these seeds of kamma new existences appear. Thus beings perform kamma, which in turn gives rise to new becomings repeatedly.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Trees have physical phenomena only. A tree yields many fruits from which many trees are grown. In the case of beings, they have two kinds of phenomena: physical and mental phenomena. Of these two, the mental factor is the chief. One mental factor can produce not more than one new mental factor (i.e. the rebirth-consciousness, <I>patisandhi-viññāna).</I> Therefore, although beings have many seeds of wholesome and unwholesome kamma in one existence, one mental factor of the previous existence, i.e. volition <I>(cetanā)</I> produces in the next existence only one mental factor. Since many new mental factors are not produced, one corporealitygroup of the past existence gives rise to not more than one corporealitygroup in the next becoming.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Earth, water, sun, moon, stars, and so forth, come into existence from the seeds of kinetic energy, which go under the name of caloricity. It is not that they were created by God. Beings such as men, animals, etc., come into new successive existences because of the seeds of their past kamma performed in previous world cycles of existences. Such view is known as Right View. To hold that God creates 
them is wrong view. It is the wrong view of those who, not knowing fully the operative power of kamma and climate, imagine that they were created by God. Thus to help people abandon wrong view, and to rely upon kamma, knowledge, and wisdom, the Buddha said, “All beings are owners of their kamma.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">2. <B>Sabbe sattā kammadāyādā:</B>
 • There are such things as legacies and heirs. These legacies can be called our property only before we die; but when we pass away we have to leave them behind. They do not accompany us to the next existence. They are also liable to be destroyed by fire, water, thieves and robbers before our death, or we may use them up until they are exhausted.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As for the three kinds of kamma performed 
by beings, they remain their property in future existences. They are never destroyed bv fire, etc. For this reason, kamma is said to be the only property inherited by beings. Beings are sure to reap the results of their own kamma in future existences. The wholesome kamma performed by feeding animals and birds can result in a hundred happy existences. The wholesome kamma performed by feeding virtuous monks can give rise to a countless number of happy existences as a man or deva. Giving alms 
worth about a quarter of a kyat in this present life can yield beneficial results worth more than a thousand kyats in future existences. If a person kills an animal, such as a fish, fowl, or pig, he may be killed in more than a thousand future existences.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In this world, if a tiny banyan seed is planted, a big banyan tree will grow up bearing innumerable fruits in more than a thousand years. 
Similarly, if a mango seed or a jackfruit seed is planted, big mango trees and big jackfruit trees will grow and bear more than a hundred thousand fruits for many years.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Thus in the case of trees, a small seed is able to yield more than hundred thousand fruits, leaves, branches and twigs. Similarly, a seed of wholesome kamma such as almsgiving, morality, or meditation practised at one time, 
can yield more than a hundred thousand good results in successive future existences. A seed of unwholesome kamma by killing a living being can yield evil and painful results in numerous following existences.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Banyan seeds, mango seeds, and jackfruit seeds may be compared to the seed of physical, verbal, and mental actions.

twigs may be compared to a seed of kamma that produces many effects in the following successive existences.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If a person performs one kamma, the effects always accompany him in many existences yielding good or bad results at the opportune moments. One can never get rid of that kamma, but one has to enjoy or suffer its results under appropriate circumstances. So the Buddha declared: “All 
beings are the heirs of their kamma.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">3. <B>Sabbe sattā kammayonī:</B>
 • There are several causes for the growth of a banyan tree: the banyan seed, the earth, and the water. Of these causes, the banyan seed is the primary cause; the earth and water are the secondary causes. In the same way, in getting wages by working as a labourer, the present kamma, i.e working as a labourer, is the primary cause. The place for working, the spade, the basket and the employers who pay wages are the secondary causes.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The wholesome past kamma, i.e. almsgiving, morality, and so forth, which enables one to be reborn as a human being, and the unwholesome kamma by killing others, etc., which cause one to be reborn as an animal, are the primary causes similar to the banyan seeds. The parents are the secondary causes, just as the earth and water are for the growth of a banyan tree.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Similarly, with regard to the present good and evil results, one’s own kamma performed in the present existence with knowledge and wisdom, or otherwise, is the primary cause. So also, one’s own wholesome kamma as almsgiving, morality, etc., and unwholesome kamma as killing beings, performed in previous existences, are the primary causes of good and evil results. The parents are not the primary causes, nor is it anything to do

 • There are parents, brothers, sons, relatives, teachers, and friends whom we love and rely upon, but they can be loved and relied upon only for a short period, i.e. before our death. However, one’s own physical, verbal, and mental kamma are constant companions, which accompany one and give happiness and prosperity to one in future existences. So the wholesome kamma alone is one’s real relative or friend, which should be esteemed and relied upon. Therefore, the Buddha declared: “All beings have kamma as their relatives.”</FONT>

 • In this phrase, ‘refuge’ means reliance upon or taking shelter for protection against troubles and dangers. Those who wish to enjoy long life have to rely on food and drink. Food and drink protect people from starvation. Starvation cannot befall those who have sufficient food and drink. Similarly, it is necessary to rely upon doctors and medicine for protection against diseases, and to rely upon weapons for protection against enemies. All kinds of refuge are resorted to for different purposes.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">‘Refuge’ does not mean only worshipping. It also has the meaning of reliance upon and taking shelter or protection, as mentioned above. We take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, teachers and those nobler than us by paying homage to them.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A man without property will soon get into trouble. 
Fearing that trouble, we have to rely upon kamma by doing such work as will give us money and property. Lack of wholesome kamma will lead to the lower worlds where one has to suffer grievously. Fearing such suffering, one has to perform wholesome kamma, which can lead one to be reborn as a man or deva in future existences. The present kamma of working with knowledge and wisdom can save us from danger in the present life, and wholesome kamma such as almsgiving and morality can save us from the 
lower worlds in future.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">We have to rely on the present kamma of working for avoiding dangers in this present existence. We have to rely on wholesome kamma also to avoid suffering in the lower worlds in future existences. The Buddha therefore declared: “All beings have kamma as their own refuge.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Here we should analyse several kinds of refuge. In Buddhism there are four kinds of taking refuge for the future: Taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dhamma, taking refuge in the Sangha, taking refuge in one’s own wholesome kamma.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Likewise, there are four kinds of refuge for sick persons: Refuge in a chief doctor, 
refuge in good medicine, refuge in assistant doctors, refuge in following their directions with confidence.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of the abovementioned four refuges, the chief doctors and the assistants are the refuge of the patient as they are capable of prescribing good and suitable medicines for particular diseases. The medicine is the refuge of the patient in that it can cure him of his disease. The 
patient’s sensible action in following the directions are also his refuge, as without such action on his part the other three refuges would be ineffective for the cure of the disease. So all four together are the real refuge of the patient.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who commit evil deeds and indulge in sensual pleasures resemble sick persons; the Buddha resembles the chief doctor who is expert in curing 
diseases; the monks resemble the assistant doctors; and the Dhamma resembles the medicine. The physical, verbal, and mental wholesome kamma resemble the sensible action of the patient in following the directions. So there are four kinds of refuge in Buddhism. The three refuges of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha exist only during the Buddha Sāsana. They do not exist outside it. However, the refuge in wholesome kamma exists both within and outside the Buddha Sāsana. We can never be free from 
kamma, which is operating all the time in this universe as well as in other innumerable universes.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The teaching “All beings are owners of their kamma” applies to all universes both within and outside the Buddha Sāsana. This is why the refuge of kamma alone, and not the three refuges of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, is dealt with in this discourse. These are the four kinds of refuges 
to rely upon for wise conduct in this existence and for rebirth in happy existences in the future.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>Saranam,</I> usually translated ‘refuge,’ means that which can save, give support or protection. Thus food and drink are the support of beings for a long life. Medicines and a healthy diet are the support for the cure of diseases. Kings or rulers are protection against the danger of dacoits and robbers. Buildings are the refuge for living comfortably and safely. Boats and steamers are for sea and riverine voyages. The earth is for support. Similarly water, fire and air are the supports for respective purposes. In this way there are numerous refuges in this existence. This is the exposition about the different kinds of refuge in Buddhism.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In other religions only one refuge, the refuge of God, is known. So whatever comes into existence or is destroyed is attributed to God. I shall clarify this statement.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In other religions, such as Christianity and Islam, the true meaning of refuge is not understood and the respective followers 
regard God as their only refuge. Since they believe only in one refuge, they take it for granted that the appearance and disappearance of the world and beings are due to the power of God. They believe that God saves those who have faith in him by his supernormal power. With this power he can wash away all sins and evils of beings and give them eternal happiness and eternal life after death. The good and evil results of beings depend on the will of God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">They disbelieve in kamma, thinking that kamma is not the cause of such results. It is most surprising that those who are really performing kamma entirely disregard their own acts. Kamma means physical, verbal, and mental actions of practising the teachings of a particular religion. The auspicious act of baptism, worshipping and praying to God daily, obeying his commandments, etc., are really kamma. These people believe 
that God saves only those who perform such deeds, but not those who do not do so; but they do not realise that such deeds are really kamma.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In those religions also, as in Buddhism, there are four kinds of refuge. In Buddhism they are the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and kamma. But in those religions they are:</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

disregard kamma. Consequently they believe that good and evil, prosperity and ruin, happiness and suffering are created only by God and are not due to any other cause. They do not know that there are various and different causes.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Is it simply by worshipping and praying to God that the poor who desire wealth can get it, or would they get it by the present kamma of working diligently as a 
labourer, farmer, or trader Wealth is not usually obtained by worshipping and praying to God. On the other hand, acquisition of property by performing the present kamma is self-evident. So it is reasonable to believe that acquiring property in this life is due to the present kamma, and has nothing to do with God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">God has no power to give property to anyone. Only the present kamma can do so. 
If God had such power to give wealth, his faithful followers would have no occasion to perform present kamma, they would be enjoying riches given by him; and those who are not his followers would not get any property although they were diligently performing the present kamma. However, it is not so. The devout followers of God have to perform the present kamma in order to acquire wealth and property; and those who are not his followers also can acquire it, if they wish, by performing present 
kamma. For this reason, the acquisition of wealth in this life is the result of the present kamma. It is not the gift of God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Similarly, if one desires education and knowledge, one can get it by performing the present kamma of studying and learning. They cannot, as a rule, be acquired by worshipping God. If one wishes to be a government officer, one will have to study government rules and 
regulations. Government posts cannot, as a rule, be obtained by worshipping and praying to God. Thus we can see with our eyes that all the worldly gains are obtainable only by the power of the present kamma and not by the power of God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The believers in God believe that by worshipping God faithfully they are freed from all their sins and evils. However, as a rule the sick are not cured by 
taking refuge in God only. On the other hand we can see that the present kamma of taking medicine and regulating one’s diet can cure them.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">How surprising it is, therefore, to maintain that one could be freed from the result of sins in the next existence by worshipping God, when even a disease such as ringworm is not usually cured by praying to God in this life. Again, since even trifling 
wealth cannot as a rule be acquired by merely praying to God in this life, is it not surprising to believe that just by praying to God one can go after death to heaven, where one can enjoy a life of eternal bliss.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Having seen that wealth and happiness, not previously attained in this life, are achieved by virtue of present kamma and not by favour of God, we can fully believe that there is no 
other refuge than the present kamma for the acquisition of wealth and happiness in this life. Similarly, we can believe that the attainment of the higher planes of existence after death is also due to wholesome kamma. It has nothing to do with God. God cannot enable one who lacks such wholesome kamma to be reborn in a happy plane of existence. Those who have such kamma can attain the higher states of existences, even though they do not pray to God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

 • They eye of human-beings, gods, and brahmās constantly oppresses and harasses those who are attached to it; so it is most frightful and is the real suffering. In the same way, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind to which human-beings, gods, and brahmās are attached, greatly oppress and harass them. They too are most frightful and are the real suffering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><B>Mode of Oppression:</B>
 • Of these six, the eye oppresses through kammic activities, instability, and suffering. Or, it oppresses through kamma activities, burning up <I>(santāpa),</I> and instability. Or, it oppresses through rebirth, aging, and death. Or, it oppresses or harasses by developing the fires of passion, hatred, delusion, conceit, wrong view, mental defilements and corruptions by stimulating evil deeds such as killing, and by producing the fires of rebirth, aging, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><B>Oppression Through Kamma Activities:</B>
 • Possession of the eyes of men, gods, or brahmās is produced by good deeds done in the past life, without which only the eyes of hell beings, animals, ghosts or demons would come into being instead. Thus the eye of a higher being oppresses that being through the good kamma-activities that created the eye. These same kamma-activities oppress him in the next existence, because he has to protect and sustain them so that he will not lose them. So the eyes of a higher being oppresses him through the kammaactivities that produce suffering. So the eye of a higher being perpetually oppresses him. Because the eye of the higher being does not arise independently of kamma-activities, it is said that the kamma-activities invariably oppress the possessor throughout the beginningless round of rebirths.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><B>Oppression Through Instability:</B>
 • This means oppression by liability to immediate destruction whenever there is a cause for destruction. From the time of conception there is not a single moment — even for a wink of an eye or a flash of lightning — when there is no liability to destruction. And there is always the anxiety caused by impending destruction. When actual destruction comes, the suffering that is experienced is manifold. Thus the eye of a higher being oppresses him through instability.</FONT></P><P

 • Ill of suffering means physical and mental pain. The pain experienced through the existence of the eyes of a hellbeing, ghost, or demon is obvious. When there is mental distress through contact with repulsive objects, or physical pain, there is oppression through ill of suffering. When the eye contracts some disease or whenever there is physical or mental trouble in the preservation and protection of the eye one is oppressed by the ill of suffering. Thus the eye oppresses beings through the ill of suffering.</FONT>
