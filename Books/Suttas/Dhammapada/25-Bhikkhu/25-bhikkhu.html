On being told, he related the 
Kacchapa Jātaka to show that not only in this life, but in a previous life too, Kokālika had come to destruction due to not controlling his tongue. At that time he had been a turtle in a lake that was drying up. Two geese offered to carry him to another lake by holding a stick between their beaks while he held on tightly with his mouth. He agreed to this, but on the way some youths looked up and remarked at the sight of a turtle flying through the sky between two geese. The turtle 
immediately retorted in reply to their remarks, fell to the ground in the courtyard of the king of Benares, and was reborn in hell. The Bodhisatta took the opportunity to preach to the garrulous king on the dangers of being too talkative, and the king heeded his advice. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ Kokālika Sutta, S.i.140, Sn vv 662-683.

Soon afterwards, boils erupted all over his body, steadily growing to the size 
of quinces, when they burst. He died from this disease and was reborn in the Lotus Hell. Brahmā Sahampati approached the Buddha during the night and reported that Kokālika had died and had been reborn in the Lotus Hell, due to having hardened his heart against the Elders Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The following day, the Buddha told the monks about this, and a certain monk asked, “How

The monk asked if it was possible to explain by a simile. The Buddha replied that if there was a wagon-load of sesame seed, and if a man took away a single seed every hundred years, that wagon-load of sesame would be used up before the life-span of the Abudda hell. Twenty times that is the lifespan in the Nirabbuda

The Buddha shook his head and remained standing there. The woman laughed loudly, and the Brahmin looked round to see what the 
reason was. Seeing the Buddha, he scolded his wife, and donated the remainder of the food from his plate to the Buddha, apologising for having consumed half already. The Buddha graciously accepted his offering, saying that even the last spoonful would be suitable.

Sona was the son of Kālī, a devout disciple of the Elder Kaccāna. Although from a very wealthy family, he wished to go forth under the elder. The elder turned down his request two times, saying that the monk’s life was hard. On the third time of asking the elder relented and gave Sona the Going Forth. In that border region it was difficult to find monks, so it was three years before the elder could assemble the ten monks required for the higher ordination. Wishing to see the Buddha, Sona 
sought permission to visit the teacher at Sāvatthi. The elder agreed, and travelled by stages to the Jetavana monastery. When Sona arrived, the Buddha greeted him warmly and arranged a place for him to stay in the Perfumed Chamber. Having spent much of the night meditating on the veranda, Sona finally went to rest in the place arranged for him. In the morning, the Buddha asked him to recite what he had learnt, and Sona recited the Book of the Eights from the Gradual Sayings. The Buddha 
congratulated him on his eloquent recital, saying, “Sādhu” three times, and the deities also applauded. At the same time, 1,200 miles away, Kālī heard the deities applauding, and when the deity in her house told her the reason. Kālī’s body was suffused with the five kinds of joy. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha asked Sona if he needed anything. Sona took this opportunity to convey the request from 
his teacher to permit the higher ordination in the border regions with only five monks, at least one of whom was learned in the Vinaya, and the Buddha granted this request. After staying a few more days with the Teacher, Sona took his leave and returned to his preceptor. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On his return, Sona went for alms with his preceptor to his mother’s house, and Kālī invited Sona to give a public 
discourse.

mansion by digging a tunnel. Their ring-leader sent one thief to observe the woman, with instructions to kill her if she should return before they had finished. The maid servant came and informed Kālī that the thieves were taking the copper coins, but she sent her away saying, “Let the thieves take what they want,” telling her not to disturb her while she was listening to the Dhamma. A second time she came to inform her that they were taking the silver coins, and a third time that they 
were taking the gold coins, but Kālī sent her away telling her not to disturb her again. Hearing from his spies what had happened, the ring-leader was impressed by Kālī’s devotion to the Dhamma. He ordered the robbers to replace all of the stolen property, fearing that they would surely be struck by lightning for robbing such a virtuous woman. They all went to the pavilion and listened to the remainder of the Dhamma talk. They asked for forgiveness from Kālī, and asked her aid to 
obtain the Going Forth from her son. Thus they all became monks, and each having been given a suitable meditation object, went to practise meditation. When they were engaged in meditation, the Buddha projected an image of himself before them and uttered the above verses having considered the temperament of each.

Then he went to the tree and 
admonished himself. The other monks, seeing him go back and forth every few days asked where he was going. He replied that he was going to see his teacher. After some time he gained Arahantship so no longer went to the tree. The monks asked him why he no longer went to see his teacher. He replied that since he had severed his connection with the world he no longer need to see his teacher.

For some time the Buddha said nothing, but when he realised that 
Vakkali’s insight had matured, the Buddha admonished him not to keep gazing at him, saying, “He who sees the Dhamma sees me.” When it was time to enter the Rains at Sāvatthī, the Buddha departed, telling the Elder Vakkali to return to Rājagaha. Unable to bear being separated from the Buddha for three months, Vakkali intended to commit suicide by jumping off Vultures’ Peak. The Buddha projected his image before him, and uttered the above verse. Vakkali overcame his grief and felt 
happy. Then the Buddha spoke again:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Come Vakkali!

the Buddha and the Sangha for seven days. Having done that he made an earnest wish that he too would be the supreme of those with the divine eye in the time of a future Buddha. The Buddha Padumuttara predicted this would come to pass in the time of Buddha Gotama. When the Buddha Padumuttara attained parinibbāna, the youth set up a circle of lights surrounding the cetiya built the honour his remains. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Having been reborn in celestial realms for a long time, he was in due course reborn as a poor worker call Annabhāra (food-carrier) who worked for a generous millionaire named Sumana. One day, Annabhāra came into the divine eye of a Solitary Buddha named Uparittha who, wishing to bestow a blessing on Annabhāra, took his almsbowl and went to stand in front of him. Annabhāra asked him to wait, and going quickly to his house brought 
the food that his wife had prepared for himself. Offering that as alms to the Solitary Buddha he made an earnest wish never again to hear the word <I>“natthi”</I> — “there isn’t any.” The deities applauded his offering and the deity who dwelt in the parasol of the wealthy donor Sumana also applauded. Hearing this applause for the first time, Sumana wondered what the reason was. The deity told him that the applause was not for him but for the alms offered by Annabhāra, one of his workers. Sumana asked Annabhāra to share half of his merit for a thousand gold pieces. Annabhāra went to ask the advice of the Solitary Buddha who told him that by sharing the merit it would be doubled, as a torch-light shared with a hundred other households would only increase the amount of light available to all. Annabhāra accepted the offer of Sumana, who told him to build a house for himself with the money he had received and to take whatever else he needed from his stores. Thus did Annabhāra become a friend of the wealthy donor Sumana.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In due course, Annabhāra was reborn as a cousin of Siddhattha Gotama in the family of Amitodana¹ the Sakyan at Kapilavatthu, and was named Anuruddha. While playing with his friends he repeatedly sent word to his mother to send cakes until at last she decided it was time that he learnt a lesson, so sent back an empty bowl with the message “there isn’t any cake.” Due to the vow made in his 
previous life, the deities filled the bowl with celestial cakes. When Anuruddha returned he asked his mother if she really loved him as she had never before sent such delicious cakes. From then on, whenever Anuruddha asked for cakes, his mother sent an empty bowl and the deities filled it with celestial cakes. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When Anuruddha came of age, his elder brother Mahānāma suggested that one of 
them should go forth as a monk as no one from their family had yet gone forth. Anuruddha thought he would not be able to endure the hard life of a monk, so his brother explained to him the duties of farming. Since Anuruddha had been spoiled so much, he didn’t even know where food came from. While his friend Kimila thought it came from the granary, and his friend Bhaddiya thought it came from the cooking pot, Anuruddha thought it came from a golden bowl, as he had never even seen food 
prepared. Thus, when Mahānāma had explained all the duties of farming, Anuruddha decided that he should go forth and let his brother Mahānāma remain to look after the family’s land. Thus Anuruddha, Kimila, and Bhaddiya, the three royal princes and good friends from childhood, went forth together in the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama.² In due course, Anuruddha gained Arahantship with the threefold knowledges. He remembered his previous life when he had given alms to the Solitary 
Buddha Uparittha. He wondered what had happened to his friend of that time, the wealthy donor Sumana. Reflecting on that he realised that Sumana had been reborn in the market town of Munda in the Viñjha forest as Cūla Sumana, the younger son of a lay disciple named Mahā Munda. Since the Rainy season was near, Anuruddha travelled there through the air using his supernormal powers and alighted at the gate of the town. Seeing the Elder Anuruddha putting on his robe, the lay disciple sent his 
elder son to fetch the elder’ almsbowl and himself prepared a seat for him. Throughout the three months of the Rains, the lay disciple waited devotedly upon the elder, and when the time came for the Pavarana festival, he offered sugar lumps, oil, husked rice, etc. The elder refused, and when asked why, said that he had no novice to attend him. When the lay disciple offered Mahā Sumana as his novice, the elder again refused saying he had no need for Mahā Sumana. Then the lay disciple asked 
the elder to admit Cūla Sumana to the Sangha, and the elder consented. While Sumana’s head was being shaved he attained Arahantship. Having stayed there a further fortnight, the elder took leave and departed with the novice, returning to his forest hut in the Himalayas.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One day when the elder was troubled by indigestion, the novice fetched water from the Anotatta lake. When the elder and 
the novice visited the Buddha, some of the monks treated the novice like a child. Wishing to show the boy’s powers, the Buddha told the Elder Ānanda  to ask the novices to fetch some water from the Anotatta lake to fill a water jar. Only Sumana was able to do this. Praising Sumana for his supernormal powers, the Buddha uttered the above verse.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ The brother of Suddhodana, the father of Siddhattha.
