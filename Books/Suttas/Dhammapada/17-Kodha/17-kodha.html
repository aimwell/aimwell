When the hall was completed the Buddha was invited, and Rohinī swept the hall and set out seats for the Sangha. When the meal was finished, the Buddha asked whose the offering was.

While others were enjoying a holiday, Punna had to work because he was so poor. One day, the Elder Sariputta, who had just arisen from spending seven days in absorption (nirodha samapatti), wished to bestow a blessing on Punna. He 
went to the field where Punna was working and stood there gazing at a bush. Punna cut off a piece to offer tooth-sticks to the elder. Then he took the elder’s water filter and offered him clean water. The elder waited a while until Punna’s wife had set off from home, then walked into the village for alms. Seeing the elder, she paid homage to him and offered the rice she had brought for her husband. The elder covered his bowl when she had given half, but she asked him to let her give it 
all. She then returned home to cook more rice for her husband. Arriving late, she told Punna not to be angry, explaining why she was late. He was pleased. Exhausted from working the whole morning without food, after eating his meal he fell asleep in his wife’s lap. When he woke up, the field that he had ploughed had turned to gold. Thinking that he was hallucinating he rubbed his eyes, and taking some earth, rubbed it on the plough handle. Seeing that it was indeed gold, he filled a basket 
with the earth and went to the king’s palace. He suggested to the king that the gold should be fetched to the palace. The king appointed Punna as his chief treasurer and gave him a site to build a house near the palace. When the house was complete, Punna invited the Buddha for alms, and at the conclusion of the thanksgiving sermon, Punna, his wife, and Uttarā all gained Stream-winning.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The 
treasurer of Rajagaha urged Punna to arrange the marriage of Uttarā to his son, but because he was a heretic, Punna was reluctant to agree. Eventually he relented and the marriage was arranged. Uttarā was miserable in her new home because she had no opportunity to invite the monks or to offer alms. She sent a message to her father who sent her a large sum of money with a message to hire the services of an expensive prostitute named Sirimā for her husband. Thus during the last fortnight of 
the Rains Retreat, Uttarā was free to cook food to offer to the monks. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Wondering what she was up to, her husband looked to see her toiling in the kitchen and laughed. Wondering why he laughed, Sirimā looked and saw Uttarā, and grew jealous. She went to the kitchen, and taking a ladle of boiling ghee, advanced towards Uttarā. Seeing her coming, Uttarā radiated metta towards Sirimā, 
grateful that with her help she had been able to offer alms. When Sirimā threw the boiling ghee on her head, it was as if she had sprinkled cold water. Uttarā’s servants attacked Sirimā, but Uttarā fought them off, and protected her.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sirimā came to her senses, and begged forgiveness from Uttarā.

He escorted him into the house, where the Brahmin’s wife greeted him as her own son. They invited him to come for alms to their house every day, but the Buddha declined saying that it was 
not his custom to do that. So they asked that anyone who invited him should be sent to see them. From that time on, whenever the Buddha was invited, he asked the donor to inform the Brahmin and his wife, and they took food from their own house and went wherever the Buddha was invited. If there was no invitation, they offered alms to the Buddha in their own house. Due to hearing the Dhamma frequently, they soon became Non-returners. By the end of the Rains Retreat they attained Arahantship and 
passed into parinibbana. The people cremated their bodies with great respect and the Buddha attended the funeral. Hearing that the Buddha’s parents had died, a great multitude attended the funeral. When people consoled the Buddha not to grieve, he was not offended, but instead taught the Jarā Sutta beginning with the verse:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Short indeed is this life; one dies within a hundred years,

The Buddha explained that they had attained Arahantship at death and uttered the above verse. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="226"></A>The Diligent Destroy the Defilements</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The defilements of those who are ever vigilant, <BR>who discipline themselves day and night, <BR>

Are they discontented or oppressed by life-long habits?” In the morning, she made a rice cake from the flour, and went to bathe, taking it with her. She met the Buddha on the way and offered the rice cake to him. She reflected, “He will 
probably just give it to a crow or a dog later while he goes to eat delicious food in some king or prince’s house.” Knowing her thoughts, the Buddha looked at the Elder Ananda, who prepared a seat with his robe. The Buddha sat there to eat his meal while Punnā stood and watched.
