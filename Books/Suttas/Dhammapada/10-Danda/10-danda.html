 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the time of the Buddha Kassapa, two monks were close friends. A certain goddess, wishing to test their friendship, created a female form when one of the monks stopped to relieve himself. When the other monk saw her, he accused his friend of breaking his vow of chastity, and refused to have anything more to do with him. The goddess became remorseful and confessed what she had done. The monks made up, but their friendship was never 
so close again. When the goddess died, she was reborn in Avīci hell, and at the time of Gotama Buddha she was reborn as a man, and went forth. Due to that previous evil kamma, wherever he went, the elder was followed by a female phantom, and was known as Kondadhāna Thera.¹</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some monks urged Anāthapindika to drive the monk out of his monastery, but he said the Buddha would know about it. 
The monks said the same to Visākhā, but she gave the same reply. Then they reported the matter to the king, urging him to drive the monk out of his kingdom, lest he should bring reproach on the other monks. The king asked where the elder was staying, and went to make a thorough investigation for himself. Discovering that there was no woman, but just a phantom, the king offered to provide the four requisites for him, as the elder might have difficulty otherwise.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

 The Buddha explained the cause in the distant past and told him to be patient, saying it was better to be silent than to retaliate.

The Elder Moggallāna said, “Friend, it is not the right time to ask this question. Wait until we are in the presence of the Teacher.” After they returned from almsround in Rājagaha, the Buddha confirmed that he had seen that same ghost on the night of his Enlightenment. Asked the reason for his plight, he told this story:</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

On his way to pay his respects one day, he saw a man spattered with mud, and said to himself, “This must be a burglar.” The thief bore a grudge and swore to get even. He burnt his fields seven times, cut off 
the feet of his cattle seven times, and burnt his house seven times, but was still not satisfied. He befriended the millionaire’s servant to find out what Sumangala was most attached to. Learning that it was the Buddha’s dwelling place he had donated, the thief set fire to it while the Buddha was on almsround. When Sumangala learned of this, he felt no more than a tinge of grief, but set to work at once to have it rebuilt, delighting in his good fortune in being able to spend even more in 
donating to the Buddha. When the robber heard about this he decided to kill him, but was unable to get an opportunity for seven days, as the millionaire was waiting upon the community of monks and the Buddha. After seven days, Sumangala said to the Buddha, “Seven times my fields have been burnt, seven times my cattle’s feet have been cut off, and seven times my house has been burnt down, and now the Perfumed Chamber has been burnt down. I make over to that man the first fruits of this 
offering.” When he heard that, the robber felt great remorse, and begged for forgiveness. Sumangala forgave him, and asked him why he had done it. Hearing why, he asked for forgiveness from the robber. The robber asked to be a slave in his house, but Sumangala declined, and let him go his own way. As a result of his evil deed, the robber was born in Avīci hell, and then as the Python ghost on Vulture’s Peak.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"

The thugs surrounded the elder’s dwelling, but he escaped through the keyhole and went his way. For three months they were unable to catch him, but seeing that his past kamma had to give its fruit, the elder made no more attempt to get away. The thugs caught him and tore him limb from limb, 
pulverising his bones into tiny pieces. However, the elder was not dead yet, and wished to pay his final respects to the Buddha, so he used his psyhic powers to reassemble his body, and went to pay homage to the Buddha.

on the branch of a tree and became a monk. It was not long before he became fat and discontented with the monk’s life. Then he went to the tree where he had hung his loincloth and pot, and admonished himself for being so stupid for wanting to go begging in just a loin-cloth. He was content for a while, then again became discontent, so again he went to the tree. The third time this happened, some monks asked him where he was going.

he gained Arahantship.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the monks asked him why he didn’t go to see his teacher any longer he replied that formerly he was attached to the world, so he went to his teacher, but now that he had cut off attachment to the world, he no longer need to go.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The monks reported what he had
