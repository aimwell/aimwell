almsfood in his house. Some bystanders, outraged at what the Brahmin had done, took sticks and clods of earth, and went to the door of his house, determined to kill him. The elder gave his almsbowl to the Brahmin and left his house with him following behind, confronting the hostile crowd that had gathered there. They asked the elder to take his bowl and tell the Brahmin to turn back, as they would know what to do with him. The elder asked them if he had hit them or himself. He said that he

One day, seeing all the people going to the Jetavana monastery bearing gifts, he decided to accompany them. As he listened to the Buddha teach the Dhamma he wished to go forth, and after the discourse sought permission. The Buddha told him to obtain his parents’ permission, which he did. Having gone forth and taken the higher 
ordination, he decided to leave Sāvatthī and stay at Rājagaha. One day, when there was a festival, his parents saw the other young men enjoying themselves, and started weeping, thinking of what their son had given up. A prostitute, seeing them weep, asked what they would do for her if she enticed him to leave the Sangha. They agreed to make her the mistress of the house, and gave her some expenses. The prostitute went to Rājagaha, and bought a house in the street where the elder walked 
for alms. She prepared choice food and offered it to him daily. Then she prepared a seat on the veranda and invited him to eat his meal right there. Next she bribed some boys with cakes, telling them to play and kick up the dust while the elder was eating, and not to stop even when she told them to. She arranged a seat inside the house, and invited the elder to eat inside away from the dust. The following day, she told the boys to make a lot of noise, and arranged for the elder to eat 
upstairs. In this way, she employed all her cunning to seduce the elder, but he was so fond of her food that he didn’t realise what she was up to. Finally, when she started taking her clothes off, he realised his predicament, and was filled with religious emotion.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meanwhile, back in Sāvatthī, the Buddha saw all this and smiled. Seeing him smile, the Elder Ānanda asked him the reason. 
The Buddha told him that a battle was going on between the elder and a prostitute in the city of Rājagaha. When asked who would win, the Buddha said that the elder would win. Then the Buddha projected an image of himself in front of the elder, uttering the above verse. On the conclusion of the verse, the elder gained Arahantship together with the psychic powers, and escaped through the roof of the house, descending at Sāvatthī, where he paid homage to the Buddha.<BR>When the monks were 
discussing these events, the Buddha told them that this was not the first time that he had saved Sundarasamudda when he been enticed by his craving for sweet tastes, in a former life too he had done the same. Then he related the Vātamiga Jātaka (Jā 14).</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="416"></A>A Saint Has Given Up Craving</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1"

When he came of marriageable age Sakka, the king of gods, built him a palace. This was due to his great merit when he built a Perfumed Chamber for the Buddha Vipassī. When King Bimbisāra visited the palace with the young 
prince Ajātasattu, the latter vowed to take it one day. Bimbisāra appointed Jatila as the city treasurer. Jotika became a devout disciple of the Buddha. Later, when Ajātasattu became king, he tried to enter Jotika’s palace while Jotika was visiting the Buddha to listen to Dhamma. The guardian deities drove Ajātasattu away, so he came to Jotika and accused him of hypocrisy. Jotika showed his hands to the king, and challenged him to take the rings from his fingers if he could. Though he 
tried with all his strength, Ajātasattu was unable to remove them. Jotika then held out his hands and let the rings fall onto a cloth. Jotika asked the king’s permission to go forth,¹ and Ajātasattu readily agreed, hoping therefore to get hold of his wealth. As soon as Jotika went forth, his palace disappeared, and his wife returned to Uttarakuru, the celestial realm from whence she had come. When later asked by the monks whether he missed his palace or his wife, the Elder Jotika replied 
that he did not, and the Buddha uttered the same verse as above to show Jotika no longer had any longing for his wealth or his wife. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ The Vinaya proscribes the ordination of those in the king’s service. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="417"></A>A Saint Has Discarded All Bonds</FONT></H3><UL><P

The Brahmins took him all around India and made a good living from his skill. In due course they arrived at Sāvatthī, but the disciples of the Buddha were not impressed by their claims, and they argued. Knowing that the Brahmins and Vangīsa were coming to see him, the Buddha had five skulls arranged in a row and asked 
Vangīsa to divine where the deceased had been reborn. When Vangīsa succeeded in divining the rebirth of each of the first four — in hell, as an animal, a human, a deva — the Buddha praised him. However, the fifth skull was that of an Arahant, and Vangīsa was completely baffled. He asked the Buddha to teach him the mantra with which he would be able to tell the destiny of such persons. The Buddha replied that it could not be taught to one not ordained. With the aim of learning the 
mantra Vangīsa became a monk, and learnt the meditation on the thirty-two body parts. When the Brahmins asked him if he had learnt the mantra yet he told them, “I am learning it.” Before long he attained Arahantship. When the Brahmins asked him if he had learnt the mantra he replied, “I am not able to learn it.” Thinking that he was speaking falsehood, the monks reported this to the Buddha, who confirmed that Vangīsa was skilled in the death and rebirth of living beings, and uttered 
the above verses. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="421"></A>A Saint Yearns For Nothing</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Who has no clinging to aggregates past, present, or future, <BR>Who is without clinging and grasping — I call a Saint.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="-1"
