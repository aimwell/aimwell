He thought, “I have done many evil deeds, I should make merit by offering rice gruel to this monk.” He invited the elder, invited him to sit down on the porch, worshipped him, offered the gruel, and stood fanning 
him. Seeing that the man was famished, the elder told him to eat, and called a man to fan him. Then he taught him the Dhamma. Seeing that he was unable to concentrate due to his remorse, the elder thought, “I will trick him,” and asked him whether he had wished to kill all those people, or whether another had made him do it. He replied that the king made him do it. Then the elder asked, “In that case, what evil have you done?”<SUP>1</SUP> This was sufficient to relieve his guilt, so that he could concentrate on the Dhamma talk. He gained a high stage of insight knowledge (anuloma ñāna), died the same day, and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.

As he had lost his clothes, he covered himself with bark (dāruciriya). The 
locals thought he was an Arahant, and because of their adulation, he soon came to believe it himself.  In a former life, Bāhiya had been one of seven monks who, disenchanted with the corruption in the Sangha, had isolated themselves on a mountain ledge in a do-or-die attempt to attain the goal. The eldest attained Arahantship, and the second monk attained Non-returning, but Bāhiya and</FONT><A HREF="#Notes"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"> the other four monks</FONT></A><FONT

He told him that the true Arahant, the Buddha, was dwelling at Sāvatthi. At once, Bāhiya set off for 
Sāvatthi, and with celestial help, he arrived the following morning, while the Buddha was on his almsround. The monks invited Bāhiya to rest while waiting for the Buddha to return. Bāhiya said that he could not rest without seeing the teacher, as he might die or the Teacher might die before they met, as life was uncertain. He sought out the Buddha and paid homage, taking a firm hold of his ankle, and asked him to teach the Dhamma. Seeing that Bāhiya was not yet quite ready to understand, 
the Buddha declined to teach the Dhamma, saying that it was not the right time as he was on his almsround. Bāhiya requested again, and again the Buddha said it was not the right time. However, when Bāhiya asked a third time, the Buddha saw that Bāhiya’s mind was now equanimous, so he taught him this: </FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Bāhiya, train yourself like this - when you see something, just know that you 
see it; when you hear something, just know that you hear it; when you cognise something, just know that you cognise it; when you know something, just know that you know it. When, Bāhiya, for you in the seen is merely what is seen… in the known is merely the known, then, Bāhiya, you will not be ‘with that.’ When, Bāhiya, you are not ‘with that,’ then, Bāhiya, you will not be ‘in that.’ When, Bāhiya, you are not ‘in that,’ then, Bāhiya, you will be neither here, nor 
beyond, nor in between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma in brief, the mind of Bāhiyadāruciriya was freed from all defilements without remainder.

He told the monks that he had intended to cut his own throat, but instead had cut off his defilements. They thought he was lying and told the Buddha, who said it was true. They asked why the snake 
didn’t bite him, and why he became discontented. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha explained that in a previous life, the snake had been his slave, so it didn’t bite him. (This is how he became known as the Snake-Slave Elder). In a previous life during the time of Buddha Kassapa when he had been a monk for twenty thousand years he had also become discontented. The monks wondered if it was possible to attain 
Arahantship so quickly. The Buddha spoke in praise of energetic striving, saying that it was possible for an energetic monk to achieve Arahantship within the lifting and dropping of the foot, but that a lazy monk could not achieve it within a hundred years.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="113"></A>Realising Impermanence is Best</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1"

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Patācārā was the daughter of a millionaire of Sāvatthi. When she was sixteen she fell in love and ran away with a servant. They lived a simple life in a remote village. When she was pregnant she wished to return to give birth in her family home. Her husband refused, fearing that he would be severely punished. Eventually, she left secretly on her own. He found out, and caught up with her. She gave 
birth on the way, and so turned back. When she became pregnant a second time, all happened as before, but it started to rain. Her husband went to cut wood to build a shelter, but was bitten by a poisonous snake and died. Patācārā waited in vain for her husband to return. 
 She gave birth to her second child, and had to endure the storm the whole night, protecting her children with her own body. In the morning, she found her dead husband. She could do nothing but continue her journey, lamenting her loss. The river Aciravati, which she had to cross, was in flood. Too weak to carry both children across at once, she left her little boy to wait on the bank, and carried her baby across, leaving it on the far bank. When she was halfway back, a hawk flew down to take her baby. She screamed at it, but it was too far away to be scared off. Her elder son, seeing his mother waving her arms, and hearing her shout, thought she was calling him. He jumped into the river, but was swept away by the current.&nbsp; Completely distraught now, she had to continue alone to Sāvatthi. </FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When she arrived near her home, a certain man told her that her family home had been destroyed in the storm, and her parents and only brother had all perished, and were now being cremated. On hearing this, she went completely out of her mind. She lost her clothes, and as she wander naked around Sāvatthi, people pelted her with clods of earth and rubbish.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">She arrived at Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was teaching the Dhamma. When the Buddha addressed her as “sister,” she regained her sanity, and became ashamed of her nakedness. A man threw her his cloak, which she put on. The Buddha listened to the story of her grief, and taught her about the suffering of samsāra, and how relatives are no protection for one still subject to birth and death. As she listened to the Dhamma, 
Patācārā realised nibbāna, gained Stream-winning, and asked to become a nun. From her patient and pleasant demeanour (Patitā cārattā) she became known as Patācārā.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some time later, while she was washing her feet, she noticed how the water flowed away in three stages - some drops of water flowed and subsided close to her, some farther away from her, some still farther away. This 
induced her to meditate on impermanence. The Buddha saw her with his Divine Eye and, projecting himself before her, uttered the above verse: “Though one should live a hundred years not understanding how all things arise and pass away…” At the conclusion of the verse Patācārā attained Arahantship. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="114"></A>Seeing the Deathless is Best</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

A wise man directed her to the Buddha who advised her to collect some mustard seed from a household where none had died. She got mustard seed at every house, but found no household where none had died. The truth gradually dawned upon her. 
When she returned, the Buddha preached the Dhamma, and she became a nun. One day she observed the flickering of a lamp and reflected on the impermanence of life. The Buddha projected his image before her and uttered this stanza comparing life to a flickering lamp. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="115"></A>Realising the Dhamma is Best</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1"
