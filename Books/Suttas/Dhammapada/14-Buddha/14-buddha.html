Many wealthy Brahmins wanted her as a wife, but Māgandiya rejected them all, thinking them not good enough for his daughter. One day, on seeing that Māgandiyā and his wife 
would benefit, the Buddha took his robes and almsbowl and went to the place outside the village where the Brahmin worshipped the sacred fire. On seeing the Buddha, Māgandiya thought, “This man is good enough for my daughter.” He told the Buddha about his beautiful daughter and offered to give her as his wife, asking him to wait there while he went to fetch her. The Buddha said nothing, but left his footprint and went to stand somewhere else. Māgandiya returned with his wife and 
daughter, followed by many people. Māgandiya’s wife read the footprint and said that it was the footprint of someone free from passion. Māgandiya told his wife that she “saw crocodiles even in a drop of water,” and added that the Buddha had already accepted his proposal. She repeated her claim, but he told her to be silent. On seeing the Buddha, the Brahmin approached him and offered his daughter to him. Without saying, “I have no need of your daughter,” the Buddha asked 
Māgandiya to listen to what he had to say, and he consented.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha related the story of his renunciation, his six years of struggle with ascetic practices, his enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi tree, and the attempt to seduce him by the three daughters of Māra.¹ They promised to be his slaves, but he said nothing and did not even look at them. They then tried manifesting in the 
guise of women of different ages and appearances, but to no avail. When the Buddha uttered the above two verses the daughters of Māra vanished.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha concluded by saying to Māgandiya, “Formerly, I had no sexual desire even for the pure bodies of those celestial women. Your daughter’s body is like a vessel full of thirty-two impure things, painted beautifully on the outside. I 
would not touch it even with my foot.” Hearing this discourse, Māgandiya and his wife both gained Non-returning.²</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ They were named “Craving,” “Discontent,” and “Lust” and tried to seduce the Buddha in the fifth week after his enlightenment while he was seated at the root of the Ajapālanigrodha tree. Some say that these are inner conflicts, but in my view they were deities 
of the Paranimmitavasavatī Devaloka where Māra resides. If the former, then how could we explain why the Buddha had thoughts of craving, discontent, or lust after his enlightenment? Māra tried to obstruct the Buddha throughout his life, both before and after his enlightenment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only natural for those addicted to sensual pleasures to oppose those who are not, and who recommend renunciation. Those who have renounced pleasures may still have some lingering desires and 
doubts, but those who have eradicated all desire would have no doubt that being free from craving was blissful, and they would have no trace of hankering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">² Māgandiya’s daughter Māgandiyā, however, conceived a grudge against the Buddha and later plotted to murder Sāmāvatī, who was a devout disciple of the Buddha.

Then he had it set up on strings between bamboo towers over his house and challenged any recluses to take it down with their psychic powers. 
The heretics, who had no powers, pretended that they were too modest to exhibit their powers, and tried various schemes to get it given to them. After a week, the Elders Moggallāna and Pindolabhāradvāja overheard some gamblers talking about the bowl and saying that there were no Arahants in the world. Pindolabhāradvāja urged Moggallāna to take it down. Moggallāna told Pindolabhāradvāja to take it, so the elder used his powers to lift the thirty-mile-wide flat rock to cover the entire 
city of Rājagaha. The people were terrified, so the elder split the rock with his toe, set it back in its rightful place, then descended onto the roof of the millionaire’s house. The man paid homage, had the bowl fetched,&nbsp; and offered almsfood. The Elder returned with the bowl to the monastery. The people pestered him to perform miracles so that there was an uproar at the monastery. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The 
Buddha asked the Elder Ānanda the reason, and then summoned the Elder Pindolabhāradvāja. The Buddha rebuked the Elder Pindolabhāradvāja severely¹ for exhibiting his powers, had the bowl broken up and pounded into paste, then laid down a training rule prohibiting monks from displaying their powers. Hearing of this, the heretics made the most of it, saying that henceforth they would only exhibit their powers together with the Buddha.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">King Bimbisāra told the Buddha about this, and the Buddha said that he had laid down the rule for his disciples, not for himself. He promised to perform a miracle in four months’ time at Sāvatthī on the full moon day of Āsālhī. The heretics knew that they were lost, but followed the Buddha to Sāvatthī saying that he was trying to run away from them. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In due course the Teacher arrived at Sāvatthī. The heretics collected money and built a pavilion where they said they would perform miracles. King Pasenadi approached the Blessed One and offered to make him a pavilion. The Buddha declined, saying that Sakka would make him a pavilion. On being asked where he would perform a miracle the Buddha said that he would do it at the foot of the Kanda mango tree. The heretics had every mango 
tree for miles around uprooted. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On the day of the full moon the Teacher walked for alms, and Kanda the king’s gardener offered him a mango. The Elder Ānanda made a mango drink for the Teacher, and after his meal the Teacher asked Kanda to plant the mango seed right there. When the teacher washed his hand and poured the rinsing water onto that spot, a mango tree fifty cubits high sprang 
up right away fully laden with fruit. The monks ate their fill, and other men came to enjoy the fruit, throwing some at the heretics, blaming them for destroying all the mango trees in the district. Then Sakka ordered the wind god to blow, scattering the heretics’ pavilion, covering them with dust until they looked like red ants, and they fled in all directions. Purāna Kassapa committed suicide by drowning himself in the river and was reborn in Avīci hell.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sakka created a jewelled walking path in the sky stretching from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. By the time that the shadows of evening had lengthened, a huge crowd had assembled. The Teacher came out of his perfumed chamber and stood on the terrace. Then Gharanī, a female lay disciple, asked permission to perform a miracle, but the Teacher declined her offer. Other lay disciples, novices, nuns, and monks did 
likewise, up to the Elder Moggallāna, but the Teacher, after acknowledging their ability, declined all of their offers saying that this basket of flowers was prepared only for him, and that no one else could bear this burden. Then the Teacher stepped onto the jewelled walking path and, pacing up and down, performed the Twin Miracle, emitting streams of fire and water simultaneously from each pore of his body. Then as he paced up and down he taught the Dhamma to the assembly, and seeing no 
one able to ask suitable questions, he created a double to ask questions to which he replied. Two hundred million in the vast crowd gained Stream-winning on that occasion. Then the Buddha reflected on what previous Buddhas had done after performing the Twin Miracle, and seeing that they had all ascended to Tāvatimsa to teach the Abhidhamma, he did the same.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ Since Pindolabhāradvāja was

Then he told him to set aside fifty for food and drink, twenty-four for a pair of bullocks, another twenty-four for seed, one for a spade, a machete, an axe, etc. Counting like this it became clear that a hundred would not be sufficient. Then the Buddha told the monk that a hundred gold coins was very little, and that he couldn’t hope to satisfy his desires. In the 
past Universal monarchs with fabulous wealth had been unable to satisfy their desires and died with their wishes unfulfilled. Then, on being asked to relate the story of the past, the Buddha told the Mandhātu Jātaka (Jā 258).

elder lying dead. They were awestruck that he had tamed the ferocious Nāga, who had brought lavish offerings for the elder. Then the Buddha arrived, and the Elder Moggallāna rose from his seat to worship him. The hermits were even more impressed that Moggallāna was just a disciple of the Buddha. The Buddha asked Aggidatta what he taught, and on being told, said that this was not the right way to gain liberation from suffering. The Buddha spoke on the efficacy of the Three Refuges for 
deliverance from suffering, and uttered the above verses. All of the hermits gained Arahantship together with the psychic powers, and spontaneously gained the monks’ requisites. When Aggidatta’s supporters arrived they wondered if the Buddha had become his disciple. The Buddha asked Aggidatta to destroy the doubts in the minds of his lay disciples. Aggidatta was only too pleased to do this by displaying his psychic powers and paying homage to the Buddha. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"

Sāvatthī and set out for Benares, travelling by stages with a large following of monks. On arrive at a shrine near the village of Toddeyya he stopped to rest a while. The Buddha told the Venerable Ānanda to summon a brahmin who was farming nearby. The Brahmin came and worshipped at the shrine. The Buddha praised him. To allay the doubts of the monks he told the story of Buddha Kassapa from the Ghatīkara Sutta (Majjhimanikāya, Sutta 81). In conclusion, he told the brahmin that four 
individuals were worthy of a <I>stūpa</I> (as in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta: a world-ruling monarch, an Arahant, a Solitary Buddha, and a Fully Enlightened Buddha), adding that there are three kinds of <I>cetiya:</I> one containing bodily remains <I>(sarīracetiya),</I> one indicating by signs¹ <I>(uddissacetiya),</I> and one containing requisites used by a worthy one <I>(paribhogacetiya).</I> The Buddha created a golden <I>cetiya</I> in the sky, which remained for seven days, and then became a stone <I>cetiya</I> on the ground.</FONT>

The Ānanda Bodhi tree, which was a sapling from the original Bodhi tree, was brought to Sāvatthī by the Elder Ānanda on the instructions of the Buddha, for the benefit of disciples who wanted some way to honour the Buddha in his absence. This is an example of an 
uddissacetiya, as is any Bodhi tree or even a leaf. The original Bodhi tree is a paribhogacetiya, as it was used by the Buddha himself.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=720 NOF=LY><TR VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><TD WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=30><IMG SRC="../../../../clearpixel.gif" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=1 BORDER=0 ALT=""></TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=700><HR ID="HRRule4" WIDTH=700 SIZE=3 NOSHADE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0
