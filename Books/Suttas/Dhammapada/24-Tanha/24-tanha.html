The elder brother, named Sāgata, took upon himself the burden of meditation, while the younger brother, named 
Kapila, thought he could meditate when he was older, so took upon himself the burden of study. The Elder Sāgata lived with his preceptor for five years, then having taken a meditation subject, lived in the forest and gained Arahantship. The Elder Kapila gained a large following and many material gains due to his learning, and, becoming proud, began to disparage others. The well-behaved monks reported his behaviour to his brother, who admonished him three times, but Kapila wouldn’t listen 
and became wicked. One day, taking a fan, he began reciting the Pātimokkha in the usual way 
 asking if any of the monks had any offence to confess. Thinking, “What is the use of answering this fellow, the monks said nothing.” Observing their silence, Kapila said, “What difference does it make if I recite the Pātimokkha or not?” So saying, he arose from his seat.¹ Thus did he retard the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa. After his death he was reborn in Avīci hell where he stayed until the time of the Buddha Gotama when he was reborn in the River Aciravatī as a golden fish. His mother and sister, having abused well behaved monks, were also reborn in Avīci hell.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Also during the time of the Buddha Kassapa, five hundred bandits fled into the forest to escape their pursuers. Seeing a forest monk they begged him for protection. The elder administered the five precepts to them, and admonished them to guard the precepts even at the cost of their own lives. They agreed. When the householders caught them, they executed the bandits, who were reborn as devas. 
During the time of the Buddha Gotama they were reborn at the same time in a fishing village by the Aciravatī river, and grew up together.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One day the fish was caught by the fishermen, and due to his remarkable golden colour the fishermen put it in a boat and took it to the king. The king thought, “The Buddha will know the reason for this, and had the fish taken to the teacher.” As soon 
as the fish opened its mouth, the bad smell of his breath pervaded the monastery. The Buddha questioned the fish and made him answer. “Are you Kapila?” “Yes venerable sir.” “Where have you come from?” “From Avīci hell, venerable sir.” “Where has your elder brother Sāgata gone?” “He attained parinibbāna, Venerable sir.” “Where are you mother and sister?” “In the great hell, venerable sir.” “Where are you going now?” “To Avīci hell, venerable sir.” 
Then the fish knocked its head against the side of the boat and died. Most in the audience became alarmed and horrified. The Buddha then taught the Kapila Sutta for the benefit of the audience. The five hundred fishermen, being stirred with religious emotion, requested the going forth from the Teacher.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">¹ Before entering the Uposatha hall for the recitation of the Pātimokkha, the monks 
confess any offences that they might have to one another in groups of two or three. Thus when the reciter asks, “If any monk has any offence, let him confess it” they always remain silent. The Elder Kapila was apparently blissfully unaware of this tradition as he had never bothered to train himself properly in the Vinaya discipline, thus when he asked the question he thought that the monks would confess their offences to him. Since they remained silent, he assumed that they were 
shameless, though they were just diffident to say anything to Kapila who had proved himself impossible to admonish.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="338"></A>C<A NAME="339"></A>ra<A NAME="340"></A>v<A NAME="341"></A>i<A NAME="342"></A>n<A NAME="343"></A>g is the Root of Suffering</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Just as a tree with roots unharmed and firm, though hewn down, sprouts again,

However, because he was too lazy to do any work, he was thrown out of the house, and fell into the company of thieves. One day he was caught and with his hands bound was being led off for 
execution, and being lashed with whips at every cross-roads. While walking for alms, the Elder Mahākassapa recognised him, and urged him to meditate as he had done before. When the executioners were making ready to kill him, they marvelled that he was completely unafraid. The king was informed, who ordered his release and went to see the Teacher. The Buddha manifested an image of himself before the man, and uttered the above verse, on hearing which the man attained Stream-winning. He then

Nevertheless, wise men of former times, having broken these bonds, went forth into the Himalayas. Then he related a story of the past when Brahmadatta was the king of Benares. Then a young man whose father had died, worked for hire to support his mother. Contrary to his wishes, she brought him a wife, and passed away after some time. He then told his wife 
to support herself by working for hire as he wished to go forth as a monk. She told him that she was pregnant, and asked him to wait until the baby had been born. When the baby was born she asked him to wait until it was weaned from the breast. Meanwhile she became pregnant again. Thinking that he would never escape if he did as his wife wished, he decided to leave secretly. He went to the Himalayas and became a recluse, developing the jhānas and the superhuman faculties, rejoicing in having 
escaped from the bondage of household life.

She avoided the Teacher’s presence as she feared that he would speak in dispraise of beauty. Knowing of her vanity, the king had songs composed praising the beauty of the Bamboo Grove. Hearing these songs, Khemā developed a longing to go and see for herself the beauty of the Bamboo Grove (Veluvana), and decided to go there. Knowing that she had 
come, the Buddha created a phantom of a beautiful young woman, who sat fanning him. Khemā was fascinated by the young woman, who seem far more beautiful than herself, and decided that the Teacher’s dislike of physical beauty had been misrepresented. As Khemā sat enthralled by the young woman, the Buddha made the phantom age rapidly as he was teaching the Dhamma. After a while, the phantom became middle-aged, then old, then she collapsed and died, and became a heap of bones. As Khemā 
watched this happen, she gained insight. Knowing this, the Buddha said:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp; “Khemā, look at this diseased heap of filth, oozing and trickling, longed for by fools.”</FONT></B></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On hearing this verse, Khemā attained Stream-winning.

The people piled up stacks of beds in order to watch. A young man named Uggasena, who was the son of a millionaire, fell in love with a certain female acrobat. He told his parents he would die 
unless he could marry her, and refused to eat in spite of being urged repeatedly to take a wife more suited to his family’s wealth. Unable to dissuade their son, they sent a messenger to seek the girl’s hand in marriage. Her father refused, saying that if their son wanted to marry her, he would have to join their troupe and travel with them. Uggasena joined the troupe to marry the acrobat’s daughter, and wandered from place to place, looking after the carts, and so forth. In due course, 
his wife became pregnant and gave birth. As she played with her son, she called him “Son of a cart-driver,” “Son of a firewood gatherer,” “Son of a water-carrier,” “Son of a know-nothing.” Hearing her talk like this, Uggasena decided to learn the art of tumbling. He went to her father and asked him to teach him. After a year, he mastered the art, and prepared to display his skill to the crowd for the first time at Rājagaha. An announcement was made to the crowd that Uggasena, 
the son of the millionaire, would perform, and he climbed to the top of a bamboo pole sixty cubits high. Poised on top of the pole, he called for the crowd’s attention, ready to perform somersaults. At that very moment, the Buddha entered the city for alms, and everyone paid attention to him. Uggasena performed seven somersaults, landing safely back on top of the pole each time, but there was no applause as no one was watching. Utterly deflated, he just stood there thinking that his 
performance had been a complete failure. Knowing his thoughts, the Buddha sent the Elder Moggallāna to ask Uggasena to perform his feat again. Thinking, “The Teacher wishes to see my performance,” Uggasena turned fourteen somersaults, and stood on top of the pole. The Buddha spoke to him, “Uggasena, a wise man should give up attachment to the past, future, and present to gain release from birth, old age, disease, and death.” Then the Buddha uttered the above verse, and on its 
conclusion, Uggasena gained Arahantship together with analytical knowledge (paṭisambhidā ñāṇa), even while stood on top of the bamboo pole. Uggasena descended from the pole, approached the Buddha, paid homage, and requested the Going Forth. The Buddha ordained him with the words, “Come, monk.” </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Later, the monks asked him, “Were you not afraid as you descended from the pole?” 
Uggasena replied that he had no fear, and the Buddha confirmed it, uttering this verse (Dhp v 397):</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“He who has cut off all fetters, who trembles not, <BR>who has gone beyond ties, who is unbound — him I call a brāhmana.”</FONT></B></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On another occasion the monks were talking 
about Uggasena, wondering how the son of a millionaire could become a wandering circus performer, and how could such a person be endowed with the perfections for Arahantship. Having inquired about the subject of their conversation, the Buddha related a story of the past.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the golden cetiya of the Buddha Kassapa was being constructed, a husband and wife, having taken abundant food, set 
out to work as labourers. On the way they saw an elder walking for alms. The wife urged her husband to fetch his almsbowl, and they offered him alms, both making an earnest wish to attain the knowledge that he had gained. The elder, being an Arahant endowed with psychic powers, looked into their futures and smiled. Seeing him smile, the wife said that he must have been an actor, and her husband agreed. Thus due to these words, the pair became actors, but due to their earnest wish they also

house. As soon as the young woman in the house saw the monk, she fell in love with him. She asked him to come again whenever he needed water. Later, she offered him rice gruel, and later provided him with a seat and offered boiled rice. Seating herself near him, she started talking about how lonely she was, as no visitors came to that house. Thinking about her, the young monk became discontented, and was taken to his preceptor and to the Buddha. He admitted the cause of his discontent. The 
Buddha then related an incident from the young monk’s previous life to show how he had been betrayed by her before. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At that time he had been known as Young Archer the Wise. Having acquired the skills of archery and sword-fighting in Takkasila, his teacher was so pleased with his ability that he gave his own daughter to him in marriage. On the return journey to Benares they were waylaid by 
bandits, but Young Archer killed fifty of them with arrows. Having run out of arrows, he asked his wife for his sword, but when she saw the bandit chief she fell in love with him at once, and put the sword in the bandit’s hand. The bandit slew Young Archer, took the woman with him and went his way. Realising that such a woman would kill him too, just as she had killed her husband, he abandoned her by a river, taking her jewels and crossing over to continue his journey alone. In order to 
teach the woman a lesson, Sakka appeared before her in the form of a jackal with some meat in his mouth. As a fish leaped out of the water, the jackal dropped the meat to catch the fish, but missed, and a bird flew away with the meat. When the woman laughed at this, the Jackal (Sakka) admonished her that she was even more foolish, as she had lost both her husband and her lover, but could not see her own fault. She understood and vowed to be faithful in future. Sakka scolded her again, saying 
that one who stole a clay pot would also steal a copper one, and that she would do evil again. When the Teacher had finished relating this Cūḷadhanuggaha Jātaka (Jā. 374) he told the monk that at that time he had been Sakka, the young monk had been Young Archer the Wise, and the young woman had been his unfaithful wife who had deprived him of life. On the conclusion of the above verse, the young monk attained Stream-winning.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"

Sakka went to the Jeta grove with a large retinue of deities and put the questions to the Buddha, who replied with the above verse. Sakka then requested that, since the gift of Dhamma was the best of gifts, that the merit of teaching the Dhamma should be shared with the deities whenever the monks taught. The Buddha

King Pasenadi ordered all of his wealth to be removed to the 
royal treasury. There was so much wealth, that this process took seven days. Then the king went to see the Buddha. He related what had happened and remarked that although the Buddha dwelt close by, the treasurer had not given any alms. The Buddha related the previous life of the millionaire. At one time he was a millionaire. When a Solitary Buddha named Tagarasikhim came to his house for alms, he told his wife to give him something, and got up and left. His wife, seizing this rare 
opportunity, took his almsbowl and filled it with delicious food. On coming back, the man asked the Tagarasikhim if he had been given anything, so he lifted the lid of his bowl. Seeing and smelling the delicious food given by his wife, the householder thought that it would have been better to give that food to his servants, as they would work hard, but this monk would just go and have a good sleep after eating. In that life, the householder had a nephew who would frequently point out his 
father’s property when walking with his uncle. Not wishing for his nephew to inherit his brother’s property, he took the boy and murdered him in a wood. Having suffered in hell for many hundreds of thousands of years for this evil deed, he was reborn in Sāvatthī as a multi-millionaire due to the fruition of his offering of choice alms to Tagarasikhiṃ. However, because he regretted giving it, he was unable to enjoy any benefit of this wealth, and lived on only sour rice gruel. Due to 
killing his nephew in his previous existence, he remained childless, and his property was confiscated by the king. After death, he was again reborn in the Roruva hell. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="356"></A>B<A NAME="357"></A>le<A NAME="358"></A>m<A NAME="359"></A>ishes of Mankind</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Weeds are the bane of fields, lust is the bane of mankind.
