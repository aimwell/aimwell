and racial prejudice. The Sākyans and the Kosalans were neighbours on opposite banks of the Rohinī river.&nbsp; Sāvatthī was the capital of the Kosalans to the west of the Rohinī, and Kapilavatthu was that of the Sākyans to the east. South of the Sākyan kingom lay that of the Mallas who had their capital at Kusināra. Far to the north-west lay the university city of Takkasila, in present-day Pakistan.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Prince Pasenadi, the son of the King of Kosala, lived at Sāvatthī, Prince Mahālī of the Licchavī clan lived at Vesālī, 
 and Prince Bandhula, the son of the Malla king, lived at Kusināra. These three princes studied under a famous teacher at Takkasila, and became friends. After mastering the royal arts they returned to their respective kingdoms. Prince Pasenadi was anointed king, Prince Mahālī went blind, and  was appointed as a teacher to the Licchavīs, and Prince Bandhula became King Pasenadi’s general after his parents disuaded him from killing the other Malla princes to become king. He established a residence in Sāvatthī, brought his parents, and later married Mallikā, the daughter of the Malla king.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One day, King Pasenadi saw many monks passing through the street, and was told that they were going for alms at the houses of Anāthapindika, his son, Visākhā, and Suppavāsā. The king decided that he too should offer alms to the Sangha and so invited the Buddha and the Sangha. He served them with his own hand for seven days in succession, then on the seventh day asked the Buddha always to come 
with five hundred monks. The Buddha declined, but agreed to send another monk in his stead, giving the duty to Venerable Ānanda. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The king served the monks personally for seven more days, but then neglected to do so for three days. By the third day only Venerable Ānanda remained and the king was angry that the food prepared had been left untouched, so he went to complain to the Buddha. The 
Buddha explained the nine reasons why monks are not obliged to visit householders, or if they do visit, are not obliged to sit down: they do not rise to greet them, they do not pay homage, they do not offer a suitable seat, they conceal what they possess, they give little though they have much, they give inferior quality food, they do not offer the food respectfully, they do not sit to listen to the Dhamma, they do not speak in a pleasing manner.&nbsp; For the opposite nine reasons it is 
proper for monks to visit householders and to sit down.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Wishing to win back the confidence of the monks, the king thought it would help to introduce a Sākyan princess into his household, so he sent a message to the Sākyans. They discussed what to do. King Pasenadi of Kosala was their enemy and could destroy them if they refused, but they did not regard him as of equal birth to themselves, 
so no one was willing to give their daughter in marriage. Then Mahānāma said he had a beautiful daughter by a slave-woman. So they told Pasenadi that she was the daughter of Mahānāma the Sākyan, who was the son of the younger brother of the Blessed One’s father. King Pasenadi accepted her as his chief consort, and in due course Prince Vitatūbha was born. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When he came of age he went 
to visit his maternal grandfather. The Sākyans sent all the younger princes away so that no one had to pay homage to him, but otherwise they showed him all hospitality. After he left, the seat he used was ritually washed. One or his men, who returned to collect a sword he had left behind, saw this and heard the servant cursing Vitatūbha as the son of a slave woman. When he heard this Prince Vitatūbha vowed to wreak vengeance on the Sākyans, and to wash his seat with the blood of their 
throats. When King Pasenadi heard the news he removed all royal gifts from Vitatūbha and his mother, reducing them to slaves, but reinstated them after after being advised by the Buddha. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meanwhile at Kusināra, Mallikā, the daughter of the Malla King, and wife of King Pasenadi’s general, Bandhula, became pregnant and longed to bathe in the lotus tank of the Licchavīs. Bandhula took her 
there, drove away the guards, tore down the iron railings, and allowed her to bathe, afterwards bathing there himself. The Licchavīs were enraged. Their teacher, Mahālī, advised them not to pursue Bandhula, but could not disuade them. Five hundred Licchavīs pursued Bandhula, but he killed them all. Bandhula brought Mallikā to Sāvatthī, where Mallikā gave birth to twins. As time went by Mallikā bore sixteen sets of twins, and Bandhula won public acclaim by overturning unjust decisions 
and removing the corrupt judges. The former judges told King Pasenadi that Bandhula was planning an insurrection. The simple-minded king believed them and had Bandhula and his thirty-two sons slaughtered, appointing Bandhula’s nephew, Dīghakārāyana, 
 as his general. Mallikā was offering alms to five hundred monks with the two chief disciples when she was given a letter bearing the news that her husband and sons had been decapitated. She remained equanimous, advising her daughters-in-law not to grieve or hate the king, as their husbands had to endure the results of their previous kamma. Venerable Sāriputta gave the teaching of the Salla Sutta, (Suttanipāta v 579ff), “Life is uncertain, death is certain, but unpredictable.”</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When King Pasenadi heard about this, he was overcome with remorse at his evil deed, and begged Mallikā for forgiveness. She gave it, and asked to be sent back to her family home with her daughters-in-law. The new general, Dīghakārāyana, bode his time for a while, but when the opportunity arose he took the king’s sword and turban while he was talking to the Buddha and left him. He returned 
quickly to the palace, appointing Prince Vitatūbha as king. King Pasenadi rode to Rājagaha to enlist the help of his nephew, King Ajātasattu, but died from exhaustion outside the walls of the city.<SUP>1</SUP></FONT><SUP></SUP></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Now that Vitatūbha was king, he lost no time in wreaking vengeance on the Sākyans, and slaughtered them all except his grandfather, Mahānāma and his relatives, whom

Now that she had been cleared, she decided to leave anyway. Then Migāra apologised and permitted her to invite the Buddha and the Sangha for 
alms. In spite of the protests of the Naked Ascetics, Migāra listened to the Dhamma and became a Stream-winner. From that day he regarded Visākhā as his mother, thus she became known as “Migāra’s Mother.” He had an expensive gift made for her, and thenceforth she could invite the monks whenever she wished. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Visākhā had ten sons and ten daughters, and numerous grand-children, and 
great-grand-children.

The monks wondered if she had lost her mind, but when this was reported to the Buddha he 
remarked that Visākhā was overjoyed because she had at last fulfilled a long cherished aspiration. </FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="54"></A>Morality Blows Against the Wind</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The perfume of flowers blows not against the wind, <BR>nor does the fragrance of sandalwood, tagara and jasmine, <BR>

</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Two friends lived at Sāvatthī. Sirigutta was the Buddha’s disciple, while Garahadinna was a disciple of the naked ascetics. The naked ascetics urged Garahadinna to tell his friend to offer alms to them instead of to the Buddha. Garahadinna kept asking his friend why he bothered to offer alms to the Buddha, instead of to his own teachers. Sirigutta kept his peace for a while, but eventually 
lost his patience, asking, “What do your teachers know?” Garahadinna said that his teachers knew everything in the past, present, and future; that they knew everyone’s thoughts, words, and actions. So Sirigutta said to his friend, “Why did you not tell me before about your teachers’ great powers? Please invite them for alms in my name.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">While Garahadinna went to invite the naked 
ascetics, Sirigutta had a pit dug by his house, had it filled with filth, with a rope fixed to support one side of the seats while the other side rested on the ground. As soon as the ascetics sat down they would fall into the pit. In his house, he had empty pots prepared so that they looked like they were full of food. When the naked ascetics arrived for the meal, he paid homage to them and thought to himself, “If you know the future do not enter my house as there is no food prepared, and I 
will have you all flung into a pit of filth and beaten with sticks. He invited them all to sit down at once, and they all fell into the pit. As they climbed out, he had them beaten with sticks, ridiculing them, “Why don’t you know all about the past, present, and future!”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The naked ascetics complained to Garahadinna that he had ruined them, and Garahadinna complained to the king, who 
had Sirigutta summoned to impose a heavy fine. Then Sirigutta explained what he had done and the king (Pasenadi) had a fine inflicted on Garahadinna instead. Now Garahadinna was more angry than ever, and didn’t speak to Sirigutta for a fortnight. Then he thought, “This doesn’t achieve anything” and made up with his friend. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After some time Sirigutta said to Garahadinna, “What is 
the use of offering alms to your teachers. Why don’t you invite the Buddha and his disciples for alms?” This was just the opportunity Garahadinna was waiting for. He asked, “What does your teacher know?” Sirigutta replied, “He knows all about the past, present, and future, and all the thoughts of others.” So Garahadinna asked Sirigutta to invite him. Meanwhile he prepared a hidden pit of burning charcoal. When the Buddha arrived, Garahadinna asked him to enter alone first. As he 
placed his foot over the charcoal pit he used his psychic powers to create great lotus flowers, and the monks sat down on the seats prepared by his powers. The empty vessels that Garahadinna had prepared became full of food. Garahadinna gained faith in the Buddha, and many followers of the heretics were also converted to the Buddhist faith.</FONT></P><OL></OL></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=720 NOF=LY><TR VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><TD WIDTH=20
