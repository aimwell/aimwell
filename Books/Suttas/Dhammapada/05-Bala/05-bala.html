I stand on one leg because if I used two the earth would shake.” The people believed what he said, for they had never known him to take any food. As his reputation grew, people came bringing all manner of food, wishing to make merit, but he always refused it as regular food was repulsive to him. When they pressed him 
repeatedly to accept at least a little for their sake, he took a tiny morsel of ghee and molasses on the tip of a blade of Kusa grass, and placed it on his tongue, saying, “That is enough for your welfare and happiness.” </FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After he had lived like this for fifty-five years, his evil kamma from the past finally became exhausted. One morning, when the Buddha surveyed the world in his 
meditation, he realised that it was time to visit Jambuka. He told Venerable </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Ā</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">nanda of his intention, and set off late in the afternoon. Knowing the Buddha’s intentions, the deities washed the place with a sudden storm, so that the flat rock where Jambuka stayed was spotless. The Buddha asked Jambuka if there was anywhere he could stay for the night, but Jambuka said that there 
wasn’t. The Buddha pointed to a cave nearby, and Jambuka told him to suit himself. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">During the night, powerful deities including the Four Great Kings, Sakka, and Mahābrahma came to pay respects to the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest. Jambuka wondered who it might be. In the morning, Jambuka asked the Buddha and the Buddha told him. Jambuka replied, “For fifty-five years I have 
lived by eating the wind, and have stood on one leg, but no one came to pay respects to me. The Buddha told Jambuka, “You may have deceived the foolish majority, but you cannot deceive me. Is it not true that you have lived on excrement all these years, going naked, sleeping on the ground, and pulling out your hair?” Then the Buddha told Jambuka about the evil deeds he had done in the time of Buddha Kassapa. He regained a sense of shame, so the Buddha gave him a bathing robe to put on, 
and taught him the Dhamma. Due to his long practice of meditation in his previous life, Jambuka attained Arahantship. He requested the going forth, spontaneously gaining a set of robes and an almsbowl as the Buddha said, “Come monk.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It was the day that the people of Anga and Māgadha came to offer alms to Jambuka, so a great crowd gathered. Seeing the Buddha there, they wondered who was 
the greater of the two, and concluded that since the Buddha had come to see Jambuka, that Jambuka must be the greater monk. The Buddha told Jambuka to dispel their doubts, so he rose into the air to the height of a palm tree, and paid homage to the Buddha, saying, “This is my teacher, I am his disciple.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha spoke the above verse, and many people gained comprehension of the Dhamma. </FONT>

Though they were weary from the journey, Citta asked Venerable Sāriputta to teach the Dhamma in brief, and gained the path of Non-returning. He invited the elders and the visiting monks for alms the following day. Then he invited Sudhamma. Being jealous of the honour paid to the chief disciples, and slighted by not being invited first, Sudhamma refused, saying he would walk for alms. The next day he went to Citta’s house to see what food was being prepared and refused to sit down, though invited. Citta rebuked him, and Sudhamma reported the matter to the Buddha, who told Sudhamma that he was inferior in faith and serenity to Citta, and ordered him to ask for forgiveness. Sudhamma went and asked Citta to forgive him, but he refused, so Sudhamma had to return to the Buddha. The Buddha told him that a monk should not think, “This monastery is mine, this room is mine, this is my devotee,” then spoke the above verses. Then he sent him back with a companion monk to ask forgiveness again, thinking that the journey of thirty days would humble his pride. This time Citta forgave him, and asked forgiveness in return.</FONT>
