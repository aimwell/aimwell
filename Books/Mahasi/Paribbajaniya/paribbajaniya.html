 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It seems appropriate first of all to make a brief mention of the events leading to the exposition of this discourse by the Blessed One, thereafter throwing light on the essence of this discourse. This, it is hoped, will bring greater appreciation of the precious Dhamma expounded by the Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw of Burma, an illustrious disciple of the Buddha whose intellectual and spiritual 
achievements in the field of Buddhism stand prominent in the world today.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">During the period between the fourth and fifth rains-retreats, on the full-moon day of the month of June, after his achievement of enlightenment, the Buddha went into retreat and seated himself under the pleasant foliage of a majestic tree in the great forest in the neighbourhood of Kapilavatthu. At that time, five 
hundred monks who were formerly princes of the Sakyan clan and who had by then achieved the stage of stream-winning, being intent on gaining higher insight, sought for and received the sublime teaching of the Blessed One. Having done so, they each retreated to suitable secluded spots such as the cool shade of ancient trees, ravines and valleys in the forest to continue meditation practice. After strenuous meditation they attained Arahantship in the evening of the very same day.</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Having attained Arahantship, the first monk who became an Arahant made his way to the Buddha to pay obeisance and report his accomplishment of the final goal. After taking his seat in an appropriate place before the Buddha, he looked back to see if there was any other person present. On seeing a monk coming he dismissed his original intention of reporting his spiritual attainment. He therefore remained 
in his sitting posture and immersed himself in deep silence. Then another monk followed suit, then another and another. In this manner, there was a continuous stream of all five hundred newly-fledged Arahants paying homage to the Buddha and taking a seat. When all of these Arahants had thus assembled at the feet of the Exalted One, devas and brahmās from the ten-thousand world systems appeared successively to pay respectful homage to the Blessed One and the five hundred Arahants. It is 
stated that there were only a few who failed to make their appearance on this auspicious occasion. The huge congregation of a multitude of devas and brahmās is known as the great occasion (Mahāsamaya). At this congregation, the Buddha solemnly proclaimed the number of devas who were present and the respective celestial abodes from where they came to join the assembly. The words uttered by the Buddha were given the name of the Mahāsamaya Sutta and were recited as such at the First Buddhist 
Council.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The impact of the Buddha’s announcement on the devas and brahmās brought about a fitting composure in them. They were in a state of bliss, mentally strong, firm and receptive. The Buddha then delivered a series of discourses, six in number, the essence of each discourse being intended to suit the natural tendency and disposition of the respective devas or brahmās. Of these six 
discourses, the first is the Sammāparibbājanīya Sutta — the Discourse on the Correct Homeless Life — which is specifically meant for those devas and brahmās who have the natural tendency to indulge in sensual pleasures or, in other words, who are dominated by the habit of lust or sensual desire. The subject matter of this discourse is presented here for the benefit of all.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In this 
discourse, all the questions were put to the Blessed One by the Nimmita Buddha, a created image of the Buddha. The discourse begins with the Nimmita Buddha eulogising the noble qualities and supreme attributes of the Lord Buddha in the following way, “All sentient beings in this universe are not only drifting along with the tide of sensual desires but are also drowned in them. It is because of their attachment to sensual existence that they are thus adrift and submerged in the raging flood 
of existence. This is the result of wrong view, only those who have confidence in the teaching of the Buddha in this dispensation will have the chance of being liberated from this whirlpool. Wrong believers are simply drifting and sinking. Not knowing the truth of the law of impermanence etc., they are carried away by the rush of turbulent waters of darkest ignorance. The Buddha, however, has escaped from the four whirlpools and reached the other shore, the safe haven of nibbāna. With the 
attainment of Arahantship, all clinging and desires become extinct, which is known as <I>sa-upadisesanibbāna.</I> This means peace and serenity unperturbed by the sensual pleasures of existence, i.e. annihilation of all defilements while the body and mind still remain. For this reason, the mind of the Blessed One is absolutely calm, tranquil and unruffled without the slightest taint of defilements.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Following this eulogy, the Nimmita Buddha posed a question, “How should a bhikkhu, who leads a holy life of solitude in the forest after renouncing household life and discarding all worldly pleasures, conduct himself well so as to escape from this mundane world and from all fetters?”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Thereafter, the questions and answers cover 
a wide range of human thought, explaining right and wrong from the Buddhist point of view. Beginning with the good advice to dispel erroneous views such as beliefs in omens, bad dreams, weird sounds and various other kinds of superstitions such as fatalism, supernatural occurrences portending good or evil, prophesy and propitiation of spirits, and blind belief in astrology, it comprehends the method of extinguishing human passions, evil desires, greed, attachment and lust. Furthermore, the 
method of following the right path has been elucidated; how the path and fruition knowledge can be achieved through insight meditation and how freedom from the three kinds of becoming can be gained.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This discourse gives a comprehensive treatment of the fundamental principles of Buddhism. It also prescribes the way to overcome conceit arising from egotism, animosity and sceptical doubt. 
Moreover, it shows us how to devote ourselves to the practice of insight meditation to get rid of these human imperfections and shortcomings which will only accumulate demerits. It enjoins us to practise the contemplations on loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic-joy and equanimity, and to diligently follow the Noble Eightfold Path to gain the realisation of the Four Noble Truths i.e. the cessation of suffering — nibbāna.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditation exercises to be employed are also explained in brief. The ten fetters<I> (samyojana</I>) that bind men to continued existence, and which can only be got rid of by Arahantship, are outlined. While listening to this discourse with concentrated attention, one billion devas and brahmās attained Arahantship. The number of those who achieved various stages of insight knowledge was, however, innumerable.</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It is really surprising that the Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw, the author of this discourse in its Burmese version, has been able to compress into a small volume the various aspects of the noble Dhamma, which serves as an antidote to all ills and misery.</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;</FONT></P></TD><TD

following questions in accordance with the wishes of the real Buddha.</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Pucchāmi muṇiṃ pahūtapaññaṃ,<BR>tiṇṇaṃ pāraṅgataṃ parinibbutaṃ ṭhitattaṃ.<BR>Nikkhamma gharā panujja kāme,<BR>kathaṃ bhikkhu sammā so loke paribbajeyya.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“I pose this question to the Master who is fully endowed

The Buddha had profound and immeasurable wisdom, knowing all the Dhamma. All the beings in the world have been drifting in the current of 
sensual passion and are being drowned in it. They are drifting and sinking in lust for life and also in erroneous beliefs. When the Buddha’s Dhamma is shedding its light, the believers in the Dhamma have a chance of swimming across the current of erroneous beliefs. All the other beings are drifting and sinking; they are drifting and sinking in the currents of ignorance which blind them to the truth about impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self. The Buddha has already swum across the 
four currents and arrived at the other shore — the peace of nibbāna. The state of being free from all kinds of defilements having arrived at the stage of Arahantship is called <I>sa-upādisesa nibbāna.</I> The Buddha had peace from that and thus his mind was stable. The above verse is in adoration of the Buddha, the following is the gist of the question.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Renouncing passion in all its

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha said that that bhikkhu had discarded all superstitions, or secular auspicious signs <I>(maṅgala),</I> by means of Arahantship. Superstition consists in belief in misfortune in regard to lightning strikes, mysterious fires etc., and in both good and bad luck in dreams, peculiar marks on domestic animals, and on tools and appliances.

For instance, the sights of a swallow, a lark, a bird that speaks human words, a pregnant woman, an unmarried male or female, a pot full of water, a thoroughbred horse, a large bull … such sights are considered to bring good fortune, i.e. they are auspicious signs. Such superstitions prevail in India even today, and some in Burma too. In ancient times, the sight of a beggar was taken to be a bad omen.</FONT>

She told each one of them that he was of a lower caste and drove them out. Then she 
washed her face because, she said, she had seen a bad sight. She was in the habit of denigrating people for their low caste. She drove them away, saying that seeing them was a bad omen. Due to this habit of screening people by sight, labelling them generally as a bad omen that this daughter of the rich man was named Dittha-Mangallikā — “Believer in visible omens.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At that time the 
Bodhisatta was born as a beggar, and his name was Mātanga. Beggars were not allowed to live in the city. 
 One day Mātanga went into the city on some business. Beggars were required to put on rags when they entering the city. They were also required to make a sound so that others of higher caste were warned of their approach. Mātanga put on dark clothes, carried a basket in one hand and a small bell in the other to warn of his approach. He was also required to pay respects to the passers-by. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">While 
Mātanga was walking on the road, the rich man’s daughter, Dittha-Mangalikā, came riding on a horse-cart to the bank of the river to take a bath and to picnic with her attendants. When she heard the bell, she looked and saw the man. “Who is this man?” she asked, and was told that the man was a beggar. Then she felt that it was a bad omen occurring at the time of going to the auspicious bathing ceremony and picnicking on the riverside. She turned back immediately and returned home to 
wash her face. Her attendants were angry with Mātanga for having spoilt the fun and beat him up. If you want to know the full story, please look up the Mātanga Jātaka, Story No.497 of the book of Jātakas. Dittha-Mangalikā’s story can also be found in the Citta-Sambhūta Jātaka, Story No.498.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Auspicious Sounds</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Auspicious sounds <I>(suta mangalā)</I> is superstition regarding the hearing of sounds. Sounds of joy and laughter are taken to be auspicious and sounds of weeping and mourning are bad omens. The cry of an owl, for instance is auspicious, but the cry of a night bird is a bad omen.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Auspicious Contacts or Odours</FONT></H4><P

A sweet smell or a pleasant touch is considered to be auspicious, and conversely a bad smell or an unpleasant touch is a bad omen. According to the caste system in India, physical contact, however slight, with a beggar or a low-caste person is considered to be a bad omen. Once, a low-caste student had a slight touch with his high-caste teacher by mere accident, but the teacher could not forgive him and thrashed him soundly, according to a paper I happened to read.</FONT>
</P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Choosing Auspicious Days Is Useless</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Included in such beliefs are the superstitious reckoning of auspicious and inauspicious days according to the movement of stars and other astrological calculations, when the occasion for an alms-giving ceremony or a wedding is to be determined. 
Auspicious dates are chosen for the occasion of ceremonial laying of foundation-stones of a new building, such as a house or a monastery. These are, after all, superstitious practices. It does not matter whether a certain time is auspicious or inauspicious, as long as the construction is carried out properly according to the plans. If the construction is not done properly it won’t be successful despite the fact that it had been started on an auspicious date. In the same way, a marriage 
contracted on an auspicious date may fail if the partners cannot maintain a good relationship, and they will be separated. Such cases are many, just as some pagodas and monasteries remain uncompleted.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Personally, I regard this practice of choosing auspicious dates as useless. Nowadays, most people in Rangoon don’t seem to care for auspicious days and usually choose Sundays to hold their 
ceremonies. That is quite a rational method. Sunday is an official holiday; so any ceremony held on any other day cannot attract as large an attendance as is desired.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="FalseBeliefs"></A>Dispelling False Beliefs is Important</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">According to this verse, it is important to dispel 
false beliefs regarding such secular auspicious signs or superstitions. In fact, good fortune and misfortune are related to one’s merits and demerits of the past. They are also related to one’s wholesome and unwholesome deeds of the present. The benefits of one’s merits will engender good fortune, and the effect of one’s demerits will constitute misfortune. So we should believe unreservedly in our own kamma. That would then be the right view of the ownership of one’s actions <I>(kammassakatā sammāditthi).</I> Belief in superstitions is contradictory to it and is a form of wrong view. So the main thing is to dispel such wrong view. All false beliefs can be dispelled by the path of Stream-winning. However, since a Stream-winner may be married he cannot be completely rid of all the superstitious beliefs. While still living in human society, one feels obliged to conform to practices of secular auspicious signs to a certain extent. We don’t believe in auspicious or inauspicious days, but we feel obliged to permit religious ceremonies to be held on days chosen by lay disciples as auspicious. The same is the case with foundation-laying ceremonies for new monasteries. We make such concessions because we do not wish to sow doubts in the minds of lay disciples if the construction doesn’t work out according to plan.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As a matter of fact, there is no connection whatsoever between good results and auspicious times chosen after astrological calculations. Once, during the time of the Buddha, a certain man in the city of Sāvatthī asked for the hand of the daughter of another man for his son and fixed the date of the wedding. Then only he approached his heretic teacher and asked if the date he had chosen was the 
right one. The teacher took offence for not having been consulted before the date was chosen and said that the date was not the right one. “If you hold the wedding ceremony on that day, there will be great destruction,” the cunning teacher said. So the man did not go to the bride’s house on the appointed day. He went only the following day with his son. The bride’s parents were angry at the man’s non-appearance and married their daughter to another young man. When the man arrived 
the next day with his son, they were roundly abused and driven out.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The news of this incident spread and reached the ears of the Buddha’s disciples who fell to discussing it. When the Buddha came and asked what the topic of discussion was, he was told the story. The Buddha said that such an incident was not new, for a precedent had occurred in the past. He then related the story in the 
Nakkhatta Jātaka (Jā.49). The wise man in that story said in the following verse:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Nakkhattaṃ patimānennataṃ, attho bālaṃ upacchagā. <BR>Attho atthassa nakkhattaṃ, kiṃ karissanti tārakā.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Benefits will approach and pass the fool who waits for an auspicious time according to the planets. Getting 
the benefit desired is the same as getting it at an astrologically favourable time. What can the planets do?”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This verse is noteworthy. In the present time there are instances of failure to get good results from failing to get things done in good time, or rather at a time when it is advisable to do the work. Two or three years ago, a certain woman from Mergui came to Rangoon to get 
her eye disease treated, but she was a little late because she waited for an auspicious date for departure from her home town. The doctors said that the disease could not be cured because they were consulted too late. I heard about this incident from a lay disciple. This is an incident to remember in the matter of waiting for an auspicious time.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The bhikkhu who has discarded all beliefs in 
secular auspicious signs will not be disturbed by them any longer, and will thus attain perpetual happiness. The Buddha said that such a bhikkhu had rid himself of these undesirable beliefs and notions, he can carry out good work in human society.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Furthermore, you should get rid of all the superstitions relating to lightning strikes, mysterious fires or similar disasters. Such disasters are 
seldom met with. Then superstitions about dreams must also be dispelled. The scriptures say that dreams occur to eminent people on the eve of some great events of good or bad effect. To the ordinary person, however, dreams are of no significance; they are mere reflections of their fears and fancies. Whatever they may be, all dreams are to be disregarded. When one reaches the stage of Arahantship, one would not have any dreams at all. We all should strive to reach that stage.</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Here, one may pause to reflect. This discourse was delivered to an audience of devas and brahmās, and these celestial beings never have occasion to dream, so they wouldn’t have any notions connected with dreams and wouldn’t be interested in the dreams of human beings. We may wonder how the devas and brahmās would understand about dreams, but there are quite a lot of devas, such as the guardian 
devas of trees, who are living on the earth. Their lives are so closely related to the lives of human beings that they may have occasions for dreams. The Buddha’s advice to dispel superstitious beliefs based on dreams was appropriate for such terrestrial deities.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Again, the Buddha’s advice on beliefs regarding the peculiar marks on domestic animals, tools and appliances, and other things 
in daily use, was probably meant for the devas living on the earth and having estates just like human beings. According to the masters of the Vedas, certain marks on the property or on servants are responsible for good or bad luck of the owners. All such beliefs are superstitions, and they must be completely discarded.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Such beliefs presuppose the desire for making progress in life and they 
are usually held by those who have excessive desire. There may have been some such beings among the devas and brahmās whom the Buddha was addressing. When they heard the Buddha say that the bhikkhu who had discarded all these superstitions could remain content, they would probably have greater confidence in the noble bhikkhus and would at the same time strive to discard such superstitions of their own. They would, therefore, undertake meditation practice and gain greater adoration of the 
bhikkhus and the Dhamma. Thus they would achieve pure joy and immediately attain the Noble Path and its Fruition.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Secular"></A>Bhikkhus and Secular Auspicious Signs</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">According to this sermon, all the monks in the Buddha’s dispensation who have taken the monastic vows should 
discard all the beliefs about secular auspicious signs. They should not encourage people to hold such beliefs. Yet there are some monks who give lectures to promote such beliefs; they have teach people how to make propitiations to ward off ill effects indicated by dreams or signs or other things; they give instructions to do something such as carrying certain tokens, charms or amulets, in order to gain prosperity in business or promotion in official positions. Those who want to ward off ill 
luck, to become rich, or gain promotion, approach such teachers. Such monks become powerful and prosperous. According to this verse, such practices should be discontinued, and instead, one should strive for the attainment of morality, concentration, and wisdom. If one can discard all these false beliefs, one can be free from all attachments and achieve the highest happiness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To sum up, the 
question was, “How does a bhikkhu who has gone into the forest after renouncing sensuality perform his religious duty?” The answer was, “The bhikkhu who has discarded all superstitious beliefs in secular auspicious signs would properly lead the homeless life.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">May you all be able to strive to attain insights leading to the achievement of nibbāna after discarding all superstitious

pleasures of the human world and put on the saffron robes to become a bhikkhu would not yet be free from passion. Sensual desire should be got rid of, but how? Practising meditation to gain concentration and thus making one’s mind pure could bring one to the stage of the first jhāna which would diminish sensual desire. However, sensuality would not be completely eradicated yet. If the circumstances are favourable these desires would show up again. That is why there have been instances in 
which some individuals who had attained supernormal powers fell from that stage when they revelled in the voices of women. They fell from the sky while they were flying in the air. The concentration of jhāna alone would not be a safe guarantee against sensual desire. One must also employ that concentration as a basis for cultivating insight.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Getting Rid of Passion Completely</FONT>
</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The way to get rid of sensual desire and passion completely is to observe the state of mind in jhāna. It is the same as the way in which the meditators in this audience mindfully observe the various acts of seeing, hearing, and knowing. When one attains the stage Non-returning by means of mindfulness of the psycho-physical phenomena, there will be no occasion for passion to occur, and thus all 
ramifications of sensuality and craving will be eliminated.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When one practises to attain the concentration of jhāna one must try to attain access concentration, a state of calm near to the attainment of jhāna. Using access concentration as a basis, one may successfully practise insight meditation. If one does not have an opportunity to achieve access concentration, one should make 
observations of the physical and mental activities and try to attain momentary concentration which is of the same strength as access concentration as is testified to in the various Commentaries.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When one’s momentary concentration reaches full strength one will come to know mental and physical phenomena separately; one will realise the difference between cause and effect; one will 
personally know the nature of phenomena in accordance with their three characteristics — impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self. One will thus progress in mindfulness along the stages of the path until one becomes a Non-returner. At that stage sensuality and craving are eliminated. A Non-returner has, therefore, no desire for the pleasures of this human world. Nor does he long for the pleasures of the celestial world. Thus he achieves genuine peace and serenity.</FONT></P><H4
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Misery Due to Sensuality and Passion</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Today, people are suffering from all kinds of misery as a result of their desires for things, both animate and inanimate. They want to enjoy things they have enjoyed before, and strive to get them. After getting them, they try their utmost to keep them from 
loss or destruction. They have to worry about food, clothing, and shelter besides being called upon to render social services. While thus engaged they may commit several misdeeds such as killing, stealing, lying etc.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are also instances of belligerence and war between countries. So the Buddha said in the Cūladukkhakkhandha Sutta of the Majjhimanikāya (Sutta No.14) that kings quarrel 
among themselves because of their greed, lust, and desires. So do Brahmins and rich men. So do parents and their children, brothers and sisters, and other near relatives. These quarrels may even end in fights with weapons, resulting in deaths.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who commit misdeeds due to sensual desire go to hell and suffer agony, or are reborn as hungry ghosts where they suffer hunger and thirst, or in 
the animal world where they endure various kinds of misery. In short, beings in the world undergo all kinds of suffering simply because of their desire, craving, and obsession. So sensual desire is indeed a terrible affliction.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, most people consider these desires and feelings the best thing in life. So they are constantly in search of opportunities to increase these desires and 
feelings to enjoy them all the more. They think that such enjoyment of pleasures makes for happiness. However, if you are objective, you will see that the so-called happiness is not very much compared with the amount of trouble one has to go through to gain such pleasures. Therefore the Buddha taught that the pleasures of both the human and celestial worlds should be renounced.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of the two, 
namely, earthly and celestial pleasures, nobody among us has had any personal experience of the latter. It is seldom that people commit misdeeds to get celestial pleasures; only they commit all sorts of misdeeds to get earthly pleasures. So it is advisable to try to lessen the occasions for earning misdeeds to get earthly pleasures. How should we try to reduce such misdeeds? Of course, by making a note of all the physical and mental activities and thus acquire a deep knowledge of their true 
nature. If we cannot do this and just let ourselves go, then we should not fail to make a note of the arising of the desires for pleasures, and then reject them as they occur. We should know that these pleasures will push us down to hell; they are simply terrible.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are some who are under the impression that by renouncing the secular life and entering monkhood they will gain celestial 
pleasures in the next existence, and they hope for a life of pleasure in the celestial realms. Entertaining such hopes is improper, and if any desire for celestial existence occurs you should be instantly brush it aside. If you cannot get rid of it by making a note of it, you should reject it after serious consideration. If you cannot do that, you will get human and celestial existences again and again, and thus suffer all kinds of misery inherent in these existences. Then, as you wouldn’t 
be free of misdeeds, you would go to hell and other lower realms, and suffer untold misery there. Now that you have a precious human existence, you should not fail to take this opportunity of attaining the stage of Non-returning through the intensive practice of insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If you have attained that exalted stage of Non-returning, you will be quite safe. In the present existence you 
will not suffer misery due to sensual pleasures simply because you have no craving for them. Then after you have passed away, you will attain the brahmā realms. There, you will gain mental as well as physical bliss. Even then, there is still some suffering resulting from the physical and mental activities. To be free of this the Buddha continued thus, “The wisdom of Arahantship which sees the Four Noble Truths, overcomes and surpasses the state of continuous existences.”</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Do not be complacent after having attained the stage of Non-returner. Try to attain the final stage of Arahantship which sees the Four Noble Truths. When one attains this stage one will be rid of hankering after the three planes of existence, namely sensual, form, and formless becoming. After getting rid of this desire for existence the Arahant has no more rebirth. After passing away from the present 
existence the Arahant attains anupādisesa nibbāna, the state of genuine peace. That is the state of supreme happiness. The Arahant spends the remainder of the present existence without suffering any misery resulting from defilements, and so is genuinely happy.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">So the Buddha said, “The bhikkhu who has overcome and surpassed the hankering for the three planes of existence lives properly in 
this world.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To really know the Four Noble Truths doesn’t mean knowing them from learning by heart; such knowledge would not enable one to overcome the three types of becoming. We mean that one would attain the stage of Non-returner after completely rejecting sensual desire, and then continuing the intensive practice of insight meditation, one attains a full and deep knowledge of the 
Four Noble Truths through the wisdom of Arahantship. We advise the meditators to persist in their efforts to climb the steep path towards the final stage by way of insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of course, there is no need to repeat here the process of insight meditation, but I will tell you briefly about the contemplation of the Four Noble Truths as described in the Commentaries.</FONT></P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Contemplate"></A>Contemplate the Noble Truths</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of the four truths, only two should be contemplated. They are the truth of suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering. The other two, the cessation of suffering and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, 
need not be observed. To be free and detached from all kinds of suffering is to realise nibbāna which is the truth of cessation, the most desired objective. To achieve this objective the Noble Eightfold Path must be followed, and that is also the most desired objective. Knowing the nature of these two truths, one has only to wish for the attainment of them. Having set one’s wish on them one has to observe the truth of suffering as a prelude to the attainment of nibbāna, and that is the 
path of vipassanā, the practice of insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Observing the truth of suffering involves making a mental note of all the physical and mental activities as they occur and seeing their impermanent nature. Failing to see the impermanence of these activities would lead to an obsession with permanence, happiness, and self. Such obsession is called the aggregates of grasping <I>(upādānakkhandhā).</I> Observing the impermanence of things by making a mental note of them as they occur will bring correct knowledge, and that kind of observation is the same as following the path of insight. With the development of this correct observation, the cessation of suffering will be reached in due course.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">I wish to mention what some say about insight meditation. They say that the practice of insight meditation entails trouble and discomfort. This view is wrong due to failing to understand the true nature of the path of insight. Some think that realising nibbāna means the ultimate death and is, therefore, a dangerous state. That is also ignorance which is a wrong view of the cessation of suffering. 
Regarding the physical and mental activities such as seeing, hearing, etc., as good, and the cessation of them as bad, is nothing but delusion<I> (moha).</I> The truth is that the physical and mental activities of an organism are in constant flux, and due to their instability they are suffering. One should make an effort to see this truth through insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When one realises the 
truth of suffering one will be free from any desire for these mental and physical activities. That freedom from craving is in fact the renunciation of pleasure, which leads to liberation from the cycle of becoming. Existences are the result of craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, and death, which are the various kinds of misery bound up with existence. This freedom, even if only for a moment, is achieved by insight. Making a mental note and thus gaining insight is the path of insight 
and renouncing in this way the attachment, desire, and obsession is achieving the cessation of suffering from moment to moment.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When insight is developed, one eventually realises the truth of cessation, and thus attains nibbāna. The first stage is that of the Stream-winner, the second is that of the Once-returner, and when the third stage of the Non-returner is reached, all desires for 
sensual pleasures are eliminated. Continuing on from that third stage, one goes on to the final stage of Arahantship by means of insight. Attainment of that stage means the achievement of the cessation of suffering, whence all kinds of misery are eliminated and rebirth is precluded. The knowledge of Arahantship, full insight into the Four Noble Truths, makes one an Arahant who transcends all the three worlds and thus achieves genuine peace and happiness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

same meaning.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the previous verses the Buddha taught that one must reject sensual desire and transcend the three worlds. If one has rejected sensual desire, it goes without saying that one has rejected all the defilements such as anger, delusion, conceit, wrong view, etc. In the present verse the advice is to reject gossip, anger, malice, and prejudice. Compared to the previous verse this 
one, which refers to gossip, may seem inferior, but we should note that it was intended for the devas whose intelligence was inferior.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Gossip Must Be Rejected</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Gossip is intended to create misunderstanding between those who love and respect one another. To tell someone the faults of 
one or more persons, whether the allegations are correct or not, is gossip. Or, like the Brahmin Vassakāra, to make one doubt about another’s motives and thus create misunderstanding between them is also gossip. This has been referred to in my discourse on the Sallekha Sutta. Gossip and slander must be got rid of by means of the path of the Non-returner (as referred to in the Visuddhimagga.) We must try to attain the stage of the Non-returner in order to get rid of the habit of gossip and 
slander. Since it has been said that when one has reached the stage of the Stream-winner one would not resort to any misdeed that would pull one down to hell, a Stream-winner would not tell white lies. The object of the slanderer is to alienate two people who love and respect each other, and if they are alienated, the purpose of the slanderer is achieved. That misdeed will also pull the slanderer down to hell or one of the lower realms. A Stream-winner will never commit such a misdeed.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Although one may not yet be a Non-returner, it is best to avoid telling about other people’s faults or demeaning others.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Anger, too, can be completely got rid of only when one reaches the stage of a Non-returner, but if one could reject anger as much as possible before attaining that exalted stage it would be very much better. When anger arises, one should dispel it either by making a mental note of it or by discerning it. It should be nipped in the bud or it could acquire such strength that the angry person might resort to abusive speech or even 
physical acts of aggression. One should, therefore, cut off anger before it becomes visible to others through one’s speech and actions. We should develop this practice of rejecting anger until we reach the stage of a Non-returner.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meanness Must Be Rejected</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meanness and envy should

Similarly, if 
one’s treasured possessions such as jewellery or other valuables are stolen or destroyed by a fire, flood, or storm, one may also suffer grief and despair.

The cognition of seeing, 
hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching is nothing but the contemplation of mental and physical phenomena. When one is mindful of these, one will know from one’s own observations that the unknowing material phenomena and the mental phenomena that knows are two distinct things. One will be convinced of the law of cause and effect, and also that these mental and physical phenomena are in a constant flux — that they are impermanent. Furthermore, one will understand that this instability 
breeds suffering, and that these phenomena cannot be controlled by anyone or anything. They occur and disappear all by themselves, or in other words, they are void of self. To be fully convinced of these facts through one’s own insight one must constantly make a note of these mental and physical phenomena.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Inevitably, one cannot possibly make a note of all these phenomena fully and 
completely in the beginning. So one must start the practice by making a note of the various kinds of tactile impressions. While one is concentrating on such a tactile sensation, a thought might occur; then one must promptly make a note of that. Then, perhaps, an unbearable feeling of discomfort might occur; then that too must be noted promptly. In brief, all mental and physical phenomena must be noted as they occur. If nothing occurs, then the meditator must return to the primary meditation 
object — the rising and falling of the abdomen. If one practises like this, one must be regarded as doing good mental actions.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As one goes no making a note of these phenomena, one will be convinced of their impermanent, unsatisfactory, and non-self nature, and since one is convinced of this, there will be no reason for craving to arise. Since craving has been eliminated, at least at that 
moment, then the causes for the beginning of a new existence and its undesirable consequences will also be momentarily eliminated. This is the momentary realisation of the truth of cessation. Every time that insight meditation is practised the truth of the path is being cultivated. Thus meditation develops insight into the Four Noble Truths and, eventually, the meditator will achieve the final stage of insight and attain the highest perfection of an Arahant.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

It is like a worker who does not enjoy his work; he does not wish to be unemployed, nor does he want to be working, he is simply waiting for payday to come around. The Arahants do not want to carry the burden of their bodies, doing the daily chores such as washing and cleaning, eating, drinking, and other bodily functions, which cause inconvenience, discomfort, or even pain 
if illness sets in. Although the body might be ailing, the mind of an Arahant remains unperturbed. To him, even the natural bodily functions such as inhaling and exhaling entail discomfort, and thus the burden of bearing the body is undesirable.

They can also give free rein to their fantasies and imagination. So they want to keep their bodies; they do not want their bodies to be destroyed. By contrast, the Arahants take these so-called pleasures as occasions for discomfort or distress. They know that genuine 
happiness comes about only through the bliss of nibbāna. While they are living their final life, they are not at all attached to any of the senses, so they can abide in perfect peace and contentment.

This is also derived from the meditation practice. <I>Pahānapariññ</I>ā which means knowledge that enables one to discard the wrong views of permanence, pleasure, and self, and all the defilements arising from these wrong views.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The three supreme knowledges were acquired by the Buddha during his career as a bodhisatta until his final enlightenment. The understanding continued, of 
course, after his enlightenment but it may be noted that these three deep insights had been acquired at an early stage. The Buddha wished the bhikkhus to strive for these knowledges by purification of their minds so he instructed them thus:</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Monks, you must not feel disgruntled due to the disrespectful attitude of people, nor elated by reverence shown to you. Do not labour under the 
mistaken notion, ‘They are worshipping me because I am worthy of reverence.’ You must understand, in accordance with the three supreme knowledges, that they are merely worshipping the five aggregates.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This admonition was addressed to those bhikkhus who had not yet attained Arahantship. The Arahants have no need of such an admonition. In fact, this admonition was a reminder to the 
others to strive for the highest stage of purity. It is important for ordinary monks to look towards attaining the highest goal.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who have not yet achieved purification should maintain this right attitude when people worship them. This can be done through the practice of mindfulness. If the right attitude is maintained, then there would be no cause or occasion for vanity to arise. Just 
as one waters a flowering plant tenderly without being vain about it, because the plant is not oneself, so too, the five aggregates are not one’s self, so paying respect to them is no reason to be vain about the honour that they receive.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Contemplating Food</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The other method is to 
contemplate while taking food. How should one contemplate? A monk must not eat his meals for the sake of enjoyment. Lay people eat to gain strength and vigour so that they can enjoy life. Some people take special food such as aphrodisiacs. Monks do not take food for such purposes as gaining virility and youthful vigour, nor for putting on weight, nor for improving their complexion. They take food only for maintaining their health, to allay the pangs of hunger and to enable the body to 
function normally, and thus to live the holy life and fulfil their religious duties.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Similar contemplation should be practised when making use of the monks’ robes and the monastic dwelling. They are to be used for protecting the body from the extremes of cold and heat, from attacks by mosquitoes, scorpions, snakes and so forth. If a monk contemplates in this way he will be content with the 
simplest food, robes and dwelling place; and he will not need abundant property. He uses them only because he cannot manage without them to sustain life. Therefore, he will not be vain regarding good quality things that he might sometimes receive.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Another technique for preventing vanity is to contemplate on the thirty-two component parts of one’s body. One will realise, if one contemplates 
deeply, that this body is loathsome and that sustaining it is a loathsome process. Searching clothing and shelter is also burdensome. Herein there is nothing to feel pleased about and therefore no reason for vanity. To contemplate in this manner is necessary for those who are not yet Arahants.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Arahants have already practised this kind of contemplation fully and reached the ultimate stage 
of purity. There is no need for them to do such contemplation since they have already discarded vanity. The Buddha’s admonition was directed towards those who have not yet reached the final stage. So the last phrase of the verse says that the bhikkhu who has no attachment lives properly in the world.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This eighth verse was addressed to the monks, but lay people who worship them should also 
take a lesson from it and strive to rid themselves of pride and vanity, anger, and malice. May they, too, be able to strive for the attainment of nibbāna.</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Greed"></A>The Bhikkhu Has Abandoned Greed</FONT></H3><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Lobhañca bhavañca vippahāya, virato chedanabandhanā ca bhikkhu.<BR>

That is quite obvious to my audience here, but in those days, some devas

of suffering <I>(samudaya saccā).</I> It is essential to eradicate the cause of suffering. Desire, delight, attachment, are other names used in the Dhammasaṅganī of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka. There are more than one hundred synonyms. This greed is to be eradicated by the path of Arahantship. Until this stage is reached, it should be restrained by means of morality. Greed arises in the mind, as do desire and lust, but morality must be observed to prevent its manifestation in action or speech. One who observes strict morality will obviously avoid the misdeeds of stealing, deception, bribery, and extortion.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To remove greed even further, one must eliminate greed, desire, and lust from the mind by striving to gain mental stability through meditation. For example, if one makes a constant note of the incoming and outgoing breath passing through the nostrils, desire or greed will not generally occur. Their arising will be suppressed. During the time when one has attained to jhāna, all aspects of greed 
will be totally excluded. Even after jhāna attainment it seldom occurs. That is why some of those who had attained jhāna thought that they had attained Arahantship, though they had not actually done so. In spite of their attainment of absorption, they could fall away from that attainment and give themselves over to desire if they should come across something desirable.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One must practise 
insight meditation to remove the latent hankering for delightful objects. We have already explained how to practise insight meditation. If one makes a constant note of all phenomena as they occur, there will be no opportunity for greed to invade one’s mind. If one is fully aware of the impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self characteristics of phenomena, there will no occasion for greed to arise. If the insight is fully developed one would achieve the Noble Path and reach the ultimate goal 
of nibbāna. On attaining the first stage of the path, that of a Stream-winner, one will eliminate all immoral forms of lust that can push one down to hell. On attaining the third stage, one will get rid of all desire and lust for sense pleasures, and at the final stage one will eradicate all desires and attachment to existence.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Rejection of Becoming</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Next, the verse says that the cause of new existences must be rejected. Once greed has been eradicated by means of Arahantship, the possibility for any new existence has been been precluded. The Stream-winner is incapable of doing any evil deeds such as killing, stealing, lying, etc. that can lead to rebirth in the lower realms. Such a person will have only seven more existences in the higher realms of human beings or 
celestial realms, for the causes that could lead to rebirth beyond that limit have been removed. At the third stage, that of a Non-returner, one has eliminated the cause for any further existence in the sensual worlds, and on reaching the final stage of Arahantship, the possibility of a new existence of any kind has been completely eradicated. So when an Arahant passes away, he is said to have attained <I>parinibbāna</I> (the final release from the cycle of existence).</FONT></P><H4

Cruelty includes cutting off limbs, putting in chains, and imprisonment. In those days criminals were treated cruelly. They were subjected to all kinds of spikearic treatment, including amputation. Bhikkhus 
should obviously avoid all such brutality, since they are committed to maintaining the precepts relating to killing and torture. This behaviour is rejected when one has acquired the stage of a Stream-winner; when one attains Arahantship no trace of cruelty remains. The Buddha urged his disciples to attain the final stage in order to eradicate cruelty.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Rejection of Doubts</FONT></H4><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The verse goes on to say that the bhikkhu must overcome all doubts and hesitation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Doubts arise when one cannot decide between truth and falsehood. Uncertainty may arise regarding the Buddha’s enlightenment, about the Path and its Fruition or nibbāna, or whether the practice of morality, 
concentration, and wisdom is truly effective. There might be doubts about the Buddha’s disciples, about the law of kamma, or cause and effect. The bhikkhus should not entertain such doubts. These doubts can be totally removed only on attaining the stage of a Stream-winner, but before reaching that stage one can dispel doubts by listening to or studying discourses on the teachings of the Buddha.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meditators who are engaged in intensive practice can dispel these doubts. When one comes to realise that mind and matter are distinct and separate, the doubts about mind and matter will be dispelled. For example, one realises that the bending of the arm is the effect of the intention to bend it, which is the cause. If one can realise that one will have no doubt about cause and effect. This is equivalent to dispelling doubts in 
respect to dependent origination<I> (paṭiccasamuppāda).</I> Then when one clearly perceives the constant flux of all phenomena, one will be convinced of their characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self, and there won’t be any doubt about their instability. When one reaches the stage of a Stream-winner, all doubts will be dispelled.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Be Free from Spikes</FONT>
</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Pāḷi term <I>‘salla’</I> means ‘arrow’ or ‘spike.’ In this context the latter meaning seems more appropriate. What are the spikes referred to? They are <I>rāga, dosa,</I> and <I>moha.</I> Passion <I>(rāga)</I> is the same as greed <I>(lobha);</I> so once greed has been rejected, passion goes with it. In fact, once greed is eradicated, ill-will <I>(dosa)</I> and delusion <I>(moha)</I> disappear too. Those who are afflicted with passion suffer immense misery. Just as one suffers prolonged pain when one has been pierced by a spike, one who afflicted with passion suffers enduring misery. As long as one thinks that lust is enjoyable, one will strive to fulfil one’s desire, and this quest is bound to entail endless discomfort and distress.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Similarly, one who is prone to anger does not like to be told to restrain it, and one who is overwhelmed by delusion takes falsehood to be truth; imagining mind and matter — which are impermanent —&nbsp;to be eternal, and that the body is a self or ‘myself.’ Because of this delusion, such a person commits misdeeds unwittingly and so has to suffer the consequences in hell.

That is, he must know not only the rules and regulations of the Order, but also how to practice the Dhamma, including right living, health and hygiene, etc. He 
should also know how to guide meditators in their practice, giving them exercises suited to their abilities and inclinations.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then the monk must know how to maintain his health while he is engaged in the practice of meditation.

in accordance with the natural laws of Dhamma. This is another way of stating the Four Noble Truths. So a monk should know the truth of suffering. This knowledge is called <I>pariññā pativeda,</I> or realisation by direct knowledge. He must know the truth of the cause of suffering, and give up craving, lust, and attachment. This knowledge is known as pahāna paṭiveda, or realisation by abandoning. He must also know the truth of cessation. This knowledge is called <I>sacchikiriyā pativeda,</I> or the experience of realisation. Lastly, he must know the path leading to the end of suffering. This is realisation by development — <I>bhāvanā 
pativeda.</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Realisation by direct knowledge means knowing the truth of suffering through meditation. In other words, it is knowing the truth of suffering through making a note of the incessant changes in the psycho-physical phenomena. Because people do not know that these changes constitute misery, but think that they are the reason for joy and happiness, they are enamoured by them. 
If one makes a constant note of these changes, then nothing will be found that is pleasing or delightful. On the contrary, they will be seen as something tiresome and terrible. So the true nature of mind and matter should be discerned, so that their characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self will be known empirically. Pariññā paṭiveda means knowing empirically.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When 
one thus knows the real truth about these things, one will not hanker after them; one will reject them, and that rejection is pahāna paṭiveda. Since one rejects lust, attachment to existence will not have a chance to crop up, and since attachment is absent there will be no chance of a new existence. No existence precludes birth, old age, and death. Such cessation of attachment is experienced from moment to moment as mental noting is made. It is called momentary cessation <I>(tadanga nirodha).</I> This sort of cessation need not be anticipated, since it arises naturally as one develops insight. It is important that a meditator should work to achieve such momentary cessation.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When one has developed the meditation practice one has been developing the Eightfold Noble Path. This is realisation by development. One can know how one has been developing the Path while meditating, like this. One makes an effort to note every changing phenomenon, which is right effort. Mindfulness of the psycho-physical phenomena is itself right mindfulness, since the Buddha said that the four 
foundations of mindfulness constitute right mindfulness. By repeatedly noting each phenomenon the meditator gains momentary concentration as his attention is fixed upon the object of meditation. Such momentary concentration <I>(khanika samādhi)</I> constitutes right concentration. The Visuddhimagga Mahātīkā says that without momentary concentration one cannot gains insight. Since the mind is focused on one object in meditation, one sees things as they really are, which constitutes right view. As the mind of the meditator is directed towards observing the truth, one is bent on the right aim, which is right thought. So all of these five path factors are fulfilled by the meditator. As for the remaining three factors, namely, right speech, right action, and right livelihood, these are fulfilled by the undertaking of the precepts before taking up meditation practice. While meditating, this moral observance is not broken and becomes firmer through meditation. So the eightfold path is completely fulfilled while one is practising meditation.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There is another way to develop the path of morality. If one fails to make a note of the changing psycho-physical phenomena one will be under the delusion of permanence, pleasure, and self. Thus one will be inclined to tell lies, to use abusive language, to slander, or chatter, and thus break the precept of right speech. One may even commit killing, theft, or other immoral acts. Similarly, one may 
break the precepts to earn a living. If, on the other hand, one makes a note of the changing phenomena and contemplates their true characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self one will be able to act and live in the right way. So all the factors of the Path are fulfilled through meditation, which is called realisation by development.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Such an achievement is, in effect, 
the achievement of the Noble Path when one sees the Light of Dhamma and attains the highest state of purity. That is what the verse says of ‘knowing the true Dhamma.’ After knowing the truth about suffering, about attachment, and rejecting attachment, by developing the Noble Path one comes to the realisation of the ultimate state of cessation, thus achieving the purpose of attaining peace and tranquillity. This is knowing the Four Noble Truths.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

There are two kinds of latent defilements. One is dormant in the physical and mental make-up of a being, and can arise when there is a chance. The other kind is that which is dormant in the sense-object. Defilements can arise from any of the senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, or thinking. Actually, 
lust, greed, desire, and other emotions that constitute defilements do not lie dormant in the sense-objects. It is by association with similar sense-objects experienced previously that defilements arise. When they arise, they do so in the physical and mental make-up of a being.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Latent defilements are of seven kinds: 1)&nbsp;sensual passion <I>(kāmarāga),</I> 2)&nbsp;desire for existence <I>(bhavarāga),</I> 3)&nbsp;ill-will <I>(patigha),</I> 4)&nbsp;conceit <I>(māna),</I> 5)&nbsp;wrong view <I>(ditthi),</I> 6)&nbsp;doubt <I>(vicikicchā),</I> and 7)&nbsp;ignorance <I>(avijjā).</I></FONT><I></I>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">These latent defilements can arise in the psyche of any worldling, so it is said that these are lying dormant in the ordinary person. When one has become a Stream-winner, wrong view and doubt have been removed. However, the other five remain. When one reaches the stage of a Non-returner, sensual passion and ill-will are expelled, only the other three remain. Finally, when one reaches the final

If one does not observe and know the nature of the sense that are in constant flux, defilements will arise 
from an association of similar sense objects that have been experienced previously.

They will think that the senses and the objects are permanent and will become attached to them, enjoying them.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, the ardent meditator knows the nature of 
things and does not feel attached or pleased with any sense object, and thus avoids any kind of defilement. So there is no question of defilements lying dormant in an ardent meditator. On the other hand, those who fail to practise meditation diligently think that the sense-objects are lovely and delightful, and feel attached to them.

position in deference to others, it is a vicious pride shown by insolent behaviour towards those more noble than oneself. It is competing with others like this. “We are just ordinary monks, so we can behave as we like. We need not maintain dignity as those senior monks do.” Likewise, among laymen, it is the attitude that says, “We are just ordinary folk. We can do as we wish; we do not need to maintain dignity like public officials and rich people.” This is indeed pride that may be 
called ‘base pride.’ Such pride is called <I>‘hīna māna’</I> in Pāḷi.

These young people have some 
faith in the Three Gems and thus have taken refuge in them. So far, so good. Having faith and taking refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha can save them from states of misery.

Then he will know for himself, “There is only mind and matter, there is no person or being, which is just as the Buddha said.” Thus his faith will become really firm. When he goes on to realise the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self nature his faith will become even firmer. When he gains insight into the rise and fall of the mental and material phenomena <I>(udayabbaya ñāna)</I> the force of his faith becomes very great, but he must go on acquiring insight until reaching the Noble Path.

The conditioned things that occurred in the past are the past. The bhikkhu must abandon all attachment to the actions of matter and mind that have occurred in the past. Such attachment is due to the false belief that the five aggregates are self (I, myself, or mine). The actions in the past existence are not known, so they are not dwelt upon, 
but there are some who think, “I” existed before in the past life, and now “I” have come to live in the present life. However, people generally think more about the past within this existence. People think of their childhood days and remember what they ‘themselves’ did in the way of seeing, hearing, smelling, eating, touching and thinking.

may be asked whether or not one should think of the present with attachment. The answer is that such thoughts must also be overcome. Reference to the past and the future includes an indication to the present. The Pāḷi version admits of such an inference. For instance, if we say, in Pāḷi, “We adore the Buddha, we adore the Dhamma,” we mean to say that we adore the Saṅgha too.

In the same manner, thoughts about the past and future will have no chance to occur. They will be rejected, if only for a moment, through meditation, and that is overcoming them by momentary abandonment <I>(tadanga pahāna).</I> When one has developed the insight of the Noble Path, one will progress through the three stages to the final state of Arahantship.

They all arouse consciousness of feeling.

eventually uproot all the defilements.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The listen and learn method can be illustrated thus: <I>“Nirodha</I> is the cessation of all the physical and mental elements, and such a state spells peace of the most adorable kind. The truth of the path is the way to that state, and is also most desirable.” The listener learns to appreciate this, and his or her mind is inclined toward that most adorable state by the most desirable path. Even by this method, one can only know one truth at each time.</FONT>
</P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Knowing Simultaneously the Four Noble Truths</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The moment that one has acquired the Noble Path, one knows all of the Four Noble Truths simultaneously. That is to say that when one has seen the light of nibbāna through the achievement of the truth of cessation, one knows the truth of 
suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Knowing the truth about suffering and abandoning attachment after knowing about the true nature of attachment, one achieves the attainment of abandoning <I>(pahāna pativeda).</I> As the truth of the path is in oneself, that is, one is practising meditation, one is said to have achieved the attainment of meditation <I>(bhavanā pativeda).</I> It is clear now that by means of the insight of the Noble Path, one knows all the Four Noble Truths. In other words, after one has come to know the three truths of suffering, its arising, and the path, and thus knows, abandons, and develops what is needed, one comes to realise the truth of cessation.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To reiterate, one does not know the Four Noble Truths all at once when one is learning or practising meditation.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of the four, the truth of suffering and its cause are within the three cycles <I>(vatta)</I> whereas the path and cessation are beyond it. The latter two do not need insight meditation. Only the former two need it. In the Commentaries it is said clearly that in the case of the truth of suffering and its cause there is a need for insight meditation, but in the case of the truth of the path and the truth of cessation, there is no such need. Therefore, one who wishes to attain nibbāna, and has been constantly noting phenomena as they occur and fade away, knows the truth of suffering and its cause separately. In the meantime, as his or her mind is inclined toward attainment of the path and nibbāna, he or she is knowing the truth of the path and the truth of cessation separately. </FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the insight knowledge develops and the stage of equanimity regarding formations <I>(sankhārupakkha ñāna)</I> is reached, and as it develops further, one sees the light of nibbāna when the cessation of all conditioned things occurs. The moment that one reaches this stage, one knows all of the Four Noble Truths simultaneously.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

Then all the four attachments <I>(upadhi)</I> cease in him, and he is free from all attachment. <I>Upadhi</I> means something that is inherent, or permanently attached. What are the four? They are suffering occurring in the body, in the mind, the consequences of one’s actions, and the suffering of conditioned things.</FONT>

The devas and brahmas who attended the discourse on this Sammāparibbājanīya Sutta attained the various stages of enlightenment in such staggering numbers. That is amazing!

with perfections.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Perfections <I>(pāramī)</I> is nothing other than learning and practising meditation. If those practising here now have not yet acquired perfections in this life-time, they will acquire it in their second, third, or subsequent life-time by continuing the practice.

enlightenment.
