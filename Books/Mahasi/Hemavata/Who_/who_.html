The main points of interest are the three questions that Hemavata put to the Buddha. Hemavata became a Stream-winner after hearing the Buddha’s reply to the second question, but in deference to the Dhamma, Hemavata put the third 
question as follows:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Lord, in this world, who can swim out of the eddying currents of the defilements?”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the endless cycle of existences, called samsāra, there is a swift current with eddies called 
defilements. Who can swim skilfully enough to swim out of this current? Hemavata repeated the question in another metaphor, saying, “Who can swim out of the vast stretch of deep water, called samsāra?”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Samsāra, which is an uninterrupted flow of existences, a successive arising and dissolution of

the physical and mental phenomena without fail, and who is wise, can swim across the stream of samsāra, which is very difficult to cross.” This is the Buddha’s answer to the first part of Hemavata’s question.</FONT></P></UL><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Sensuality"></A>The Current of Sensuality</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Delightful objects invite desire and attachment, called <I>kāma,</I> which is likened to a current with eddies 
— <I>kāmogha.</I> Those who are involved in desire, lust, and attachment are said to be drifting in the current of desire. Those who like and want the objects of desire, such as sights, sounds, odours, tastes, touches, men or women, or property of all sorts, have to strive to obtain and possess them. Once they obtain them, they have to try to preserve and maintain their possessions. They may resort 
to unwholesome deeds such as theft, murder, robbery, cheating, or adultery. For committing such unwholesome deeds they will go down to hell and other realms of misery. That is what is called drifting in the sea of samsāra.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Other people do wholesome deeds and are accordingly able to gain existence in human or celestial 
worlds where they are endowed with wealth, which they enjoy immensely. That is also called being immersed in the sea of samsāra. Existence in human or celestial worlds presupposes old age and death, from which one will surely feel anguish and suffer from misery. That is, in fact, immersion in the sea of samsāra.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Existence"></A>The Current of Existence</FONT></H4><P

When they reach these higher realms 
of existence their life-spans are very long, to be counted in aeons, but they are not everlasting. They have to die, and though some go to the celestial worlds, others go to the human world where misery abounds. They get only a temporary relief, not release from the cycle of existences.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="WrongViews"></A>The Current of Wrong Views</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To be entangled in the various currents of wrong views <I>(ditthogha)</I> is very common. There are many kinds of belief, some belonging to particular racial groups and some to particular localities. The various beliefs can be broadly categorised into two: one embracing the view that a being is indestructible, called eternalism <I>(sassata ditthi),</I> and the other that a being is destroyed completely after its death, 
called annihilationism <I>(uccheda ditthi).</I> Those who embrace the latter belief do not care to avoid unwholesome deeds, nor do they feel the need to do wholesome deeds. They can do whatever they like if they avoid crimes punishable by law. They believe that they will not be obliged to pay for the deeds they have done during their lifetime or later because, in their view, there is no more new existence. Such people will probably go to hell and other realms of misery, because the deeds they 
have done during their lifetime will usually be far from wholesome. This is an example of getting into trouble by following a wrong path.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some people today turn the Buddha’s teachings upside down and advise their followers not to do wholesome deeds, nor to practise meditation, or they would only get trouble. Their followers would 
most probably do only unwholesome deeds and are very likely to go to hell.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who believe in the indestructibility of beings do some deeds, which they take to be wholesome, but such deeds may include sacrifice of animals in rites. Such unwholesome deeds done under mistaken notions will surely send the evil-doers to hell. It is like taking the wrong medicine, which aggravates a 
disease. Other people believe that they can do anything with impunity if they have faith in their God.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are worshippers of the sun, the moon, the mountains, the spirits or gods. Others believe they can be delivered from misery if they starve themselves, go naked, remain in the heat of the sun, or 
stay immersed in water. Some believe that they will be free of misery if they keep their minds idle. How can anyone gain morality, concentration, and wisdom without making the mind work properly and effectively? All beliefs in religious practices that cannot lead to liberation from samsāra belong to what is belief in rites and rituals <I>(sīlabbata parāmāsa). </I>The followers of such faiths will never get out of the 
great whirlpool of samsāra. They will go through a long series of existences as they drift along in the current of samsāra. This is really terrible.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Ignorance"></A>The Current of Ignorance</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Another current is the current of ignorance <I>(avijjogha),</I> which means ignorance of the Four Noble 
Truths. People mistake suffering for happiness, they do not know the truth of suffering <I>(dukkha sacca). </I>All actions arising from psychophysical phenomena are really elements of suffering. Yet most people believe that the sights, sounds, odours, tastes, touches, and thoughts that they like are good. Such a belief results from ignorance or delusion. Liking such things is craving, to be attached to them is attachment <I>(upādāna),</I> and to strive to gain the objects of desires is kamma, either wholesome <I>(kusala

One must have great ability to swim out of them. That is 
why Hemavata asked the Buddha who could swim out of them. In answering that question, the Buddha described the qualifications of the successful swimmer.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Swimmer"></A>Qualifications of A Successful Swimmer</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha said that the first qualification of the successful swimmer is that he or she must always be 
fully equipped with pure morality. This is a really essential qualification, so the Buddha put it first. One with firm confidence in the Dhamma must believe that only if one is always keeps pure morality, can one overcome the four great currents, and thus attain nibbāna. Some doubters may refer to the story of </FONT><A HREF="http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/santati.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Santati</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">, a king’s minister, who attained nibbāna just before his death “... while the smell of liquor had not yet left his mouth,” and wonder whether perfect morality is essential. Well, such instances are very rare, I should say, one in a hundred thousand. Such individuals already had perfections of the highest order. They were rare even in the time of the Buddha. They were exceptions. The Buddha 
knew about them and their grade of perfections.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Among the first five disciples, only </FONT><A HREF="http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/annaa_kondanna.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Venerable Kondañña</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"> attained to the stream-winning on the day of 
the Dhammacakka Sutta. The other four had to strive for four more days in succession to attain it, one after another. Not all of them had perfections of the same calibre. Such differences in grades and calibre of perfections should be noted. Some individuals realise the Dhamma while listening to a discourse, but they are very rare. Others have to work for some time, some for a few hours, others for days, months or years, according to their respective perfections.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Now, in the Buddha’s words about always keeping pure morality, the word ‘always’ means from the time of beginning meditation throughout the period of practice. Only then can one be happy because one has kept one’s morality pure. That joyful feeling of non-remorse will lead to concentration. Otherwise, doubt about one’s own morality will impede the attainment of steady concentration. Without 
concentration one cannot gain insight knowledge, and without insight knowledge, the path and fruition would be far beyond one’s reach. For a layperson, one must be fully equipped with the five precepts, for a monk, one must be equipped with the Pātimokkha sīla. Morality is a prerequisite, the first qualification for one who strives to swim out of the four great currents.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The second qualification relates to concentration. It means that after becoming established in pure 
morality, one must work hard to attain the states of concentration and absorption. It means that one must work for the attainment of all the eight kinds of jhāna or at least one or two of them. This is for disciples with distinguished abilities. If one cannot strive to attain absorption, one must work for attainment of access concentration <I>(upacāra samādhi)</I> or its equivalent — momentary concentration <I>(khanika samādhi),</I> that is <I>vipassanā samādhi.</I> This is the least requirement for one to become fully 
equipped with purity of mind <I>(cittavisuddhi),</I> and with this, one can attain nibbāna. Otherwise, the purpose would not be achieved.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The third qualification is wisdom. Wisdom can be attained only by being mindful of the occurrence of one’s mental and physical phenomena. One can rightly understand the incessant flux of activities and 
phenomena only when one notes them within oneself. How could one gain right understanding by noting another person’s mental and physical activities? You may think that a person is happy, but he may really be in a sad mood. In the same manner, you may think someone is doing a wholesome deed, but he might be doing something unwholesome. One can only truly know about oneself. If one notes what is going on within oneself, one can know what is really happening. To note the things in flux 
within oneself is not too difficult. One has only to note things as they occur or disappear in rapid succession.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Eko-dhammo"></A>Do Not Talk Rashly About Eko-dhammo</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who have attained jhāna must note the jhāna and all phenomena arising from seeing, hearing, 
etc. Those who have not attained jhāna must note what they see, hear, etc. That is they must note the activities arising from mind and matter. Some say that noting activities as they occur will lead to a deterioration in concentration. They say that it contradicts the idea of single purpose <I>(eko-dhammo).</I> Such individuals do not understand the practical operation of vipassanā. Vipassanā is not 
concentration on a single object. One must note all mental and physical phenomena. If one does not note them, one will probably take them to be permanent, able to give happiness, and possessing self. Such thinking will lead to kamma, which in turn will lead to renewed existence. The purpose of vipassanā is to remove such consequences by noting phenomena, and realising the three characteristics. The Buddha said that all phenomena must be perceived with insight.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the texts and commentaries, eko-dhammo is never mentioned in the sense of single purpose.

rashly take it to be. It means that one should persevere with one method of meditation, though as many as ten different methods are mentioned in the texts. Talking rashly about eko-dhammo without knowing its proper meaning and intent should be discouraged.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">By noting whatever is happening in one’s own body and mind, and thus gaining concentration, one 
gains insight by perceiving mind and matter separately, and by realising the deep significance of cause and effect. Insight is achieved by the profound realisation of the three characteristics. When insight knowledge has been gained and developed, one will advance to the Noble Path. One who has attained the Noble Path is the swimmer who can swim out of the swift and turbulent currents of samsāra. That is what the Buddha said in reply to Hemavata’s question.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The method of swimming out of these currents will now be explained for the benefit of those who still need further clarification. If one can discern nibbāna through the insight of the path of stream-winning, one is said to have crossed the current of wrong views <I>(ditthi).</I> That is why it is said that a Stream-winner is free of the obsession about self <I>(atta),</I> and the belief in annihilationism <I>(uccheda ditthi).</I> He 
or she is also rid of the wrong view called sīlabbata parāmāsa, which holds that one can gain deliverance from samsāra, not by working to gain morality, concentration, and wisdom, but by performing rites and rituals. A Stream-winner has firmly established confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and knows that one must work to gain morality, concentration, and wisdom. Those who are not Stream-winners are indecisive in their beliefs and so go around looking for mentors. More often 
than not, they get caught in the nets of bogus teachers, and thus suffer incessantly in their long journey through samsāra.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As for Stream-winners, they never deviate from the right path. They will gain liberation from the suffering inherent in existence after seven more existences at most.

One must continue with the meditation practice to progress further. It is only when one has attained the stage of non-returning that one has completely eradicated sensual 
desire. A Non-returner has no desire at all, and will not even think of wanting anything. They have no preferences, no craving, or longing. Thus, they are blissfully happy, free from the misery that results from desire. Yet they still have to swim across the current of existence.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator who has achieved the stage of non-returning must continue meditation until attaining 
the most mature insight, <I>arahatta magga-ñāna. </I>Only then has the meditator successfully swum across all four currents, including the current of ignorance, and escaped from samsāra.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Fetters"></A>The Arahant Overcomes All Fetters</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha continued, “Hemavata, the Arahant who has overcome all the fetters <I>(samyojana),</I> after

For the Arahant there is no new existence, as he 
or she has completely escaped from the current of samsāra. A Non-returner has crossed the currents and is on the way out of the stream. A Once-returner has no more than two existences to strive for deliverance, and a Stream-winner has at most seven more existences to go through. All of them have saved themselves from hell and the realms of misery. An ordinary person has no guarantee against falling into hell, though he or she may have done many wholesome deeds. To ordinary persons the 
cycle of existences is like a stormy sea in which there is nothing to grasp, or take refuge on to keep oneself afloat.

He worked his hardest, practising meditation by walking up and down the walkway 
barefooted. Since his feet were so soft and tender, they soon blistered and started bleeding, until the walkway became stained with blood, yet he did not give up. However, he could not achieve the purpose of the Dhamma. Eventually, he despaired and thought of leaving the Sangha.

All these Noble Ones fulfilled the exhortation of the Buddha by practising meditation and achieving the purpose of the Dhamma. The two new monks who entered the Sangha 
thought that those who practised the Dhamma were many, and that as they were young they should first study the Dhamma, and practise the Dhamma only when they grew old. Thus applying themselves diligently to the study of the literature of the Dhamma, the two monks became masters of the Tipitaka. They then taught the Dhamma to five hundred monks, and became famous teachers.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Let us now consider the decision made by the monks who were later to become Hemavata and his 
friend Sātāgiri. They decided to study the Dhamma when young and practise it when old. Who can guarantee that a person will not die young? If he dies young, then he will miss the opportunity of practising the Dhamma. The Buddha’s wish is for all to start the practice of the Dhamma when young.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Dhammapada"></A>The Buddha said in the Dhammapada:</FONT></H4><UL><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“The bhikkhu in the Buddha’s dispensation, who practises the Dhamma while young with a view to attaining the path and its fruition, enlightens the world [which is synonymous with his own five aggregates] just as the moon that is unobscured by clouds, illumines the world.” (</FONT><A HREF="../../../../Books/Suttas/Dhammapada/25-Bhikkhu/25-bhikkhu.html#382"><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Dhp v 382</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">)</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The person who practises vipassanā enlightens his or her own world in the same way that the moon illumines the world. Starting the practice with the regular noting of the rising and falling of the 
abdomen, thus coming to know the real nature of mind and matter. Then, as the meditator goes on noting, he or she comes to know the real nature of the mental aggregates, realising the profound truth of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self. As practice progresses, insight matures and enlightens his or her world, or the five aggregates.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It may be asked whether the same kind of enlightenment will not occur in older meditators. Certainly it 
will, but realisation and enlightenment may be slow to come. Age slows down the mental and physical faculties. Someone of thirty may achieve his or her purpose within one month whereas someone of sixty or seventy may succeed only after two or three months. The difference lies in mental and physical health and vitality. An older person also usually has more responsibilities, and so more worries 
and anxieties. A young person’s intelligence is keen while an older person’s is deteriorating. The latter may have more distracting thoughts to contend with. So the Buddha especially praised those who practise meditation while still young.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">For monks too, it is better if newly-ordained monks start the practice of meditation while they are 
young and enthusiastic. Their confidence is strong, and their morality is free from doubts and defects. Although it is admittedly important to pursue the study of the Dhamma, young monks should do meditation practice for at least the first three months. That is my opinion. Perhaps the monks who were to become Hemavata and Sātāgiri died before they became old. They seem to have had no opportunity to practise the Dhamma.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">These two venerable monks received the high esteem of their disciples, both monks and laity, and the Buddha Kassapa’s dispensation was then flourishing. At that time, two young monks lived in a monastery, one was a strict follower of the rules and regulations of the Sangha and the other was a recalcitrant monk. When the scrupulous monk pointed out the errors of the corrupt monk, he would not 
tolerate any criticism. The former told him to wait until the time for invitation <I>(pavāranā)</I> came. All monks are obliged to attend the invitation ceremony at the end of the rainy season, when they invite one another to point out offences against the rules and regulations of the Sangha. This ceremony is held annually on the full-moon day of October at the end of the rainy season. One who is criticised for 
his offences or misbehaviour thanks those who point out his faults and undertakes to be more careful in future. This ceremony of criticism is intended to purify the Buddha’s dispensation. The Buddha Gotama also prescribed this ceremony, and attendance is compulsory.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One should be grateful to a critic who points out one’s faults, for such criticism gives one an 
opportunity to make amends. An offence in a monk is far more serious than a fault in a layman. If a monk dies without knowing that he has committed an offence, and so has had no opportunity to make amends, he can go to hell. If he knew his offence and made amends accordingly, his morality would become pure. If, after regaining purity, he practises the Dhamma, he can gain wisdom of a high order, but if he died, he would go to the celestial realms. So the Buddha said in the Dhammapada:</FONT>
</P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“The wise man who points out others’ faults with wholesome intentions is loved and respected by good people, but hated by the corrupt and evil-minded.” (</FONT><A HREF="../../../../Books/Suttas/Dhammapada/06-Pandita/06-pandita.html#77"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Dhp v 77</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">)</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The recalcitrant monk was opposed to the scrupulous monk. So the latter told the former that he would report the matter to the synod of senior monks. The recalcitrant monk was afraid that he might be punished, so he approached the members of the synod, and gave them robes and begging bowls, 
and paid them respects. He rendered small services to the senior monks and behaved meekly. The monks asked him what the matter was. He said that he had had a dispute with his companion over his behaviour, and asked them to reserve judgement when his case came up to the synod. The senior monks said that they could not overlook any case, but the recalcitrant monk insisted. The monks had already accepted his gifts and services and felt rather diffident to deal with his case. So they promised 
to overlook his case when it came up. This is, of course, partiality and corruption. Thus reassured, the recalcitrant monk went back to his monastery and treated his colleague arrogantly. The scrupulous monk had some suspicions and made discreet inquiries. He began to wonder at the delay in the disposal of the case he had put up to the synod. The disciples of the senior monks whom he approached were reticent.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The recalcitrant monk became more and more brazen-faced. He asked the scrupulous monk about the case and insolently challenged him. “Now you have lost your case. You should not come back to the monastery. Go elsewhere, do not live with me,” he said. The scrupulous monk asked the senior monks about the case and received an unsatisfactory answer. These old monks were otherwise very honest, 
but since they had accepted favours from the corrupt monk they deviated from the path of honesty.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The scrupulous young monk shouted, “Since the passing of the Kassapa Buddha you two monks, senior and learned, have been looked up to as another Buddha, but you have rendered yourselves unfit to pass judgements on cases relating to the rules and regulations of the Sangha. The Buddha’s 
dispensation has gone to decay, it is being destroyed.” Of course, such corrupt practices are to be deplored.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The two senior monks became repentant when they heard the accusation made by the young monk and this prick of their conscience persisted throughout their lives. They could not get rid of their 
doubts about their honesty even after long years of service to the Sangha by teaching their disciples the Dhamma and observing the rules up to the time of their death. So they became celestial ogres in the Himalayas though they should otherwise have reached higher regions of existence in the celestial world because of their great services. One came to be known as Hemavata and the other as Sātāgiri. 
They belonged to the higher echelon of the ogre (guardian angels) hierarchy, holding the rank of commandants of the ogre battalions. There were twenty-eight such high officials, including these two, under the charge of the chief, Duvera. Celestial ogres are far superior to the ordinary ogres though they are not handsome like devas.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Hemavata and Sātāgiri repented their misdeeds in their past lives and deplored their weakness when 
they succumbed to corruption by a wicked monk. They said that their long and meritorious services to the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha should have sent them to one of the higher regions of the celestial realms. They were remorseful when they found that some of their lay disciples had gained the upper regions, whereas they were obliged to take lower positions. They promised each other that if one of them had some good news he would immediately inform the other. In pursuance of this promise, 
Sātāgiri hurried to his friend, Hemavata, and broke the good news of the first discourse of Buddha Gotama.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;They had lived for aeons, but eventually the time came, </FONT><A HREF="#Notes"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">2,551 years ago</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">,³  when Gotama Buddha 
gave his first discourse to the five ascetics, with millions of celestial beings in attendance.
