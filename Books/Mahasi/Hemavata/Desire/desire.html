The God who punishes his creatures with death 
cannot be said to be free from ill-will. The wish for other’s death is, after all, an expression of anger, so it can never be accepted as mental purity.

Buddhahood, he rejected all aspects of craving through the path of arahantship.

When the drunken elephant, Nālāgiri, rushed to gore him, the Buddha was radiating pure love. So too, after Devadatta rolled down a huge rock upon him from a mountain. Even 
on such critical occasions his mind was free from negative emotions; nothing further needs to be said of other occasions. The Buddha, who had purified his mind of ill-will and anger through the path of arahantship, was always of pure mind, hence Sātāgiri’s answer.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In reply to the question “Has he overcome delusion?” — Sātāgiri said, “Our teacher, the Buddha, has

course includes heresy <I>(duccarita micchā ditthi).</I> This refers to the heresies propagated by the heretical leaders, Purāna Kassapa, and others.The Buddha exhorted his audience not to follow these wrong paths.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha said that heretical views like “Killing, stealing, and other unwholesome deeds do not 
produce bad effects” were due to attachment to the five aggregates: materiality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. He asserted that no one who knew the five aggregates were impermanent, unsatisfactory, and insubstantial could adopt such heresies.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha likened the views of a leading heretic, Makkhali Gosāla, to a dragnet and urged his disciples 
to reject the heresy. Let us briefly outline Makkhali’s view. According to him, no cause existed for either poverty or prosperity, and nothing could change or improve the situation, because all beings’ lives were predestined. They would each have their share of poverty and prosperity, and would be reborn in higher or lower realms according to predestination. Bad or foolish beings did not suffer any 
longer. Good or wise beings did not suffer for a shorter period. Each being was allotted a share of misery and happiness, of poverty and prosperity. Just as a rolling ball of thread stops when all the thread has unwound, the cycle of existences will end when each being has lived out a predestined period of existence.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This view of predestination asserts that one just has to live out one’s time, and need not try for 
improvement. The idea that one will mature automatically, suits those who are too lazy to do wholesome deeds, and those who delight in unwholesome deeds. It is an ideal philosophy for skivers and rogues. It also accords well with the current belief that those who have already attained human status will not sink any lower after death, but will gradually mature automatically. This belief is assumed in the Burmese term, “lu the lu phyit — man dies, becomes man.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Once one gets caught in the dragnet of Makkhali’s view, one cannot escape and has to die in it. The Buddha meant that those who favoured this view would not do any good volitional act that would enable them to attain celestial realms or nibbāna, so they would fall into hell.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">I have heard that some teachers maintain that it is enough merely to listen to what they preach, and 
practising meditation is unnecessary. Such preachers should take note of the metaphor of the dragnet used by the Buddha for Makkhali, the most blameworthy of the heretics. The views of Purāna Kassapa and Ajita Kesakambalī also fall into the category of ‘dragnet views,’ which preclude the possibility for beings to reach celestial realms, or to attain nibbāna.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="FalseViews"></A>The Origin of False Views</FONT>
</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When did the false views denying kamma and its effect originate? According to the Cakkavatti Sutta, they arose during the era in which man’s life-span was one thousand years. Until that era, people probably had less greed, anger, and delusion, and so were not enamoured of this argument about kamma. Since then, people became ever more depraved, and began to subscribe to these views. 
However, these views were not very popular, for even at the time of the Buddha, when the span of man’s life was reduced to one hundred years, they were not liked by many.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As moral standards are deteriorating, people are becoming more depraved, and false views are beginning to flourish. According to the Cakkavatti Sutta, in the future, when man’s expectation of life 
is reduced to just ten years, morality will disappear and even the expression ‘an unwholesome deed’ will become obsolete. The denial of the law of kamma is gradually gaining more acceptance because people’s hankering after sensual pleasures is increasing. Even today, some think that if one avoids unwholesome deeds, one will not achieve any useful purpose. This opinion leads people to wrong views.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

The Buddha realised this, so he exhorted people to strive hard to reduce greed and delusion. 
Those who follow the Buddha’s exhortation, try to gain realisation through meditation, and thus free themselves from wrong views. They come to realise that the kamma of previous existences has moulded the present existence, and that the kamma of the present existence, if not yet free of craving, will determine the next existence. Thus, they confirm their belief in right view.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha was obviously free of wrong view, but at a time when there were many bogus Buddhas, it 
was quite pertinent for Hemavata to ask whether the Buddha had overcome delusion.

Appearing before him, the Buddha gave him a discourse, and the monk attained arahantship.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The monk in this episode had been a goldsmith for five hundred existences, and naturally liked 
everything beautiful and delicate. He was not the least interested in contemplating decomposing corpses. Venerable Sāriputta did not know of his predisposition, and gave him an unsuitable object for contemplation. The Buddha, on the contrary, knew about the individual’s predisposition from previous lives, and so asked him to contemplate redness <I>(lohitakammatthāna)</I> after giving him a lotus of ruddy 
gold. Because of the Buddha’s very specific teaching, the monk could attain arahantship within a few hours.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the Buddha alone possessed these two kinds of insight, Sātāgiri replied definitely: “Our teacher, the Buddha, has the eye to see the Dhamma in all its aspects.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of the five kinds of eyes enumerated earlier, all except the physical eye, which needs no special 
mention, pertain to insights into the Dhamma. The Buddha possessed all four, hence Sātāgiri’s reply.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To reiterate, Sātāgiri said to his friend, Hemavata, that the Buddha was free from all desire and lust, was of pure mind, and had eradicated anger and ill-will through the Path of Non-returning (anāgāmi 
magga). This means that the Buddha’s mind was never sullied by feelings of anger or anxiety.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Incidentally, Venerable Sāriputta was praised for his patience. He was never angry. A certain brahmin could not believe this. He maintained that Venerable Sāriputta was never angry because nobody ever 
provoked his anger. So one day, while Venerable Sāriputta was on alms-round, he gave the Arahant’s back a hefty slap. Venerable Sāriputta did not even look back at him, and continued walking with composure. Only then did the unbelieving brahmin realise the truth, and he humbly begged the Venerable Sāriputta’s pardon. Not only Venerable Sāriputta, but all Arahants are free from anger. Yet they still have some idiosyncrasies that are vestiges of anger. Only the Buddha had eliminated all 
character traits. His mind was exceedingly pure.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sātāgiri said that the Buddha had overcome all aspects of delusion. Delusion means not understanding the Four Noble Truths, i.e. having wrong notions of them. For instance, regarding what is suffering <I>(dukkha) </I> as happiness <I>(sukha). </I> Since one is subject to the process of incessant arising and passing 
away, nothing is pleasant or stable. So there is no happiness at all, but only suffering. Yet delusion leads one to mistake suffering for happiness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Whatever is seen, heard, smelt, tasted, touched, or thought of is just mind and matter undergoing constant arising and passing away. However, delusion persuades one to regard these unstable 
phenomena as dependable and pleasant, which encourages one to be mentally attached to them. This attachment — the cause of suffering <I>(samudaya sacca) </I> leads to new existences. The cessation of existence is the truth of the end of suffering <I>(nirodha sacca),</I> but delusion makes one dislike it, because cessation is taken to mean the final death, and is therefore not relished.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Charity, morality, and mental culture are the basis for attaining nibbāna but delusion makes one dislike 
them. They are taken to be arduous. Likewise with the practice of insight meditation. This is the nature of delusion, which gives us wrong notions. Sātāgiri meant to say that the Buddha had overcome all aspects of delusion, and was free from delusion and ignorance.</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=690><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Notes"></A>Notes:</FONT></H4><OL><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
