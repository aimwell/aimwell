They dare not behave in a way that offends the spirits. Guardian spirits and ghosts do sometimes reveal their forms and frighten people. 
Many people report seeing them. Among the spirits that frighten people, some are celestial beings.

These beings were told by Kassapa Buddha, a previous Buddha, that they would obtain sustenance if they said <I>“sādhu”</I> (well done) when the king shared his merits gained from the 
wholesome deed of offering alms-food. So they gathered around the Buddha’s monastery and waited to say “sādhu.” Unfortunately, King Bimbisāra returned to his palace, forgetting to share his merit.

So the king offered alms-food to the Buddha and the Sangha again on the following day, sharing his merit with all beings. The hungry ghosts said “sādhu” and thus obtained celestial food.

Venerable Moggallāna replied simply that he had smiled because he 
saw the strange sight of hungry ghosts. Then the Buddha said, “My disciples have gained the eye of knowledge, and can therefore see what a human eye cannot, such as hungry ghosts. Now my disciples can bear witness to the fact that there are such beings. I myself, had seen them on the night when I was to attain Buddhahood while sitting on the seat under the Bodhi tree.

scepticism in this matter. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One strange ghost was a butcher in this city of Rājagiri. He had fallen into hell and suffered many hundreds of thousands of years before he became this ghost to work off the residue of his unwholesome deeds. Moggallāna was not mistaken when he said he had seen strange ghosts.” The 
Buddha continued to describe more than twenty kinds of ghosts. Some beings had to suffer pain from swords, lances, arrows and spikes that fell upon their bodies and pierced them. Some had lumps of iron of various sizes piercing their bodies and were running about, screaming from the excruciating pain they were suffering in the process. No other human being in that area could hear or see them, nor could Venerable Lakkhana, since he had not yet gained the divine eye. Such miserable beings were 
found not only on Vulture’s Peak, but elsewhere too, in places where they had done unwholesome deeds in their previous existences.

discourse, stating that he was the Fully Self-Enlightened One.

It cannot be attained by casual observation, but only by close observation of the processes as they occur, without 
missing any. Observation should be sustained on seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, etc., as they occur, without omitting anything. Initially one should observe one’s gross physical actions. The Buddha said in the Mahā Satipatthāna Sutta, <I>“Gacchantova gacchāmi’ ti, pajānāti </I>— as one goes, one knows ‘I am going.’” That means that one should observe the propelling force, or the element of motion <I>(vāyodhātu) </I>as one walks. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha continued, “As one sits, one knows ‘I am sitting.’” This means that as you are concentrating on the posture of sitting, you observe the mental and physical feelings generated by sitting. In the same way, you observe bending, stretching, moving, etc., as these actions occur. I have instructed you in the simple practice of observing the rising and falling of the abdomen as you sit 
in meditation. The Mahā Satipatthāna Sutta gives full instructions for observing the changing state of the body, so my instruction to observe the rising and falling of the abdomen while sitting accords with the discourse.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If you think that there is a gap between the rising and the falling of the abdomen, you can insert a 
mental note of the sitting posture, e.g. “rising, falling, sitting,” “rising, falling, sitting,” to make the observation continuous. This is observation of physical phenomena — <I>kāyānupassanā. </I>While sitting, if you feel tension, heat, or pain in the body, you should observe these feelings <I>(vedanā),</I> which is <I>vedanānupassanā. </I>If a thought occurs, you should note it, which is <I>cittānupassanā.</I> Observing the 
seeing, hearing, etc., as just a series of phenomena, is <I>dhammānupassanā.</I> Together, these four make up the practice of mindfulness meditation <I>(satipatthāna).</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As you practise these four foundations of mindfulness, your mind will cease to wander, and will become fully concentrated on the actions as they occur, without any omission. In this way the mind becomes 
purified, and you obtain purification of mind <I>(citta visuddhi). </I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">While in that state of purity, the object observed and the observing mind will become distinct phenomena. When you observe the rising of the abdomen, the rising itself is distinct from the mind that knows the rising. The same principle applies to the falling of the abdomen, the bending and stretching 
of the limbs, and so forth. The action and the noting mind become separate, i.e. the physical action, which knows nothing, and the knowing mind are seen as separate phenomena. In other words, the meditator can distinguish mentality from materiality. That stage of insight is called </FONT><A HREF="../../../../Books/Mahasi/Progress/progress.html#Analytical"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">analytical knowledge of mind and matter</FONT></A><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"> <I>(nāmarūpa-pariccheda-ñāna),</I> which is the foundation of insight knowledge. Without attaining this knowledge, the other stages of insight cannot be reached.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Going on with the practice, the meditator will come to discern the cause and effect of actions. For 
example, that the motion occurs because of the desire to move, that knowing occurs because of the object to be known, that seeing occurs because of the object to be seen, etc. The meditator will realise that the causes and effects are inherent in mind and matter, and that there is no other cause. This realisation is </FONT><A HREF="../../../../Books/Mahasi/Progress/progress.html#Conditionality"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">knowledge by discerning conditionality</FONT></A><FONT

For example, if pain arises, the meditator notes the pain as it occurs, e.g. “pain, pain, pain” until the pain disappears, 
noting the entire process from the beginning to the end. This noting of successive occurrences leads to the realisation of the three characteristics. These successive realisations are insight knowledge.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The noting mind becomes sharper and quicker as the meditator continues the practice. This kind of 
insight knowledge can be attained by an ordinary meditator, but for the Buddha, the attainment of insight knowledge was an easy matter since he had already attained jhāna and purification of mind.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="PsychicPowers"></A>Psychic Powers</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>Manomayiddhiand iddhividha-ñāna</I> are both powers for creating forms. <I>Manomayiddhi-ñāna</I> can create

We should not reside two in one place, but in solitude.” So they each began their solitary meditation retreats.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One day, Mātikamātā sent some butter, oil, and molasses to the monastery, but when she went with 
her retinue in the evening no monks were to be seen. Those who knew told her that the monks would come to the meeting place when a signal was given. They gave the signal and the monks assembled from their separate places of meditation, thinking that perhaps one of them had fallen sick, and needed help.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Mātikamātā misunderstood the situation, and asked, “Have you quarrelled?” The monks said they had 
not, and when asked why they did not come together as they did when they came to her house for alms-food, they said that they were living separately to practise the ascetic’s duties.

The monks 
explained that the anatomical parts of the body had to be contemplated to observe their decay and deterioration. She asked whether this Dhamma was exclusively for the monks or whether it could be practised by lay people. They said that it could be practised by anyone. Then Mātika Mātā asked the monks to give her instructions for meditation, and the instructions were given.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of course, that did not take more than an hour or two.

It is not known how many days she took to attain the path and fruition of non-returning, but she attained it before any of the monks. Simultaneously, she gained the four analytical knowledges <I>(patisambhidā-ñāna),</I> and the special knowledge of mind-reading
, referred to above. On reflection she discovered that the monks had not attained any jhāna or insight knowledge owing to lack of suitable food. So she had suitable food sent to the monks who, being properly nourished, practised meditation more vigorously and attained arahantship during the rainy season. From this story we can see that suitable, nourishing food is an important factor for meditators.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the rainy season was over, the sixty monks went to pay their respects to the Buddha at Jetavana monastery. They praised Mātikamātā in front of the Buddha, saying that she knew their minds and fulfilled their wishes. They were inspired to apply themselves to the meditation practice, and soon achieved concentration and insight. Hearing this, a certain monk wanted to go to that village to 
practise meditation. So he requested meditation instructions from the Buddha and went there.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When he reached the monastery, he thought to himself, “This woman is said to know others’ thoughts. I am tired from the journey, and cannot sweep the monastery. It would be good if she sent someone to sweep the monastery.” Mātikamātā knew the monk’s thoughts and so sent a man to sweep the 
monastery. Then the monk was thirsty and wanted to drink some sugar-cane juice. The drink was accordingly sent to him. On the following morning he wanted to eat meat salad and soft porridge, and his wishes were fulfilled.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">He then wanted to meet Mātikamātā, and, knowing his wish, she went to see him at the monastery, 
bringing alms-food. After eating the food, the monk asked her whether she was Mātikamātā. “Yes, reverend son,” she replied. When she asked him why he asked about her, the monk said that he did so because he had found that she knew his every wish. She replied modestly that many monks possessed similar powers. The monk then asked her directly whether she knew others’ thoughts. Mātika Mātā replied that those who possessed such powers behaved in such and such a way. Her reply was an 
indirect admission. This is the case with Noble Ones, they have no pride, and do not want to reveal their capabilities. When confronted with a direct question, they usually give an indirect reply.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the monk confirmed that Mātikamātā had the power to read others’ thoughts, he felt uneasy to 
reside in the monastery built by her charity. He thought that, being an ordinary person, he might entertain some unwholesome thoughts and desires. This woman would know his thoughts, so he would be found out, reprimanded, and put to shame. So he said that he was leaving the monastery.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">She asked him where he would go, and the monk replied that he would go back to the Buddha.

The Buddha realised that Mātikamātā’s monastery was the ideal place for such 
a monk, who was in the habit of entertaining unwholesome thoughts and desires. With the presence of Mātikamātā to curb his random thoughts, this monk would be constrained to achieve concentration. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some meditators need a meditation instructor who knows their thoughts.

The flighty mind alights on multifarious thoughts and desires. Unlike the body, the mind cannot be chained up or imprisoned.

five precepts besides having devotion to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. Of course, if all the five precepts could be observed properly, it would be much better. Besides that, if one could practise the meritorious deeds of charity, morality, and mental culture, it would be better still. Of the two kinds of meditation, bliss could be obtained in the realms of form <I>(rūpaloka) </I>and the formless realms <I>(arūpaloka)</I> through the practice of <I>samatha bhāvanā, </I>while insight meditation could lead one to the attainment of

those who do not bother to note the activities of the mind. If one’s imagination is given a free rein, fickle thoughts and desires multiply.

She saw the return of the monk by her special knowledge 
of mind-reading, and prepared suitable food, which she offered to him when he arrived. The monk resumed his meditation, and in just a few days became an Arahant. Not only the Buddha, but some lay persons like Mātikamātā possess the ability to read others’ thoughts.

In 1931 when I was in my eighth year as a monk, I had not done any meditation practice. I was then in search of a suitable meditation teacher and arrived at the monastery of Sayādaw U On Gaing, at 
Shweyaungpya Hill, near Donwun rail depot, in Thaton. This Sayādaw always practised austerity and did his meditation practice at a cemetery. He passed his nights there. He went from one cemetery to another near the villages where he went for his alms-food.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When I arrived at the Sayādaw’s monastery, I went along with his disciples who were following him to 
a cemetery. Before long, the Sayādaw was approached by some villagers with a request that he go and keep watch on the grave of a freshly buried corpse. The corpse was that of a fifteen-year-old suicide. The villagers asked the Sayādaw to watch over the grave and guard it against possible exhumation by black magicians who were usually out to cut the wrists off the corpses of suicides to use them in their black magic.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Sayādaw and his disciples, including myself, accepted the offer and went to that cemetery. All eight of us got to the cemetery just before sunset. Mats were spread around the grave, and pots of drinking water were set out at convenient places. When we took our seats, I was nearest the grave, only about a yard away. Other monks were experienced, but I was not. It was my first time at a 
cemetery, so I felt uneasy. However, I could not change places with any other monk because I was the most senior of the Sayādaw’s disciples. The other monks recited the Metta Sutta and lay down to sleep. I didn’t lie down; I didn’t dare. I remembered the words in the Visuddhimagga to the effect that ogres usually haunted a grave and sat near the corpse. I had to sit tight for four nights controlling my 
thoughts for fear that the guardian deities of the cemetery and the ogres, who were near the corpse, would probably know my thoughts and frighten me. So my thoughts were kept within limits. From this experience I surmise that the monk near Mātika Mātā was obliged to control his mind and keep it pure, enabling him to attain arahantship quickly.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="DivineEar"></A>The Divine Ear</FONT>

the one who keeps this morality will be duly protected by it. This morality protects the one who keeps it from the misfortunes arising in the present and future existences in the cycle of rebirth. For lay people, Pātimokkha samvara sīla means the five precepts, but for monks it is the 227 precepts (or ninety billion precepts in detail).

practising one kind of meditation or another. Otherwise, it can be observed with only partial success.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Moderation in Food <I>(bhojane mattaññutā).</I> This is the reflection when eating, or receiving alms-food, or using medicinal requisites. For example, when taking food, one must reflect as the 
Buddha instructed, “When one has delicious food, one should not delight in it; when, however, one has poor food, one should not be disappointed. One should overcome all reactions, whether good or bad.”</FONT></DIV></LI></OL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Eating is not for pleasure, nor for intoxication, nor to become plump and good-looking. One eats merely 
to sustain oneself, to be relieved of hunger — for lack of nourishment causes suffering and ill-health. One has to be healthy to practise as strenuously as the Buddha exhorted. So in eating one must know the right amount.

Jagariya </I> means ‘to be alert’ and <I>anuyoga</I> means ‘to make 
an effort.’ It refers to moderation in sleep, and to keeping one’s mind and body alert. Of course, this means for practising meditation. If one is busy doing other things, the purpose will not be achieved. Once, a monk told me that when he was awake, his mind used to entertain so many unwholesome thoughts that he was obliged to sleep as long as possible. What he said makes some sense. If one harbours unwholesome thoughts while awake, one will be accumulating 
demerit. So saying that one who is asleep has less chance of harbouring unwholesome thoughts seems reasonable. What this rule of conduct means is that, one must be active in meditation practice. The Buddha said that by exerting oneself in meditation by walking and sitting throughout the day, one could be free from the thoughts that preclude mindfulness and concentration, and thus one’s mind would be kept pure.</FONT></DIV></LI></OL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

One should keep alert by alternately walking, sitting, or sometimes standing throughout 
the day until 10:00 pm. Then for four hours one may lie down to sleep to maintain one’s health. However, until one falls asleep, one should continue with the meditation. Then one should wake up at two in the morning and resume meditation. Of the six parts of one day, one should sleep only one part and keep awake for the remaining five, engaging in meditation.

The Brāhmana and Khattiya classes were regarded as noble, and superior to the Vessa and Sudda classes, who were the commoners. There were also various clans. The Kosiya and Bhāradvāja clans were inferior to the Gotama and Moggallāna clans. You may have heard about the avoidance of contact with 
beggars, scavengers, etc., who are called ‘untouchables.’ These ‘untouchables’ had to live in a village of their own outside the city. When they walked about in the city they had to tap the ground with a stick so that the higher castes could avoid physical contact with them. In the story of Mātanga the rich man’s daughter, Ditthamangalikā, happened to see the beggar Mātanga and, saying that it was 
inauspicious, she turned back from a picnic. So the rich man’s servants beat Mātanga.

Such beliefs are embodied in their scriptures and are mentioned in the Buddhist books as well. In Sri Lanka a caste division exists too, but it is not so 
strict. In Sri Lanka, a monk born of a high caste family does not pay respects to a monk born of a low caste family, and a monk from a low caste may be diffident towards high caste laymen.

morality. When the Buddha expounded the Four Noble Truths, Suppabuddha contemplated them and became a Stream-winner.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After the meeting had ended, Suppabuddha went away as the crowd dispersed. Then a little later, he came back to the Buddha. The king of celestial beings, wanting to test Suppabuddha’s integrity said, 
“Hey, Suppabuddha. You are very poor and stricken with leprosy. You have no one to rely on. If you obey me, I will give you great wealth and cure your disease.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Suppabuddha replied, “Who are you? What are your instructions?”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The king of celestial beings said, “I am the king of celestial beings. Gotama, who has been giving 
discourses, is not a true Buddha. His disciples are not true bhikkhus. You must say, ‘I don’t take refuge in the Buddha; I don’t take refuge in the Dhamma; I don’t take refuge in the Sangha.’”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Suppabuddha retorted, “You are too rude to be the king of celestial beings. You shouldn’t be talking 
with me. Why do you say that I am very poor and have no refuge? I am now a true son of the Buddha. I am not poor. I am now wealthy and noble because I am fully endowed with the seven treasures of the good and noble, namely, confidence <I>(saddhā),</I> morality <I>(sīla), </I>shame of unwholesome deeds <I>(hirī),</I> fear of unwholesome deeds <I>(ottappa), </I>being well-informed <I>(bahusacca), </I>liberality <I>(cāga), </I>and wisdom <I>(paññā), </I>as enumerated by the Buddha. You are not fit to hold conversation with me.” Saying thus, he 
sent the king of celestial beings away.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Suppabuddha went to the Buddha and reported his realisation of the Dhamma to him. It is the same with present-day meditators who are eager to report their meditation experiences to the instructor. After Suppabuddha had made his report to the Buddha, he went away. As his past kamma dictated, 
Suppabuddha was gored to death by a cow on his return from the Buddha’s monastery. He became a deva in the celestial abode of Tāvatimsa, where he had powers superior to those of devas who had reached Tāvatimsa through merits done outside the Buddha’s dispensation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">These devas were disgruntled. They said that although Suppabuddha was among the lowliest in his life 
as a human being, he held a position higher than theirs. The king of devas explained why Suppabuddha had attained a higher position. He said that in his human existence Suppabuddha had fulfilled the seven duties of the good and noble, and so in this existence as a deva he was endowed with the benefits of his previous meritorious deeds.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This story illustrates that a highly attained person is more noble than others, although he or she may 
occupy a lowly position in secular society. Suppabuddha had fulfilled the seven duties for only a few hours before his death, but he possessed the attributes of knowledge and conduct. He had been a leper because in a previous existence he had called a Pacceka Buddha a leper. He was gored by a cow because in a previous existence he had robbed and killed a prostitute. The Buddha, referring to Suppabuddha’s fate, warned the audience to avoid unwholesome deeds just as one avoids obstacles 
and pot-holes while walking. Meditators should take the moral of this story to heart and shun unwholesome deeds.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then Hemavata asked, “Is your teacher, the Buddha, free from lust and desires? Is he also free from future existence?”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sātāgiri replied: “Our teacher, the Buddha, is free from lust and desires. For him there is no future 
existence.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If one is not free from lust and desires, one will have a new existence and suffer from birth, old age, disease, and other kinds of misery, although one may have the attributes of knowledge and conduct. Only when there is no more existence will one be rid of all miseries. These two points are very important.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

As she was filled with joy, she practised 
meditation spontaneously and soon reached the stage of a Stream-winner. In due course, she gave birth to a child who later became </FONT><A HREF="http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/sona.htm"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Venerable Sonakutikanna</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">.² Kālī was the first woman to become a 
Stream-winner. She achieved that distinction on overhearing the attributes of the Buddha and thus having firm confidence in him. Later she received the highest honour from the Buddha because of her firm confidence in the Buddha.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Hemavata, too, became confident of the attributes of the Buddha and was eager in the adoration of 
the Buddha. He said to his friend, Sātāgiri, “The mind of the Buddha is perfectly pure. His physical and mental behaviour is also free of faults; the Buddha has all the attributes of knowledge and conduct. I adore him.”</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=690><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Notes"></A>Notes</FONT></H4><OL><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
