Thus, unexpectedly — as death so often comes — this publication has turned out to be a memorial issue in honour of one of the outstanding contemporary teachers of 
Theravāda Buddhism, especially in the field of insight meditation <I>(Vipassanā).</I> It was not long before he passed away that the Venerable Sayādaw had conveyed his consent to a compilation of his thoughts and observations, chiefly on insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The selections here presented have been taken from sermons of the Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw dealing with various Suttas (Discourses 
of the Buddha). The sermons had been delivered in the Burmese language and were translated into English by various hands. A set of seven books containing these English translations was published in 1980 by the Buddha Sāsana Nuggaha Organization of Rangoon (“Sāsana Yeikthā”), which gave its kind permission for extracts from these books to be reproduced in the present anthology. These selections have been slightly edited, and references to their sources are given after each extract. A 
short biography of the Venerable Author is also included here.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In issuing this anthology, it is hoped that the sayings will be found instructive and inspiring, and that they will stimulate the reader to take up earnestly the threefold cultivation of morality, meditation, and wisdom, reaching their culmination in liberating insight wisdom.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It was a direct approach to that liberating insight <I>(vipassanā)</I> which the Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw taught for many decades to a very large number of meditators from East and West. Based on the “Foundations of Mindfulness” <I>(satipatthāna),</I> he devised an effective method of meditative practice, partly derived from tradition and his own teachers, and partly evolved by himself. This method certainly demanded, or led to, a high degree of mental concentration, but did not require the prior attainment of full meditative absorption, the jhānas. Yet, as some of the extracts in this book will show, the Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw was fully aware of the great significance of full concentration of mind in the jhānas, and he neither discouraged their cultivation nor belittled their value. But as a wise and compassionate Teacher, he wanted to help those who, for psychological or environmental reasons, would have been faced with a long and frustrating struggle in their attempts to gain jhānic concentration.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">For such a person, the method of direct insight practice could open an access to the core of the Teaching by direct meditative experience. In the course of the diligent practice of that method, there would follow a natural growth of mindfulness and concentration, of inner firmness and calm, which would place the meditator in a better position to attain to the jhānas.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In conclusion, the undersigned wishes to express his humble respect to the late Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw, and his deep-felt gratitude for the guidance and inspiration he received from him.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">— Nyanaponika<BR>Forest Hermitage<BR>Kandy, Sri Lanka<BR>September 1982</FONT></P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"

founder of the last Burmese dynasty.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At the age of six he began his studies at a monastic school in his village, and at the age of twelve he was ordained a sāmanera (novice), receiving the name of Sobhana. On reaching the age of twenty, he was ordained a bhikkhu on 26 November 1923. He passed the Government Pāli Examinations in all the three classes (lower, middle, and highest) in the 
following three successive years.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the fourth year of his bhikkhu ordination, he proceeded to Mandalay, noted for its pre-eminence in Buddhist studies, where he continued his further education under various monks of high scholastic fame. In the fifth year he went to Moulmein where he took up the work of teaching the Buddhist scriptures at a monastery known as Taung-waing-galay Taik Kyaung.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the eighth year after his bhikkhu ordination, he and another monk left Moulmein equipped with the bare necessities of a bhikkhu (i.e., almsbowl, a set of three robes, etc.), and went in search of a clear and effective method in the practice of meditation. At Thaton he met the well-known Meditation Teacher, the Venerable U Nārada, who is also known as Mingun Jetawun Sayādaw the First. He then 
placed himself under the guidance of the Sayādaw and at once proceeded with an intensive course of meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">He had progressed so well in his practice that he was able to teach the method effectively to his first three disciples in Seikkhun while he was on a visit there in 1938. These three lay disciples, too, made remarkable progress. Inspired by the example of these three, gradually as 
many as fifty villagers joined the courses of intensive practice.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Venerable Mahāsi could not stay with the Venerable Mingun Sayādaw as long as he wanted as he was urgently asked to return to the Moulmein monastery. Its aged head monk was gravely ill and passed away not long after the Venerable Mahāsi’s return. The Venerable Mahāsi was then asked to take charge of the monastery and 
to resume teaching the resident monks. During this time he sat for the Pāli Lectureship Examination on its first introduction by the Government of Burma. Passing this examination on the first attempt, in 1941 he was awarded the title of Sāsanadhaja Sri Pavāra Dhammācariya.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On the event of the Japanese invasion, the authorities gave an evacuation order to those living near Moulmein at the 
Taung-waing-galay Monastery and its neighbourhood. These places were close to an airfield and hence exposed to air attacks. For the Sayādaw this was a welcome opportunity to return to his native Seikkhun and to devote himself wholeheartedly to his own practice of Vipassanā meditation and to the teaching of it to others.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">He took residence at a monastery known as <B>Mahā-Si</B>-Kyaung, 
which was thus called because a drum (Burmese <B>si</B>) of an unusually large (<B>mahā</B>) size was housed there. From that monastery, the Sayādaw’s popular name, Mahāsi Sayādaw, is derived.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It was during this period, in 1945, that the Sayādaw wrote his great work, Manual of Vipassanā Meditation, a comprehensive and authoritative treatise expounding both the doctrinal and the 
practical aspects of the Satipatthāna method of meditation. This work of two volumes, comprising 858 pages in print, was written by him in just seven months, while the neighbouring town of Shwebo was at times subjected to almost daily air attacks. So far, only one chapter of this work, the fifth, has been translated into English and is published under the title “Practical Insight Meditation: Basic and Progressive Stages” (Buddhist Publication Society).</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It did not take long before the reputation of Mahāsi Sayādaw as an able teacher of insight meditation <I>(Vipassanā)</I> had spread throughout the Shwebo-Sagaing region and attracted the attention of a prominent and very devout Buddhist laymen, Sir U Thwin, who was regarded as Burma’s Elder Statesman. It was his wish to promote the inner strength of Buddhism in Burma by setting up a meditation censer to be guided by a meditation teacher of proven virtue and ability. After meeting Mahāsi Sayādaw and listening to a discourse given by him and to the meditation instructions given to nuns in Sagaing, Sir U Thwin was in no doubt that he had found the ideal person he was looking for.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In 1947 the Buddha Sāsana Nuggaha Organization² was founded in Rangoon with Sir U Thwin as its first President and with its object the furthering of the study <I>(pariyatti)</I> and practice <I>(patipatti)</I> of Buddhism. In 1948 Sir U Thwin donated five acres of land at Kokine, Rangoon, to the organization for the erection of a meditation censer. It is on this site that the present Thāthana (or Sāsana) Yeikthā, i.e., ”Buddhist Retreat,” is situated, which now, however, covers an area of twenty acres, with a large number of buildings.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In 1949, the then Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, and Sir U Thwin requested that the Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw come to Rangoon and give training in meditational practice. On 4 December 1949, the Sayādaw introduced the first group of 25 meditators into the methodical practice of Vipassanā meditation. Within a few years of the Sayādaw’s arrival in Rangoon, similar meditation bonkers sprang up 
all over Burma, until they numbered over one hundred. In neighbouring Theravāda countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka such bonkers were also established in which the same method was taught and practised. According to a 1972 census, the total number of meditators trained at all these bonkers (both in Burma and abroad) had passed the figure of seven hundred thousands. In the East and in several Western countries as well, Vipassanā courses continue to be conducted.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At the historic Sixth Buddhist Council (Chattha Sangāyana) held at Rangoon for two years, culminating in the year 2500 Buddhist Era (1956), the Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw had an important role. He was one of the Final Editors of the canonical texts, which were recited and thereby approved, in the sessions of the Council. Further, he was the Questioner (Pucchakā) — that is, he had to ask the questions concerning the 
respective canonical texts that were to be recited. They were then answered by an erudite monk with a phenomenal power of memory, by the name of Venerable Vicittasārābhivamsa. To appreciate fully the importance of these roles, it may be mentioned that at the First Council held one hundred days after the passing away of the Buddha, it was the Venerable Mahā Kassapa who put forth those introductory questions which were then answered by the venerable Upāli and the Venerable Ananda.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After the recital of the canonical scriptures, the Tipitaka, had been completed at the Sixth Council, it was decided to continue with a rehearsal of the ancient commentaries and subcommentaries, preceded by critical editing and scrutiny. In that large task, too, the Sayādaw took a prominent part.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In 
the midst of all of these tasks, he was also a prolific and scholarly writer. He authored more than 70 writings and translations, mostly in Burmese, with a few in the Pāli language. One of these deserves to be singled out: his Burmese translation of the Commentary to the Visuddhimagga (Visuddhimagga Mahā-Tika), which, in two large volumes of the Pāli original, is even more voluminous than the work commented upon, and presents many difficulties, linguistically and in its contents. In 1957 
Mahāsi Sayādaw was awarded the title of Aggamahāpandita.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Yet even all of this did not exhaust the Sayādaw’s remarkable capacity for work in the cause of the Buddha-Dhamma. He undertook several travels abroad. The first two of his tours were in preparation for the Sixth Council, but were likewise used for preaching and teaching:</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

meditative life which had enabled him to give wise guidance to those instructed by him. His outstanding vigour of body and mind and his deep dedication to the Dhamma sustained him through a life of 78 years.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On 14 August 1982, the Venerable Mahasi Sayādaw succumbed to a sudden and severe heart attack which he had suffered the night before. Yet on the evening of the 13th, he had still given 
an introductory explanation to a group of new meditators.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Venerable Mahāsi Sayādaw was one of the very rare personalities in whom there was a balanced and high development of both profound erudition linked with a keen intellect, and deep and advanced meditative experience. He was also able to teach effectively both Buddhist thought and Buddhist practice.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">His long career of teaching through the spoken and printed word had a beneficial impact on many hundreds of thousands in the East and in the West.

of teaching relating to the Middle Way or the Eightfold Path: the practice of morality, concentration, and acquisition of profound knowledge, and the Four Noble Truths.

Knowledge, it is said, is accomplishment; and there is no need for anyone to practice Dhamma once knowledge has been attained. Such a statement virtually amounts to the 
rejection of the practice of the Dhamma, to the exclusion of the Noble Eightfold Path. But in point of fact, the Noble Eightfold Path is to be constantly practised, for it is a set of disciplines to be cultivated (bhavetabbā) which can generate the power to gain insight into the nature of the Path. Without effort, nothing comes up naturally. And yet there is a school of thought which wrongly suggests that making an effort itself is dukkha or unsatisfactoriness, and that therefore, it should 
not be indulged in. In the face of such dogma who will be prepared to take the trouble of meditating upon the Noble Eightfold Path and practice its tenets? If there is no one to practice this Dhamma, how can its light shine within him? And in the absence of any insight into the nature of the Path, how can one eliminate defilements and attain Nibbānic peace?</FONT></P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">— Discourse on To Nibbāna via the Noble Eightfold Path</FONT>

He must do everything himself. When he feels hot, he cools himself and when he feels cold, he warms himself up. He has 
to be careful to keep up his health and well-being. When he takes a walk, he sees that he does not stumble. When he travels, he sees that he meets no danger.

Then he will be able to distinguish the nāma, or the mind that knows, and the rūpa, or body that is known. Then he will come to realise the absence of the thing called atta or self, or “I” Repeating noting will lead him on to the knowledge of the causes and effects of nāma and 
rūpa. In the end, the idea of self will be utterly destroyed. Before the practice of mindfulness he might be wondering if a self existed in the past, and is still existing at the present moment, and will exist in the future. After the Vipassanā-practice all such doubts will be resolved as the true nature of the phenomena is understood.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the meditator continues noting, he will find that 
the sense-objects, together with the consciousness directed at them, vanish. They are all impermanent. They just arise and pass away of their own accord. What is not permanent is not satisfactory. Nothing is substantial. Then, what is there to cling to as “I” or ”Mine?” All phenomena are in a state of flux, now arising, now passing away.

This 
he does with an effort; and that is the Right Effort. Then he has to keep his mind on what he has noted so as to be aware of it. And that is the Right Mindfulness. As he has to be mindful, his mind will have to be fixed or concentrated on the object. And that is the Right Concentration. These three constituents of the Path <I>(magga)</I> — Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration — are grouped under the heading of concentration <I>(samādhi);</I> they are the <I>samādhi magga. </I>Then 
there is the process of thinking out what existence really is, which is classified as Right Thinking or Right Thought. As a result of this right thinking, we have the Right View. These two are grouped under the heading of wisdom <I>(paññā);</I> they are the <I>paññā magga.</I> All these five in the <I>samādhi</I> and <I>paññā</I> sections are together classified as <I>karaka magga,</I> or the activators, which combine their efforts in the process of simultaneously noting and knowing.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood constitute the section on virtue; they are the sīla magga, which may generally be deemed to have been fulfilled before the meditator takes up insight-meditation. During the period of meditation, these three <I>sīla magga</I> (path-factors of virtue) remain unpolluted; in fact they get more and more purified as time goes on. With these three in this group added to the five in the previous groups, we have the eight Path factors as appearing in <I>Vipassanā</I> (and hence called <I>vipassanā magga</I>) on which we are to meditate.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Again, in the development of insight meditation, basic qualities of the elementary Path <I>(mula magga)</I> must be fulfilled. Of them, the first and foremost is the firm conviction that beings are the responsible “owners of their actions” <I>(kammassakata sammāditthi),</I> a view well established in the law of kamma. Only when a meditator has absolute faith in this law of action and its consequences, can he practice Vipassanā. He must believe that the result of carrying out Vipassanā or meditation exercises can lead him to the Path, to its fruition and finally to Nibbāna. It is only with this faith that he will be able to exert Right effort.</FONT>
