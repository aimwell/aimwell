They contain many Pali words which, though familiar to those who have heard regular discourses, 
may not be so familiar to others. I have prepared this edition of the “Discourse on the Nature of Nibbāna” bearing in mind that it will be read by many who may be unfamiliar with Pali terms. In this book especially, the Sayādaw uses many terms from the Abhidhamma. I have given the Pali (in parenthesis), at least the first time the term is used, and in some cases I have used the Pali term for the sake of brevity, such as jhāna for the state of deep concentration usually translated as 
“absorption.” </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The translation “suffering” is a very unsatisfactory translation for the Pali term<I> “dukkha.”</I> Although the term does embrace all kinds of obvious suffering like physical pain, mental sorrow, and grief, it means much more. Even pleasure and joy are <I>dukkha,</I> because they are subject to instability, must be striven for, and are the cause of grief when they change. The term<I> “dukkha</I>” 
has been translated as “unsatisfactoriness” in most places.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the footnotes, references are to the page numbers of the Pali texts of the Pali Text Society which, in the translations, are given at the top of the page or sometimes in the body of the text. However, in the case of the Dhammapada or Apadāna, references are given to verse numbers.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The discourses were delivered in Burmese, and were then published as books in Burmese. These were later translated to English and published. I have done my best to adapt them for print by removing some repetitions and ﬁlling in some elisions that are common in discourses, but unsuitable for books. I have added some footnotes to explain some terms that, though understood by a Burmese audience, would mean little to others. </FONT>

insight meditation and also how the peace of nibbāna is achieved while practising insight meditation. Wherever the Pāḷi text and Commentaries are difficult to understand, the Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw has given precise and clear explanation. He offers lucid instructions to those meditators following a wrong path with erroneous views to enable them to tread on the Right Path. To cite an example, the Sayādaw has clearly instructed that if, at the beginning of the exercise in meditation 
when every phenomenon that takes place at the six sense-doors cannot possibly be noted, one of the more obvious bodily behaviours should be noted first, e.g., while walking, the act of walking and manoeuvring of limbs should first be observed and noted; as also in respect of other bodily actions. The most obvious physical phenomenon — the rising and falling of the abdomen — is emphasized for the meditator, to note. When concentration gains momentum all other phenomena occurring at the six 
sense-doors may be noted.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In this series of discourses the concept of nibbāna has been fully elucidated beginning from the attainment of the stage of sa-upādisesa nibbāna up to the final destination of anupādisesa nibbāna arrived at by death called ‘parinibbāna.’ Further explanation given is, “Buddha has taught that with the achievement of the stage of Arahantship when 
defilements have ceased to exist, the remnant of material aggregates, still remains and that this state is known as sa-upādisesa. After the demise or ‘parinibbāna’ of an Arahant, both the remnant of physical aggregates and defilements cease to exist and all matter, mind, and mental formations become extinct. This complete cessation and extinction is known as anupādisesa nibbāna.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Here, 
as in all his discourses or articles on Dhamma, the Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw makes a dual exposition of the theoretical aspect of the Dhamma based on scriptures <I>(pariyatti),</I> and the practical aspect of insight meditation exercises <I>(patipatti),</I> thereby affording meditators a comprehensive knowledge of the Dhamma. Mention has also been made of the burden of the five aggregates of attachment and the burden of unwholesome Dhamma <I>(abhisankhāra)</I>, and the method of throwing 
down the burdens to escape all sufferings arising from craving, with rebirth ensuing.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Venerable Sayādaw has made it clear in plain language that new existence is the resultant effect of wholesome and unwholesome kamma, merits and demerits. Past actions or previous activities are known as kamma; their results are called <I>vipāka</I> in Pāli. The new existence that has arisen causes the formation of the mental and physical aggregates, which brings forth defilements. Defilements of all forms generate kamma. The kamma of the past has created the conditions of the present, while the kamma of the present is creating the conditions that will exist in the future. As long as this kammic force exists there is rebirth. To get rid of defilements, kamma, and the resultant effects, efforts should be made to practise generosity <I>(dāna),</I> morality <I>(sīla),</I> and meditation <I>(bhāvanā)</I> with special emphasis on the insight type of meditation exercise to eventually gain Path and Fruition knowledge, and nibbāna. On attaining the Path and Fruition of Arahantship, all kamma with its results would cease.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In so far as the doctrine of nibbāna is concerned, the Buddha has taught us that nibbāna is a state which is the natural and inevitable result of the extinction of cravings. Among the forms of craving that must be rooted out, is the longing for continued separate existence in this life and hereafter.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are a number of current views according to different schools of thought concerning nibbāna. Some probably think that nibbāna is a celestial palace, or an abode of tremendous dimensions, a big city or a radiance of a spectacular dazzling light. Some hold the view that it is a state in which the individual soul is completely absorbed in the universal soul, etc. These are all wishful thinking arising out of ignorance.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Venerable Nāgasena, the great Buddhist philosopher, compares nibbāna to a lotus flower and concludes by saying: “If you ask, how nibbāna is to be known, I say it is to be known by freedom from distress and danger, by confidence, by peace, by calm, by bliss, by happiness, by delicacy, by purity by freshness.” (Milinda Pañha)</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Sire, nibbāna is. It is cognisable by mind thus purified, lofty, straight, without obstructions, without temporal desires. There is nibbāna; but it is not possible to show by colour or configuration.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Nibbāna, after all, aims at making our life serene by extinguishing all forms of craving. The very idea of nibbāna is 
the state of mind coexistent with this serenity. It is in the Buddhist conception of nibbāna that we have the most complete analysis of the Universe. No real peace and happiness is possible unless a man is free from the selfish desire and egoism caused by the threefold craving. It is the way out of this craving the attainment of eternal peace that is taught by the Buddhist doctrine of nibbāna as the supreme destiny awaiting all humanity.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The first and the last word on nibbāna was said by Nāgasena in one phrase: “nibbāna is!” For no discussion with the finite mind will enable one to cognise the infinite. It cannot be conceived; it can only be experienced.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It is hoped that after going through this book thoroughly, one will find what nibbāna means without any 
ambiguity. The Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw has explained it in unequivocal terms which may be summarised as: nibbāna is eternal peace. It is brought about by attaining the Path of Arahantship that can be acquired by following the right path through the actual practice of insight meditation. All traces of defilements, kamma, and effects of kamma are completely obliterated and eradicated when one attains nibbāna. With this accomplishment a state is reached whereby all cravings cease on the 
attainment of parinibbāna. This is the end of all suffering.</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;</FONT></P></TD><TD WIDTH=256><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Min Swe (Secretary )<BR>Buddha sasana Nuggaha Organization <BR>Mahāsī Sāsana Yeikthā, Rangoon.</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"

references to the catechism of Visākha the millionaire, and Dhammadinnā Therī, the Arahant bhikkhuṇī. “What,” asked the former, “is the sensation of pleasure like?” The latter answered: “It is like the sensation of pain.” </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Pleasure and pain are diametrically opposed to each other; but what the bhikkhuṇī wished to impress upon Visākha is that they are the same kinds of 
phenomena.

For instance, greed and anger can be known at once as soon as they assert themselves, but when ignorance is at work it does not reveal itself clearly. Thus indifference is very much like ignorance in its manifestation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><B>Q</B> WHAT IS ignorance like?<BR><B>A</B> IT IS like knowledge.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Knowledge, 
here, means the knowledge of the Path possessed by the Worthy Ones, while ignorance means covering up of that knowledge.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Nibbāna means extinction or annihilation. What is extinguished or annihilated? The cycle of suffering in the realm of defilements <I>(kilesa vatta),</I> of actions (kamma <I>vatta),</I> and the result of action <I>(vipāka vatta)</I> is extinguished or annihilated. The realm of defilement encompasses ignorance <I>(avijjā)</I>, craving <I>(tanh</I>ā), and attachment <I>(upādāna).</I> The realm of action includes both meritorious and demeritorious deeds that contribute to the emergence of the endless cycle of rebirths. The realm of the result of action, usually called vipāka, relates to the consequences of actions, good or bad. Every action produces a resultant of mind, matter, six sense-bases, feeling etc. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking are all manifestations of the result of action.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Failure to gain insight knowledge, which recognises the real nature of existence, when one sees or hears something, is ignorance. When one declares that one sees or hears something, one does so with the wrong notion that it is actually one’s ego that sees or hears, but, in fact, there is no ego. This wrong notion deludes one into believing that things are permanent, pleasing, or satisfactory. It 
thus gives rise to craving, which, as it intensifies, develops into attachment. This is how defilement builds up its own empire.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As soon as attachment to sense-objects develops, efforts must be made to satisfy the desire for those sense-objects. Then volitional activities <I>(sankhāra)</I> would start operating. In the present context they may be called kamma-formations, for they are responsible for forming or shaping actions. When, as a result of such formations, death takes place in the course of existence, it is inevitably followed by rebirth, for rebirth-linking consciousness <I>(patisandhi citta)</I> arises following decease-consciousness <I>(cuticitta).</I> Death is followed by becoming. In other words, a new life begins. This, it may be said, is a resultant of kamma formations, which repeatedly bring forth consciousness, mind and matter, six sense-bases, contract, feeling, etc. Dependent, on the cycle of results, there arises the cycle of defilements; and dependent on the cycle of defilements, there arises the cycle of actions. The revolution of these three cycles is incessant throughout the endless cycle of existence. It is only when insight knowledge is applied to the practice of noting the phenomena of arising and passing away of the aggregates that Path-consciousness develops and nibbāna is brought near. At this stage, ignorance, with its faithful attendant, defilement, is annihilated. In the absence of defilement, no fresh actions or kammas can be formed. Any residual kamma that happens to exist after the annihilation of defilement will be rendered inoperative or ineffective. For a Worthy One, an Arahant, no new life is formed after his decease-consciousness. There is now a complete severance of the fetter of existence which signifies annihilation in sight of nibbāna. Hence, the definition of nibbāna runs thus:</FONT>

Hence cessation of suffering is nibbāna.”<BR>In other words, when the Path of Arahantship is reached, the cycle of 
suffering ceases. Nibbāna is thus the peace established with the annihilation of suffering. For the sake of brevity, please note only this — nibbāna is synonymous with absolute peace. Annihilation brings about complete elimination of the cycles of defilement, action, and the results of action. The Commentaries say that the state of peace <I>(santi)</I> is a characteristic of nibbāna. When this cooling occurs the embers of suffering are extinguished. What is to be noted with diligence is the complete annihilation of the three cycles of defilement, action, and result of action, which all go to create mind and matter, volitional activities, etc.</FONT>

Once freed from their shackles, the Arahant commits no evil whatsoever, 
although Arahants continue to perform actions that normally produce merits. An Arahant does good in a number of ways. For instance, teaching the Dhamma, or listening attentively to others teaching it. An Arahant regularly pays homage to the Buddha and senior monks, gives away surplus food and robes to those in need, and practises morality, concentration, and insight meditation with devotion. However, as an Arahant has no defilements, these meritorious deeds are ineffective and produce no 
kamma. All the good that the Arahant does produces no results. In the absence of new kamma, no new existence arises for one who has completed the path.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">I notice that some misinformed laymen misinterpret the texts and teach their followers that one should not perform meritorious deeds, because Arahants usually don’t.

would not be acquiring any merit; instead, they would be doing things that will lead them to the lower realms. They may purposely avoid doing good. That may not do them any harm, because that avoidance produces no reactions. However, once they give way to evil deeds, the tendency would be to indulge in them without qualms or remorse, having been instigated by greed, anger, ignorance, pride, and wrong views. Evil actions would inevitably result in equally evil results, in which case they will 
gain admittance to lower realms after death.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Calling A Halt to Kamma</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If you really want to call a halt to new actions arising on the passing away of the old, you must practise insight meditation with a view to realising the Path and its Fruition.

Before you are able to take note of all that is happening at the six sense-doors, you should, at the beginning, note any physical movement that is easily noticeable. For instance, if you are walking, begin the practice with noting the phenomenon of walking. If you are sitting be aware of your posture of sitting. Begin with the 
physical movement which is, as I have said, easily knowable. We advise the meditators to note the rising and falling of the abdomen as they breathe in and out. While noting its movement your mind may wander. You may think about this and that, or you may imagine things. Note this thinking or imagining. You may feel tired — note this tiredness. You may feel hot or painful as you exert — note the arising and passing away of these sensations. Note the phenomenon of seeing as you see, or 
hearing as you hear.

When your mind wanders, note its wandering. As you repeatedly note 
phenomena, your power of concentration will get stronger, and your mind, unable to get away from the object that you are noting, will be at one with it. At times you may imagine things. Note this at once and eventually you will get familiar with the process of thinking. As soon as you are aware of this process, stop thinking about it and bring your mind to the rising and falling of the abdomen. Now you will come to realise that your mind noting the object at the present moment has been 
preceded by your mind doing similarly in the past, and that it is being followed by your mind which will be doing similarly at the next moment. As it is all the time wholly occupied with the act of noting the object, it will get purified, and this is called purification of mind <I>(citta visuddhi).</I></FONT><I></I></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Purification of View</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

This clarity brings one to the realisation that the noting mind is distinct from the sense-objects that are being noted. After repeated exercises, a meditator will arrive at the conclusion that there are only two things in this entire process of noting — the knowing mind and the object known. At this stage, knowledge regarding the 
true nature of phenomena through analysis of the aggregates into mind and matter, which means analytical knowledge of body and mind <I>(nāmarūpa­pariccheda ñāna)</I> has been developed.

which regards all formations as neither repugnant nor pleasurable. As this wisdom grows by continued practice of insight meditation the knowing mind gets absorbed in the annihilation of all mind, matter, and mental formations. The realisation of this knowledge is the realisation of the Noble Path and its Fruition. The moment this stage is reached, be it only for once, a meditator becomes a Stream-winner. With this, all past actions come to an end; and so no new evil actions that can drag him 
or her down to lower realms would arise.

An Arahant has no desire for the so-called happiness in the next existence after his parinibbāna. In fact, he desires neither death nor life. In that respect he is likened to a wage-earner as mentioned in the verse. A wage-earner works not because he loves his job. The only reason he works is that he is afraid to be out of a job. If he is 
jobless where can he find the means for feeding and clothing himself? So he is careful to keep himself employed, looking forward, however, to his pay-day. In the same manner an Arahant has no affection either for death or for life.

consider the five aggregates of matter, perception, sensation, mental formations, and consciousness as a heavy burden. This body has to be cared for and nurtured, clothed and fed. It has to be fed not only with food, but also with objects that appeal to its senses. It has to be constantly toned up with mindfulness of the four postures of walking, sitting, standing and lying down. It has to breathe to live. In fact, it has to be given constant attention for its welfare. To the Arahants all 
such undertakings are burdensome.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Speaking only about an Arahant’s last existence (preceding the attainment of <I>parinibbāna</I>), he or she acquires the burden of aggregates from the time rebirth-linking consciousness arose on being conceived in his or her mother’s womb. From that time onwards volitional activities begin operating, out of which mind and matter evolve without a break. 
Rebirth is produced by kamma and defilements inherited from the past. Viewed from the present existence an Arahant is just a product of the past aggregates formed as a result of previous kamma and defilements. The further one delves into the past in this manner, the more one discovers the same phenomenon of incessant arising of the aggregates. Thus one may never know when “becoming” begins. Consider which comes first, the egg or the hen; the mango seed or the mango tree. The hen lays eggs 
from which are hatched chickens which grow up to be hens; and this process goes on ad infinitum, and one never knows which is the progenitor. The same may be applied to the case of the mango tree and its seed.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Perhaps, one may be able to put forward the view that the hen and the tree are primeval, existing at the very beginning of the world, but where the aggregates of mind and matter are

course. Having no craving for a new existence, an Arahant desires cessation of his aggregates.

When a flame is observed closely, it will be seen that the combustion is continuously supported by the burning oil that is sucked up by the wick. Casual observers notice the whole 
phenomenon as one continuous process. In the same way, the aggregates, generated by action, mind, climate, and nutriment are continually renewed, now arising and now passing away. If you want to know this nature, keep note of whatever appears at your six sense-doors as you see, hear, feel or know a sense-object. You will notice that a phenomenon occurs and at once ceases just as it has occurred. When mindfulness gains strength, you will realise the instant passing away of all phenomena of 
seeing, hearing, etc. To ordinary people these phenomena are continuous. So the aggregates are likened to a flame.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the cessation of the aggregates is likened to a flame being extinguished, people who are obsessed with the idea of self usually think and say that an Arahant as an individual has disappeared. In point of fact an individual has no basis of reality. What we describe, in 
conventional language, as an individual is, after all, a compound of materiality and mentality that manifest themselves. With Arahants, these compound things become extinct. Cessation does not mean the disappearance of the individual.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If one is fixated on the belief that the individual disappears, then he will be guilty of the wrong view of annihilationism <I>(uccheda-ditthi).</I> There is, as I have said, no individual. There is only a succession of mental and physical phenomena arising and dissolving. An Arahant is an epitome of that successive phenomena of arising and dissolution. Beyond the aggregates, there is no individual. So, with Arahants, cessation means the extinction of the successive rise and fall of the aggregates. It is with this extinction in mind that Venerable Ānanda made a reference to a flame that was extinguished.</FONT>

Etymologically, it is derived from ni, a negative prefix, and va, meaning craving. It denotes the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and ignorance which are the root 
causes of suffering. The texts say:<I> “nibbāti vattadukkham ettati nibbānam.”</I> It means where the cycle of suffering ceases, there is nibbāna. At the sight of nibbāna, on the realisation of the Path and its Fruition as a result of insight meditation, defilements like craving and ignorance become extinct, thereby giving no opportunity for actions and results of actions to arise in the form of consciousness, mind and matter, six bases, contact, sensations, etc. New becoming does not occur. This is the extinction of the cycle of defilements, the cycle of action, and the cycle of results. Here, in this definition, the special quality of nibbāna is used metaphorically for the location of nibbāna, but in fact, nibbāna has no location.</FONT>

Here it emphasises that the Path and its Fruition are instrumental in bringing about the cessation of suffering. So nibbāna may also be described as the instrument by which cessation of suffering is achieved, but this is also said in a figurative sense.
<BR>The most important point to note is that the nature of nibbāna is the annihilation of all defilements.

It brings about nothing but suffering. This realism of the nature of existence is obscured by the machinations of craving; and so the truth remains clouded and not properly understood. This deviation from truth is ignorance. Sensual pleasures derived from pleasurable sights and sounds and enjoyable ideas are all suffering; but ignorance accepts them as happiness. A person under this delusion thinks to himself, “I exist. He exists. This existence is everlasting.” The sense-objects he observes appear to him as good and wholesome, appealing to his aesthetic taste. Now that he takes them as wholesome and beautiful, he craves for them; and this craving goads him on to the satisfaction of his desires for them, which, in consequence, produces attachment.

Prompted by craving, greed <I>(lobha),</I> asserts itself. Encouraged by greed, an individual makes the utmost exertion to get what is desired by every means at his or her disposal. When dissatisfied, anger arises. Unrestrained, he or she scrambles for the object of desire, playing havoc with the life and property of others. Such actions are accompanied by delusion <I>(mohā)</I> — another form of ignorance, which goes along with unwholesome deeds <I>(akusala).</I> So, when one feels angry or greedy, delusion is always there to aggravate the situation.</FONT>

As it brooks no equals, it strives after supremacy. Proud people, obsessed with wrong views, assert that they are always in the right; and with this attitude they work for the perpetuation of their wrong ideologies either by persuasion or by aggressive propaganda.

When these volitions during the performance of deeds are conjoined with greed, 
anger, and delusion, unwholesome kammas will produce bad results or demerits. Where these three main defilements are absent, wholesome kammas, or merits, are achieved. Evil deeds point the way to lower realms, while good deeds lead to the realms of men, devas and brahmas. Ordinarily, goodness brings about longevity, robust health, and material prosperity. If one wishes, one can even aspire to the Path and its Fruition, and ultimately to nibbāna, through the performance of wholesome deeds. If 
one wants to avoid being reborn in lower realms, and being troubled by bad results, one must avoid killing, stealing, etc. If one wants to be born into the realms of men, devas, and brahmas, and ultimately to tread the Path and attain nibbāna, one must practise charity, morality, and mental development.

which is conditioned by the cycle of defilements: ignorance, craving, and attachment. This cycle of actions, in turn, also brings about rebirth-linking consciousness, mind, matter, six sense-bases, contact, feeling, etc. That being so, it is pointless to do wholesome deeds. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Such a line of reasoning creates deterioration in the minds of people of low intelligence. Taken in by this kind of 
teaching, they stop doing good, practising charity, observing precepts, developing loving-kindness, and last, but not least, stop performing devotional exercises at pagodas and monasteries. It is said that they are beset by feelings of remorse for having done some good deeds such as alms-giving! For such people, all merits that they would have accumulated for the performance of good deeds will be thrown to the wind, but demerits will surely accumulate, with the inevitable result that they 
will go to hell. They will not be able to resist greed, and so they will not hesitate to think, speak, and do evil whenever they make any exertion for the satisfaction of their desires. They will also barely be able to restrain their anger, which arises on their failure to satisfy their desires. Wholesome consciousness bent on doing good, and unwholesome consciousness bent on doing evil, cannot arise simultaneously; they appear one after the other. When walking, the left foot is raised while 
the right foot stands firmly touching the ground. When the right foot is raised, the left foot stands firm. Both feet do not go up or down simultaneously. The two types of consciousness behave in the same way. While good actions are operating, bad actions remain dormant. Good deeds are invariably the result of voluntary effort, while bad deeds hardly require any special volition. They arise spontaneously obeying the dictates of greed, anger, and the like. Even when one is practising Dhamma to 
suppress them, they appear at the slightest opportunity. It is thus inevitable that when one abandons wholesome deeds, unwholesomeness is sure to gain in abundance. The way to the lower realms is wide open for an evil-doer. All things considered, it is because of the wrong views entertained by his mentor that the pupil goes astray.

So the cycle of actions brings about the cycle of results <I>(vipāka vatta).</I> To escape from this cycle, one should practise charity morality, and mental development, especially mental culture through insight meditation, which will ultimately lead one to the Path of Arahantship. Then rebirth ceases giving no opportunity for the arising of new “becoming,” or new mind and matter. Thus the cycle of results may be defined as the recurrence of aggregates or conditioned things, as a result of actions, moral or immoral.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Pāli word <I>“vatta”</I> simply means going round in circles. The cycle of defilements resolves into the cycle of actions, which, in its turn, resolves into the cycle of results, and in this way they revolve in a circle that has no beginning or end. No one can stop this wheel. Regarding the nature of actions and their results, it may be easy for an individual to desist from doing good, but he will be utterly unable to resist evil. If you fail to accomplish moral actions, you can be sure that immoral actions will get the better of you. Kamma results produced by meritorious deeds will be highly beneficial to you, for they can send you to the abode of human beings and devas, but demerits accumulated by evil actions forced upon you by defilements will surely drag you down to hell. If your kamma is favourable, you may have the opportunity to associate with men of wisdom and virtue, but if bad kamma is at work, you will become a co-traveller with evil companions, and you may continue to commit evil deeds throughout your life. In one’s life, one may have done millions of things, but at death there is only one action that produces rebirth, rendering remaining actions ineffective as one departs from this world.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, these residual kammas are retributive, and once one goes down to the lower realms, one would suffer there for aeons.

One may weep and wail for such sufferings. If one is reborn as an animal, a worm, an insect, a buffalo, a bullock, a horse, or an elephant, one will face untold miseries, for in the animal world, the strong victimize the weak who, in the end, would become a meal for the former.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Even when favourable kammas are at work and one is reborn a man, one cannot escape old age, disease, and death, which cause grief, lamentation, etc., which are all suffering. If one is unfortunate, one may live in poverty in one’s new existence, or one may be victimized by the strong, or one may be tempted to commit evil. Then, as a result of such evil actions, one may again go down to lower 
realms when one dies. If luck would have it, one may be reborn in heaven, but in heaven too, one may become sad, instead of being glad, as one feels that one’s desires are not totally fulfilled. Even as a deva, one may become dejected with thoughts of death. If, even as a deva, one forgets the Dhamma in the pursuit of sensual pleasures, one may also go down to lower realms on one’s decease from the world of devas.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

This practice entails the development of morality, concentration, and wisdom, which are the main objectives of mental culture that I spoke of earlier in this discourse when I emphasised insight meditation. The meditators of this Sāsana Yeikthā are 
familiar with Satipatthāna Vipassanā, which prescribes methods of noting the arising and dissolution of mind and matter as well as sense-bases, contact, feeling, etc., which are conditioned by the cycle of results in the present existence.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Escape"></A>How to Escape from the Three Cycles</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Let me elaborate on this practice of insight meditation. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking are the function of the six groups of consciousness, namely, eye, ear, nose, tongue, touch, and mind consciousness. Consciousness is invariably accompanied by its concomitants, which fall into the category of mentality. The seat of the sense-organs, the body, is, of course, materiality. When the eye, the object and the 
sense-base meet, contact occurs, and feeling arises. These five in the cycle of resultants — mentality, materiality, sense-base, contact, and feeling — belong to the present moment, since they are taking place daily. If they are not contemplated with insight knowledge, craving develops in accordance with the kind of feelings created, whether pleasant or unpleasant. Craving begets attachment. Not being able to note the five resultants as they really are is ignorance, which, together with 
craving and attachment, constitutes the cycle of defilements. This gives birth to the cycle of actions, which in its turn produces the cycle of results. To prevent the first cycle, that of defilements, from arising, the workings of the cycle of results must be observed and noted with the three characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self, when knowledge of the absolute reality of conditioned things will dispel all defilements. In the absence of ignorance, craving cannot 
arise; and in the absence of craving, attachment withers away. Then the cycle of actions ceases to operate, being unable to bring about results. In this manner all the three cycles subside.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Here I would like to quote the following extract from the Loka Sutta of the Nidānavagga Samyutta (S.ii.73):</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Katamo ca,

you exert for the fulfilment of desires by all means. Then actions produce rebirths that bring the miseries of old age and death. This applies with due alteration of details to other sense-bases.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Suppose you were made to enjoy the pleasures of the sights of men and women, handsome and pretty, or beautiful paintings without a break for a space of one minute or one second, for one month or one year. Can you bear it? Suppose you are asked to listen to good music all day long, or all month, or all year round. Could you do it? If you are consuming delicacies, can you continue to enjoy them day 
in and day out? Can you enjoy pleasurable contacts indefinitely? If such pleasures were to be enjoyed without any rest or sleep, you will surely get bored in the end. Is not sleep a moment of peace that brings true happiness without the interference of sense-objects?</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One who is familiar with only sensual pleasures thinks highly of them. Enjoyment is the highest goal. In the Buddha’s time a 
doctrine was current among heretics to the effect that suffering could be exterminated during the present state of existence without the extinction of existence. Followers of that doctrine were known as <I>ditthadhammavādī.</I> They used to teach: “Enjoy all kinds of sensual pleasures wherever available. This is the ultimate good.” This is mentioned in Brahmajāla Sutta. Those who know only jhānic or Brahmanic bliss to the exclusion of other kinds of happiness, praise it to the skies. In fact, Baka Brahma told the Buddha that Brahmanic bliss was the most enjoyable.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One would like to think that the kind of food and drink obtainable in cities and towns appear to be more delicious than that available in villages. In the same way people would like to think that jhānic bliss is better than sensual pleasures. In fact, the kind of bliss attained through the Path and its Fruition is better than <I>jhānic</I> bliss. Going a step further, the bliss of nibbāna is better than the bliss of the Path and its Fruition. </FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">First <I>jhānic</I> bliss is better than happiness derived from sensual pleasures. Regarding jhānic bliss, Venerable Sāriputta commented as follows, first pointing out the nature of sensual pleasures: a visible object gives rise to eye-consciousness, an audible object to ear-consciousness, an olfactory-object to nose-consciousness, a taste-object to tongue-consciousness and a tangible object to touch-consciousness. All these objects of the senses appeal to the mind, generate sense of love or affection, produce sensuality and incite lust. They all go to make the five constituents of sensual pleasures. In the world of the senses those who has the opportunity to enjoy these five constituents feel that they have attained happiness.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On the practice of the first <I>jhāna,</I> sensual pleasures are abandoned. One who gains <I>jhāna</I> gets absorbed in the <I>jhāna</I> factors of initial application <I>(vitakka),</I> sustained application <I>(vicāra)</I>, joy <I>(pīti</I>), happiness <I>(sukha),</I> and one-pointedness <I>(ekaggatā).</I> The course of the first jhānic rapture and happiness flows continuously without interruption, unlike the earthly joys of the senses that arise by fits and starts. In the sensual world one may feel happy at one moment and sad at another, but the thrill of <I>jhānic</I> bliss continues without interruption for some length of time. If, during the period of concentrating on jhānic bliss, a meditator happens to recall sensual pleasures enjoyed previously, he or she will be remorseful, suffering mental pain which may be likened to the pain of an old wound receiving a fresh blow. It means that to a meditator absorbed in <I>jhāna,</I> the very memory of the pleasures of the senses is enough to generate abhorrence and fear. He or she looks forward to the attainment of nibbāna where no feeling arises.</FONT>

If, by chance, the first <I>jhāna</I> consciousness arises during initial and sustained application, the meditator concentrating on second <I>jhāna</I> would feel painful at the thought of that consciousness as much as one feels painful when a fresh blow is given to an old wound. These remarks apply also to those achieving the third and fourth <I>jhānas</I> recalling lesser jhānas during their concentration.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If may be shown here that happiness derived from the first <I>jhāna</I> far transcends that derived from sensual pleasures, that derived from the second <I>jhāna</I> far transcends that derived from the first, that derived from the third far transcends that derived from the second, and that derived from the fourth far transcends that derived from the third. Compared to such <I>jhānic</I> happiness, the joy of formless <I>jhāna </I>is far superior to that enjoyed in the other four ordinary <I>jhāna</I> states. The four formless <I>jhān</I>as 
are: absorption in the infinity of space <I>(ākāsanañcāyatana),</I> absorption in the infinity of consciousness <I>(viññānañcāyatana),</I> absorption in nothingness <I>(ākiñcaññnāyatana),</I> and absorption in neither-perception-nor-non-perception <I>(nevāsaññā-nāsaññāyatana).</I> Each <I>jhāna</I> is better than the other, but even in the highest formless <I>jhāna,</I> namely absorption in neither-perception-nor-non-perception, extremely subtle sensations can arise.

As knowledge of equanimity about formations <I>(sankhārupekkhā ñāna)</I> develops, the meditator becomes aware of a state that is beyond the phenomena of arising and passing away. It means that it has gone beyond formations to come nearer to nibbāna. Mental formations are diametrically opposed to nibbāna, and the two are incompatible. If one exists, the other disappears. Where there is no arising, there is nibbāna; and conversely where there is arising, there is no nibbāna. One can see no light in the darkness, and no darkness in the light.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With sentient beings, mind and matter renew their states at the time of conception. It happens in this way, Immediately after rebirth-consciousness, passive or life-continuum consciousness <I>(bhavanga</I>) arises. It is from this moment of arising that material phenomena arising from the mind spring up. This process continues, and mind and matter come into being in succession in accordance with 
the types of consciousness appropriate to the objects perceived. For instance, mind-consciousness occurs when one thinks of an object, and touch consciousness when one touches it; and through such consciousness is conditioned mentality-materiality or psycho-physical phenomena <I>(nāmarūpa)</I>. This “becoming” flows throughout life, after birth has taken place. When this life has run its course, it is renewed in the next existence and this goes on ad infinitum. In other words, 
formations influenced jointly by wholesome or unwholesome types of consciousness <I>(kamma),</I> mind <I>(citta)</I>, climate <I>(utu),</I> and nutriment <I>(āhāra),</I> are called <I>“sankhārā,”</I> which can be perceived by insight knowledge.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After repeated meditation exercises, a meditator will experience that consciousness flows on without prompting like a stream into the region

When an object of mind or an object of sense enters this stream, other types of consciousness, such as mind-consciousness or 
touch-consciousness occur, as stated before, appropriate to the objects perceived. Conditioned things are formed in this way and life-continuum goes on like a running stream. That being so, ordinary people think that the continuous mass of mind and matter exists without suffering any change. They think that their bodies that they see 
 at the present moment are the same as that existed when they were young. From such notions arises attachment to self and to the idea of permanence of self. Owing to this attachment realities are not appreciated. When they experience the onset of pleasurable sensations assailing their minds, they mistake them for happiness. Not being able to grasp the ultimate truths about mind and matter, they are led to believe in permanence, happiness, and self.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Through insight the meditator knows the process of formation and dissolution of conditioned things, so his or her conviction about impermanence stands firm. The meditator also realises that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory, and what is unsatisfactory is suffering. The meditator sees no “I” in any phenomenon. As the meditator notes the arising and passing away of mind and matter, he or she perceives that this cycle of 
formation and dissolution is endless. What the meditator thus sees with the aid of insight meditation is occurrence. Concentrating on it incessantly, the meditator arrives at knowledge of equanimity about formations <I>(sankhārūpekkhā ñāna),</I> when the mind is inclined to the element of peace where the stream of mind and matter ceases to flow. As nothing occurs at this stage, it is called non-occurrence. That moment when this knowledge matures through the consciousness of the Path and its Fruition is the moment of truth when the meditator becomes at one with nibbāna.</FONT>

In other words, nibbāna is signless. Those not experienced in insight meditation believe that visible objects have definite shapes or dimensions. Even the meditator thinks so at the beginning of the practice. In accordance with the principles of Satipatthāna, the meditator may be noting “walking” when walking, but cannot shake off the awareness that, in the process of walking, his or her leg is being lifted and that his or her body is moving. He or she feels the sensation of movement of his or her body. Similarly when noting the rising and falling of the abdomen, the meditator is always conscious of the shape and form of the abdomen.

mindfulness only extends to the cessation of phenomena. It happens in this way: each thought-moment of consciousness has three instants — arising or genesis <I>(uppādi)</I> as the beginning, stasis or development <I>(thiti)</I> as the middle, and cessation or dissolution <I>(bhanga</I>) as the end of the phenomenon.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Before the practice of insight meditation, the meditator is not conscious 
of these three instants of thought-moments. To the beginner, all forms, concepts, and signs indicate that every phenomenon occurs as a continuous chain of events. The meditator thinks that events flow like a stream without a break. When the first stage of insight, starts to develop, namely, analytical knowledge of body and mind <I>(nāmarūpa pariccheda ñāna),</I> which is knowledge arrived at by dissecting mind and body into their ultimate parts, notions of continuity dwindle to a certain extent. When knowledge by comprehension <I>(sammasana ñāna)</I> is developed, the meditator gains the knowledge of the arising and ceasing of past, present, and future events as arising, development, and dissolution. Even then they seem durable since they are concatenated. When the knowledge of arising and passing away <I>(udayabbaya ñāna)</I> is realised, the meditator is aware of the beginning and end of the thought-moment, but the actual occurrence, the middle state, is not apparent. </FONT>

He or she is just able to recognise mental formations with the three characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self. It 
is only when the knowledge of equanimity about formations arises, that the meditator is able to cultivate indifference to all signs that indicate formations, namely, arising, development, and cessation. Finally, when the meditator reflects with knowledge of reviewing <I>(paccavekkhanā ñāna),</I> on the Path and its Fruition, passions already destroyed, passions to be further destroyed, and nibbāna, then he or she arrives at the ultimate stage where all signs of mental formations disappear.</FONT>

I repeat the words of Milinda Pañhā when I say that nibbāna is formless. A meditator concentrating on it with the knowledges of equanimity, adaptation, and 
maturity (gotrabhū ñāṇa) with nibbāna as its object, will get lost in the stream of consciousness that acknowledges the cessation of all formations.

The grammatical connotation of <I>“āyūhanā”</I> is “constructing or assembling.” As in constructing a house, where the builder assembles materials in an appropriate order, efforts to accumulate actions constitute mental formations. Where such efforts are absent, there you will find nibbāna.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the function of mental formations is to accumulate, its characteristic is formation, which may be either passive or active. Where formation is conditioned by the four composite factors of the so-called being, namely, kamma, mind, climate, and nutriment, it is passive. Mind and matter are subject to these four factors. It is with reference to this mind and matter that we say all formations are 
impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. Cetasikā is the concomitants of consciousness, and it is also called the aggregate of mental formations. When it operates to cause mental, verbal, or physical conduct, the characteristic of formations is said to be active. Volition <I>(cetanā)</I> is one of the mental concomitants. It produces results, either good or bad, in conformity with the mental, verbal, and physical actions performed meritoriously or demeritoriously. Wholesome or unwholesome kammas arise in this way, and it is this kamma that is active formations that cause the renewal of existence after the old aggregates have passed away.

Freed from the influence of defilements, past kammas are rendered impotent, and they are utterly unable to bring about the formation of a new existence. With Arahants, all aggregates cease 
together with all passions; and this state is known as anupādisesa nibbāna.</FONT></P><H5 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Kamma Does Not Cease Without Exertion</FONT></B></H5><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It has been suggested that non-accumulation is the opposite of exerting to accumulate actions that bring about kamma formations. If this is not seen 
in its proper light, it may be misinterpreted that one should make no effort to accumulate actions. What is meant here is that in the absence of defilements, actions cannot accumulate, and meritorious deeds thus appear to be superfluous with reference to Arahants. You should not run away with the idea that if you do nothing, there will be no kammic force, and thus no result. That may be possible, but it is impracticable. Certain teachers misinterpret the text and say, “All efforts lead to 
suffering. Making no effort is cessation, and is, therefore, nibbāna. Almsgiving, practising morality, and mental development are superfluous. Keep the mind inert. This leads to nibbāna.” In 1952, when I came to Rangoon, I heard such teachings over the radio. They might please those who have no inclination to exert in the practice of the Dhamma. Such teachings are contrary to what the Buddha taught. In the Tipitaka it says that all evil should be shunned and that charity, morality, and 
mental development must be practised. Nowhere has it been said that wholesome deeds should not be done! Without the accumulation of wholesome deeds, bad kamma can never be avoided.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The flesh is prone to evil, doing good needs faith, willingness, and effort. It is difficult to achieve. To accomplish it is like going against the tide. Evil, however, can be easily done, for to commit it no 
special effort is necessary. It occurs naturally. Thus we say that an evil-doer drifts with the tide.<BR>When law and prudence intervene, evil actions, are checked to a certain extent. For ordinary ordinary people, there are only two things to choose — to do wholesome kamma, or to do unwholesome kamma. For as long as good deeds remain undone, evil will predominate. If, for every hundred minutes, ninety minutes are devoted to the execution of evil by unwholesome consciousness, there will be 
only ten minutes left for wholesome consciousness to perform its function. If these ten minutes of are abandoned, evil will get the better of you for the full one hundred minutes.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A person who does not practise mental discipline has no way of knowing how to restrain evil.

A single man, without the ties of marriage, will also be unable to resist the temptation of pleasurable sense-objects. Since he has all the 
privileges of enjoying what is there to be enjoyed, he would not care to control his passions of greed, anger, and ignorance. He is sure to vent his anger if he encounters any objects that he regards as undesirable. There is a story of an uncle and a nephew regarding mind-control. The young man used to say, “Leave the mind alone, by giving it free rein, it can keep out defilements of its own accord.” The uncle got fed up with his wisecracks and gave his nephew a slap on the cheek. When 
asked why, the uncle explained that he was testing the truth of the statement made. The young man, needless to say, became very angry. Anger can be discarded only when Arahantship is attained through the practice of insight meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the Buddha’s time, Venerable Sāriputta was known for his equanimity.

An Arahant possesses equanimity through the extermination or all passions like anger, etc., with the practice of insight meditation which brings forth Path-consciousness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When you see disgusting things can you control your mind so

Where wholesome kamma is not practised, unwholesome kamma prevails. If one practises charity, morality, and mental development, one can be reborn in the fortunate realms of men or 
devas, even though one may not have aspired to the Path and its Fruition. In the latter predicament of not having been able to realise the Path, if one practises mental development wherever one is reborn, one can in the end find the path. However, if one neglects doing good deeds, unable to accumulates merit, one’s bad actions will lead to results appropriate to what one has done, and one will suffer for them. One may even go to lower realms. Hence instructions not to practise good must be 
viewed with dread. That is why I always urge everyone to do meritorious deeds. Let me repeat here that non-accumulation does not mean to shun meritorious deeds. It only means that is abandons wholesome or unwholesome kamma that gives rise to rebirth-consciousness. Good deeds help to develop knowledge of dissolving things as fearful, knowledge of fearful things as baneful, and knowledge of baneful things as disgusting.</FONT></P><H5 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

That is obvious. Questions may arise, however, whether they accumulate merits by their practice of charity, morality, concentration, insight meditation, loving-kindness, paying 
homage to the Buddha, and so forth. Since defilements are absent, such good deeds produce no results. You may recall that in the namakāra devotional verse, the Buddha is described as having renounced both wholesome and unwholesome kammas for he has eliminated the cycles of defilement and action. Arahants can also eliminate them. However, unlike the Buddha they cannot do away with impressions (vāsanā) of the past good or bad actions that remain on the mind. Here, in the devotional verse, 
renunciation of wholesome kammas means that actions are rendered ineffective because defilements have been exterminated by means of Path-consciousness. For ordinary people, moral or immoral actions, both past and present, produce results in the form of rebirth-linking. In this way sentient beings pass through innumerable existence. For as long as aggregates continue to arise, suffering is endless.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

Rebirth-linking and Absence of Rebirth-linking</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Of this rebirth-linking, the Patisambhidāmagga has this to say: <I>“Patisandhi sankhārā; appatisandhi nibbānam.”</I> It means rebirth-linking is formations; absence of rebirth-linking is nibbāna. Rebirth-linking is so called because it links across the gap separating the end of the former existence from the beginning of the next existence. Past existence becomes linked with the present ad infinitum for as long as the law of kamma is working. This linking brings about life in lower realms, in the hungry ghost realm, in the animal realm, or, for that matter in other realms as well. To be born again and again in the abodes of suffering just mentioned is terrible. Unless one gains Arahantship, one will be lost in the cycle of existence. Even Stream-winners will have to go for seven rounds in the sphere of the senses. A Once-returner has two existences to go. A Non-returner will be in the Pure Abodes where he is destined to attain Arahantship. Others will remain in the realm of defilements that paves the way to endless rebirths. As I have said, for Arahants all the three cycles of action, defilement, and result cease. This is the absence of rebirth-linking <I>(appatisandhi)</I> — a characteristic of nibbāna. Thus it may be said that nibbāna is unborn.</FONT>

The Burden of Actions</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Accumulation of actions, moral or immoral, performed by an individual, is ābhisankhāra, which is another name for kamma formations. It is also a heavy burden. When actions performed are evil, they lead the evil-doer to realms of suffering like hell. When an 
individual is reborn in happy conditions, as in heaven, as a result of moral actions, he will still be troubled with old age, disease, and death. Whether he is satisfied with his kamma-results or not, he cannot get away from these three undesirable conditions. So he carries his burden of actions, willy-nilly, unable to avoid the cycle of suffering. Even when he is reborn a man, he may be so reborn in wretched poverty, afflicted with disease, and troubled with ill-health. Even though he may 
have good kamma-results awaiting him, he may not have the opportunity to enjoy these results if bad kamma overtakes him afterwards. He will, as usual, be forced to endure misery. In real life, it may be possible for him to avoid punishment for his crimes. If he has a good lawyer to plead for him, he may come out of the case an innocent man. In extenuating circumstances, he may bribe for his freedom. Then, there is amnesty to save him. However, with kamma there is no escape from the law of 
retribution. It may lie dormant for aeons in the cycles of existence, but when it an opportunity occurs for it to bear fruit, it will make its presence felt. The burden of actions and results is thus very heavy!</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There is only one way to abandon the burden of actions, and that is to practise insight meditation. If one attains the stage of Stream-winning, all unprofitable actions cease, and 
one can never go down to the lower realms. If one attains Arahantship, all burdens will be lifted from one’s shoulders, and no new “becoming” will arise, but before an Arahant attains parinibbāna, the past kammas can give their effects. It is said that even Buddhas cannot evade the results of kamma, which are inherited, as it were, from former existences.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">3. The Burden of the Aggregates</FONT>
</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Because of the burden of actions, the burden of aggregates has to be carried from one existence to the next. New aggregates arise as a consequence of the past old aggregates. They are very active, constantly moving about walking, sitting, standing, or lying down. They have to be fed, cleansed, and clothed. They like pleasure, and so they have to be appeased with objects that give them pleasurable 
sensations. In an attempt to fulfil their desires, they are compelled to do things that are sinful. When a crime is committed, it affects only the environment that surrounds the criminal, and that is the end of it. However, when an immoral act is committed, it worries the sinner throughout the endless cycles of existence. To escape from them he will have to accumulate good actions with the development of good perception, good formation, and good consciousness. When one gets old, one feels the 
heavy burden. He learns that it has to be carried not for one brief moment, but for one’s entire life, and throughout samsāra, without any respite, without any limit of weight, distance, or time. I have told you elsewhere about the cycles of defilement, actions, and results. In essence, these three cycles have a bearing on the three burdens that I am talking about.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To sum up, all 
defilements like greed, anger, and ignorance constitute the burden of defilements, all moral or immoral actions constitute the burden of actions, and the five aggregates constitute the burden of aggregates.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Discarding"></A>Discarding All Burdens</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Since Arahants have

That is past kammas can no longer create new “becoming” for them. However, during their lifetime, they continue to give results. The Commentaries say that the Buddha was affluent in his day because of his past good kammas. However, he was accused of being immoral by Sundarī, the female 
ascetic, because his past kamma was giving its results at that time. Venerable Sīvalī always received bountiful alms, because he was generous in giving alms in his previous existences.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Arahants are often described as holy men with no burden on their shoulders. Their accomplishment is the realisation of the fruits of the Path. With them the fetter of existence has been severed. In modern parlance we use the expression: breaking the chains. However, with Arahants it is more than breaking the chains of human bondage. The bondage of human passion that ties man to the endless cycle of existence, is entirely cut off by 
an Arahant. Freed from this chain of existence, it is no longer necessary for them to be born anew. A man negligent of the Dhamma fails to break the chain of existence, which could, at one time or another, drag him down to the four lower realms if his kamma is bad. Hence the Dhammapada says, “A worldling negligent of the Dhamma makes four lower realms his permanent residence.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Men live 
in their own houses. If circumstances compel them to visit other people’s houses, they might stay there for a while as guests and return to their own houses. In the same way, when their permanent address is hell, they might, once in a while, pay a visit to higher planes of existence to come back to their rightful place. Sometimes, people born unto this world as men or women go up to the brahma realms by virtue of their wholesome kammas, but the fetter of sensual existence drags them down to 
the human abode. So they die as brahmas to be reborn as men or women in this world.<BR>When a tether is short the bullock cannot roam about beyond what the tether allows. In the same way a man tethered by a fetter to the narrow confines of existence cannot go beyond those confines. When his fetter of existence allows him to roam about only in the form sphere or formless sphere, he will never be able to go beyond the limits to approach nibbāna. Hence he continues to live in misery, suffering, 
old age, ill-health, and death.

(In ordinary people biases rise 
to the surface as defilements as soon as an opportunity occurs). Like all sentient beings, Arahants possess sense faculties because the sense-bases exist in their physical bodies. As these sense-bases remain unimpaired, they can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch the sense-objects and differentiate which among them is good or bad. In matters of the five sense faculties, they are like ordinary human beings because they cannot as yet do away with feeling. They know what suffering and happiness 
are like, but, since they have discarded all defilements such as anger, they do not feel unhappy, although, of course, they may recognise physical discomfort as such. Conditioned by seasonal changes, they may feel hot or cold. They may feel fit or unfit according to their health. When objects of sense are not pleasing they may feel awkward physically, but mentally they are indifferent. They have virtually no interest in pleasure or pain. No greed, anger, nor ignorance arise in them on account 
of the pleasurable sensations created by sense-objects.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Cessation of Lust</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the Arahant, lust <I>(rāga)</I> has ceased arising and so have anger and ignorance.

However, the body — the aggregates — still remains, and this may be for one or two thousand cycles in the case of those who realised the Path while in the plane of the brahmas. This is good in a way, because in that world physical suffering and unpleasant objects are non-existent. However, for those who realise the Path in this human world, they will have to endure the ills to which the flesh is an heir. For instance, the drudgery of making daily rounds for food, washing the face or taking a bath daily, etc. In this way an Arahant has to carry the burden of the aggregates in spite of having no attachment to them.</FONT>

That means that he carried the burden of his aggregates for a hundred and sixty years, becoming liberated from the shackles of the aggregates as well as human passions only after parinibbāna.

It says it is the attainment by a noble bhikkhu who is worthy of respect and homage earned by virtue of his abandonment of biases and defilements, having practised all there is to be practised, having accomplished all there is to be accomplished, having laid down the burden of aggregates, having cut off the fetter of existence, having been emancipated though knowledge fully-acquired, having rejected feeling as not delightful, and finally, having gained peace and tranquility during his life-time.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The important point to note here is that feeling ceases with the parinibbāna of the Arahant. For ordinary people, and even for trained meditators, it cannot be discarded. They are wont to accept it as delightful, and thus attachment to it arises in them. Being attached to feeling, they take it on even at the moment of decease-consciousness. It thus flows on as the arising of rebirth-linking 
consciousness. Consequently new becoming arises. However, for the Arahant the cessation of feeling has been initiated in his life-time. It may be remembered that an analogy has been drawn from the dying out of a flame with regard to that cessation. This dying out started in his life-time. Since feeling has thus been quenched, there is no opportunity for becoming to arise again after the Arahant’s parinibbāna.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In my last discourse, anupādisesa nibbāna was shown as an abode where the element of peace resides. This is said figuratively, for it has no location. Neither is it a cause nor an effect. In the Commentaries, <I>sa-upādisesa nibbāna</I> is shown as the destruction and absence of lust, without indicating any location, cause, or effect. It will not be strictly correct to say that the Path and its Fruition inclining towards nibbāna is the cause, and the cessation of defilements in the two elements is the effect. It may also be noted that Peace to which the Path and its Fruition are inclined is ordinary nibbāna and the two elements now under review are extraordinary nibbāna.

arose, or it is arising, or it will arise. It has no relationship to time. Strictly speaking, we do not say that cessation has completed. It occurs with the moment that Path-consciousness occurs. When defilements cease, the aggregates dependent on them, lose the opportunity to arise. The phenomenon in this instance is timeless.

He was successful in all his previous ventures, but on the last occasion, his ship was wrecked. All the other sailors and men were drowned and he alone saved himself. He was washed to 
the shores of Suppāraka. Having been tossed about in the sea, he lost all his clothes. When he got to the dry land, he made for himself a girdle of leaves stitched together with small sticks. He took a begging bowl from a shrine, and with it he went round the village for alms-food. By the girdle he wore, the residents of the place mistook him for an Arahant and offered him food and clothing. Bāhiya thought to himself that if he donned the clothes offered him, public esteem towards him as an 
Arahant would be shattered. So he stuck to his girdle for a dress. The people continued to revere him as an Arahant, and, as such, his fame spread far and wide.

I was the eldest of the seven, and am now reborn in the world of brahmas. Formerly, your faith in the Dhamma was so strong that when offered food by an Arahant you refused it lest it would hamper your realisation of the Dhamma. Now you have become an imposter, well-pleased with 
what little affluence you have achieved through deception. You are no Arahant, possessing no moral qualities that belong to an Arahant.” </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On hearing this, Bāhiya was greatly ashamed and requested the brahma to guide him to the presence of an Arahant, if there were one.

He or 
she does not just see it. He or she goes further, and lets the mind dwell on things incidental to the act of seeing, for instance, on the shape and form of the thing seen, considering whether it is desirable or repugnant, and reacting with feelings of pain or pleasure according to the nature of the object. Naturally, he or she is pleased when it gives pleasure, but when seeing what is considers to be ugly, he or she becomes not only disconcerted, but also disgusted and angry. Even when he or 
she is indifferent to it, the fact remains that ego has arisen. “I see it,” he or she thinks; and that “I” appears permanent. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If one just sees it and notes that one has seen it, without ruminating on the nature of the subject that sees it, the object that is seen, and the incidents of seeing, that would be merely just seeing. However, to see a thing and stop at seeing it is not easy 
to do. If one fails to recognise only the act of seeing for the sake of seeing, one cannot help taking cognizance of the individual or the thing seen, thinking whether he, she, or it is agreeable or not. If one likes what one sees, affection will grow, and if it is disagreeable, ill-will will gnaw at the heart. Even if one is indifferent to whomever one sees, one will already have cultivated the idea of individuality and permanence of that individual. One will find it difficult to break away 
from this notion of ego. It is only through the practice of insight meditation that one will rightly know how to see only what one sees and nothing more.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Without practising insight meditation, it will not be possible for a lay person to stop short at hearing when hearing, at smelling when smelling, at tasting when tasting, and at touching when touching. The most difficult thing to achieve is 
to stop at thinking as one thinks, so it is advised that one notes continually the phenomena as they occur. In the beginning it is almost impossible to note all the phenomena of seeing, hearing etc., so begin with one particular phenomenon as you practise meditation. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the teaching of Satipatthāna, it says that one should note walking as one walks. This is watching the phenomenon of 
movement, the working of the element of motion. When you stand up, note that you are standing up; when you sit down, note that you are sitting down. During such moments you may experience some tangible things happening in your body. Note them. We recommend that you to watch the rising and falling of the abdomen as you take up meditation. As you are observing the rising and falling of the abdomen in conformity with the method of meditation practice, your mind may wander, and you will start 
thinking this and that. Note what you are thinking about. At times, as you meditate, you may feel tired, hot, stuffy, or painful. Note these sensations too. As you feel tired, you may improve your posture. Note every movement that you make as you seek comfort. As you are meditating you may hear extraneous sounds, which must also be noted as they arise. In brief, you must note your own behaviour, both physical and mental, together with sensations that you feel. When there is nothing in 
particular to note, concentrate your mind on your abdomen as in the beginning.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As concentration develops you will find that when you see, seeing is established momentarily just to dissolve in the next moment. The same can be said of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking. As you note the act of hearing, both the sound and the perception of the sound disappear. When you feel pain, 
both the affliction causing pain and the painful feeling disappear. You concentrate on seeing, noting inwardly what you know as seeing.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Subsequently, seeing, noting, and knowing get dissolved. Then knowledge will arise that what arises passes away, and thus that the phenomenon of seeing is impermanent. This knowledge of the transitory nature of things is knowledge of impermanence <I>(aniccānupassanā ñāna)</I>. 
What arises only to get dissolved is not satisfactory; so this phenomenon is, after all, suffering. This knowledge of the realisation of the truth relating to suffering is <I>dukkhānupassanā ñāna.</I> Furthermore, knowledge of the realisation of the not-self nature of things <I>(anattānupassanā ñāna),</I> is also developed as you get convinced that it is in the nature of things just to happen of their own accord.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

He did not, as he watched the phenomenon, think to himself, “I see it. This is my self who is seeing it.” As his mind got freed from attachment, egoistic pride, and wrong views, together with the notion of self, were dispelled.</FONT>

There are six pairs of faculties, sense bases, consisting of six sense-organs, namely, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, grouped as internal, and six sense-objects, namely, form, sound, odour, taste, contact and ideas, grouped as external. When one gets detached from such defilements as attachment and the like through 
the development of insight knowledge, one also gets detached from both the internal (subjective) and external (objective) sense-bases. You or your “self” no longer abide in the mind-door, sense-object and consciousness. This cessation of the functions of these sense-bases is nibbāna itself.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This agrees with the actual experience of the meditator. In the early stages of the practice, the 
meditator has to bend the mind on the mind door, sense-object, and consciousness to note the arising and passing away of mind and matter. All the time he or she is aware of the rise and fall of aggregates. When insight knowledge matures, the mind flows, as it were, into the cessation of all phenomena of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and knowing, when the meditator is said to come face to face with nibbāna.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

When the Enlightened One resumed his alms-round, Bāhiya went in search of clothing discarded by others so that they could be made into a monk’s robe, for he intended to get ordained. Unfortunately, a cow protecting her 
calves attacked him. He died on the spot. When the Buddha returned to his monastery, he found the body of the Arahant, Bāhiya. He arranged for it to be cremated in a fitting manner and told his disciples to erect a pagoda <I>(cetiya)</I> in his memory.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The monks at the monastery asked the Buddha where Bāhiya was reborn.

that he had thus attained parinibbāna, uttering the verse cited earlier with reference to nibbāna where four primary elements are non-existent.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Commentaries say that Bāhiya died as he was gored by a cow who was a woman in one of its previous existences. He wronged the woman, robbing and raping her; and she died swearing vengeance on him. She was reborn an ogress many times, and he, as 
a man to be killed by her. Thus he died many deaths at the hands of the ogress. His unwholesome deeds followed him like a shadow, causing untold miseries, often in the lower realms. It was all as a result of his bad kamma. Had he not attained Arahantship after meeting the Buddha, he would have continued to suffer from his evil deeds. However, now, although his death was caused by a cow in the way described, all suffering ceased for him on his attainment of nibbāna where no aggregates arise. 
The Buddha thus regarded his death as a triumph. He honoured Bāhiya as pre-eminent among his disciples in the matter of gaining higher knowledge in the shortest possible time.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Visual"></A>The Eye and Visual Perception</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the Kāmaguna Sutta of the Salāyatana Samyutta it says:</FONT>

This is how nibbāna is realised through meditating on the phenomenon of seeing. When a meditator is mindful of the rising and falling of the abdomen, or the physical postures of sitting or standing, or the phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., during 
meditation, he or she will become aware of the process of dissolution. If so, knowledge of dissolution develops. From the point of view of the subject who sees, there is absolutely nothing about which to say, “It is I,” or “I exist.” From the point of view of the object that is seen, there is nothing to show, “It is a thing, it is an individual.” Thus one cannot find anything worthy of attachment. As this fact is being contemplated, the meditator attains the knowledge of 
equanimity about formations, through bare awareness of the states of the mind, body, and of mental formations. Eventually the meditator will become aware of the cessation of all aggregates.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When this stage is reached, one might even feel that all matter in the body has disappeared. That is why it is said:<I> “Cakkhu ca nirujjhati,”</I> which means that the organ of seeing ceases (to function). On meditating further, you will notice that the form, the mind, and the perception, all relating to the phenomenon of seeing, have been swept away to non-entity. The relevant phrase is “rūpasaññā ca nirujjhati,” meaning that the visual perception of form ceases (to arise). This all denotes cessation of the sense-base and the sense-object.

If they truly realise what suffering is, they are bound to get disgusted with it and will certainly try to escape it. They assert that they know suffering, but they do not actually regard mind and

He or she must be truly convinced of the reality of human suffering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It is only when a meditator gains insight into the true nature of mind and matter that he or she regards them as repugnant and considers all attachment as vain and empty. Eventually, he or she develops indifference to the rise 
and fall of aggregates to arrive at the stage where all formations can be regarded with equanimity. At first, one has to exert to come to this stage, but with continued practice, equanimity arises naturally as one contemplates the rise and fall of phenomena. When you have acquired that knowledge, you feel that you become cognisant of phenomena at once, but are unaffected by them, whether they are agreeable or not. No attachment arises in your mind when it dwells on pleasurable objects, nor 
are you disconcerted by disagreeable things. You have developed stoicism like that of Arahants. At this stage of mental development, there may be occasions when your mind would like to roam about leaving the object of concentration behind, but as you gain experience, your mind would refuse to leave the object on which it dwells.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With this right method of meditation, you proceed from 
knowledge of equanimity about formations to knowledge of adaptation <I>(anuloma ñāna),</I> when you gain adaptive knowledge in preparation for realising the Four Noble Truths.

However, nibbāna is absolute reality, the reality of the nullification of the activities of mind, 
matter, and mental formations to which the knowledge of the Path, Fruition, and reviewing <I>(paccavekkhana)</I> is inclined. It is the mind-object to which this knowledge is directed. Buddhas, Arahants, and Noble Ones vouch for the truth of its reality. For the sake of argument, let us say that there is no nibbāna where all the cycles of defilement, actions, and results cease. Then no one in this Universe can find peace. In the absence of nibbāna, defilement will play havoc with our lives to produce action, which will bring about results, which will create conditions for the arising of a new group of aggregates attended by suffering. It is only the Path and its Fruition that can exterminate defilements, and this extermination will bring the cycle of suffering to an end. This cessation of suffering is real. Buddhas and Arahants actually reach this stage, and after their parinibbāna all sufferings come to an end.</FONT>

or in the world of Form, such as the world of corporeal brahmas, etc. Possessing solidity, men, devas, and brahmas assume shapes and forms. Cessation means the end of such shapes and forms that possess mass. In the absence of mass, there are no elements of fluidity, thermal energy, and motive force.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Matter is Non-existent in Nibbāna</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the absence of the four primary elements there can be no derived materiality <I>(upāda rūpa) </I>formed by these four elements, for instance, the eye and the sight, the ear and the sound, etc. Since they are absent there will be no phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., which occur in the sensual realm as sense-sphere consciousness and in the Form Sphere as form-sphere consciousness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Consider this: without eyes one cannot see, without ears one cannot hear, without nose one cannot smell, without tongue one cannot taste, and without body one cannot get the sensation of touch. The physical sense bases are the seat of sensation, or the five sense organs that form the bases of consciousness. Devoid of the organs of sense, consciousness cannot arise. In the world of the brahmas, only the eye-base <I>(cakkhu pasāda)</I> and ear-base <I>(sota pasāda)</I> exist — nose-base <I>(ghāna 
pasāda),</I> tongue-base <I>(jivhā pasāda),</I> and body-base <I>(kāya pasāda)</I> being absent. So brahmas may possess noses and tongues in rudimentary forms or bodies or masses in great dimensions, but they do not know what smell is, what taste is, or what bodily impression is. However, there is the seat of consciousness usually called the heart-base <I>(hadaya vatthu),</I> in all sentient beings, whether celestial or human. So in these three realms, thought, knowledge, and absorptions can occur.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As I have said, as there are no primary elements in nibbāna, all matter dependent on these four elements are non-existent. Because of the absence of matter, there is no consciousness appertaining to the realm of the senses or to the realm of form — as, for instance, the first jhānic consciousness. For brevity’s sake I will discuss only about mind <I>(citta),</I> but whenever mind is mentioned one must remember it is accompanied by mental concomitants <I>(cetasikā).</I> Now the question arises whether in nibbāna there are still extant consciousness that arises without depending on matter as, for example, formless consciousness.</FONT>

Nothingness, or to the abode of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. In the realm of the Infinity of Space, rebirth-linking begins with the advent of consciousness relating to kamma result, mind and mental concomitants. For ordinary people, during the course of existence between rebirth-linking and death, wholesome or unwholesome consciousness, together with their concomitants arise. When such ordinary people are duly trained in the Dhamma they are known as trainees <I>(sekkha).</I></FONT><I></I>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Such trainees may become Arahants when they are reborn in the realm of the infinity of Space. In that case, only wholesome and functional consciousness arise together with their respective concomitants, but matter is absent there. Only mind and mental concomitants — all in a state of flux — are present. In that realm all phenomena are psychical. It just occurs to me that psychic beings need no 
food, clothing, or shelter, but it is usual for artists to depict this realm and others of the Formless Sphere as having palaces and mansions. However, in nibbāna they will be superfluous, as in nibbāna there is neither mind or matter.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Today non-Buddhists have become highly interested in space, but the space they have in mind is space in the physical sense. They may not be able to 
assimilate the idea of the existence of the realm of Infinity of Space, but the Buddha clearly differentiates the realm of mind and its constituents together with its state of absorptions from the realm of no-mind where all its concomitants and absorptions are nullified. A meditator who concentrates his or her mind on the rise and fall of the aggregates can aspire to reach the stage of knowledge of equanimity about formations. If he or she reaches that stage, he or she would feel the 
disappearance of the physical self, experiencing only a stream of consciousness that floats in space. As his or her knowledge progresses, this stream will become clearer and clearer. Strictly speaking, this is not absorption on Infinity of Space, but it is an insight akin to that absorption.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">From the foregoing it may also be adduced that there is no consciousness and its concomitant 
appertaining to the realm of Infinity of Consciousness, and the same may be said of consciousness and its concomitant appertaining to the realm of Nothingness, and of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. The highest plane of existence is where perception is so subtle that it can be described as an intermediate stage between perception and non-perception. Equally subtle are contact, feeling, consciousness, and mental formations — concomitants of the mind that can be met with in that realm. 
In nibbāna such subtleties of the mind are entirely absent.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those lacking confidence in the Dhamma and unable to realise the attainment of jhāna or ecstatic meditation (samāpatti), dispute all teachings relating to the realms of existence just described. What such sceptics should do is to practise insight meditation as taught by the Buddha. If they do they will attain jhāna that belongs 
to the realm of Neither Perception nor Non-perception, and realise for themselves the difference between the jhānic state in the Formless Sphere and nibbāna where such a state becomes redundant. It is futile to reject jhāna and nibbāna without any practical investigation.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Absence of Mind and Matter in Nibbāna</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In nibbāna there are no such things as mind or mental concomitants, which can be met with in the sense-sphere or form-sphere. It naturally follows that mind and matter that belong to the thirty-one planes of existence are totally absent in nibbāna. However, some would like to propose that after the parinibbāna of the Buddha and the Arahants, they acquire a special kind of mind and matter in nibbāna. Such an extraordinary way of 
thinking may appeal to those who cannot do away with self or ego.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With regard to this proposition a learned Sayādaw reasoned that if there is a special kind of mind and matter in nibbāna, there must also be a special kind of rebirth which gives rise to a special kind of old age, disease, and death, which in turn bring about a special kind of sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, and 
despair. When the teachings explicitly say cessation, it will be improper to go beyond it and formulate an idea of a special kind of existence. Extinction points to nothing other than Nothingness. Nibbāna, which is not involved in mind and matter, cannot be made to get involved either in this world or in other worlds.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Nibbāna is Beyond All Realms</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

Hence in nibbāna there is no sun nor moon. Where no new bodies of the aggregates arise there can be no darkness or light. Yet the question might arise whether it is possible for sentient beings to come to nibbāna in the way that beings from the lower realms come to the human world, or beings from the human world come to the world of devas. However, in nibbāna there are no such comings. The usual term to describe the realisation of nibbāna is that the Buddhas and Arahants “enter” nibbāna, or specifically, anupādisesa nibbāna. This does not mean the arrival of new aggregates, but the cutting off of the flow of mind and matter that causes existence. It is the complete extinction of aggregates; and this extinction is recognised as <I>anupādisesa nibbāna</I>. 
It is not a place where beings make their landing from other planes of existence.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">No one goes out or gets transported from nibbāna to other planes of existence either.

Hence all these Four Noble Truths can be discovered in the bodies of beings belonging to this universe.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

Before entering parinibbāna, Arahants still carry the burden of the aggregates, which all cease to arise after their parinibbāna. It may be said that this cessation takes place inside the body of the Arahants. Hence we speak conventionally of the existence of nibbāna inside our bodies of the aggregates. According, to the Abhidhamma, however, nibbāna is extraneous to the body. That is why in the Udāna

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The truth of suffering relates to the suffering inherent in the five aggregates of attachment, which arises in the sense-base as reflected by the sense-object which enters the sense-door. When you look at a thing, the eye base receives the image of the eye-object through the eye-door, and the contact established between the base and the object lets you know that you have seen the thing. This phenomenon of seeing is quite obvious. 
You know that you have eyes and feel that you are in full possession of them. You, as a seer, exist. The object you see is clear and pleasing to your mind. Consider in like manner the remaining phenomena of hearing, tasting, and so on. Whenever each of them arises, attachment to the sense-object under observation is developed. When you see someone, you recognise that someone as man or woman possessing features which appear as agreeable to you. You at once get attached to him or her. Your eye 
and the eye-object constitute the aggregates of attachment to form or matter.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When you recognise what you see, you should know that consciousness is operating, you now have the aggregate of attachment to consciousness. Having seen the object, feelings pleasurable or otherwise, arise in you. Now you have developed the aggregate of attachment to feeling. You usually note what you see so that 
you can recall it to mind when occasion demands. Perception has developed in you, and you now have the aggregate of attachment to perception. Then there are the volitional activities that take place in your mind in relation to wholesome or unwholesome deeds that you commit. Such mental states outside the domain of feeling and perception constitute formations to which you get attached. Thus arises the aggregate of attachment to mental formations. Now from this act of seeing, hearing, etc., all 
the five aggregates of attachment have arisen.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">These aggregates are always arising in us, but the arising is so instantaneous that we hardly notice it. We almost always fail to capture the moment when the phenomenon occurs. However, with mindfulness we can note the arising and passing away of the aggregates of attachment to realise the fact that this state of flux is highly unsatisfactory, 
and that is suffering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">These five aggregates of attachment form this universe. They reveal the truth of suffering. An ordinary individual fails to note seeing just as he or she sees, and is thus unable to grasp the true nature of the phenomenon at the instant it arises. He or she feels that seeing is pleasurable, takes suffering for pleasure, and thus a liking for pleasure develops. This is 
craving, which becomes intensified as attachment. As he or she makes efforts to fulfil desires to appease the attachment, formations take place. Now mental formations are brought into play. Because of the action of formations, a dying person perceives through the mind-door his or her own actions <I>(kamma),</I> signs of actions <I>(kamma-nimitta),</I> and signs of destiny <I>(gati-nimitta).</I> The mind will incline towards these objects because of attachment. It is like the case of a drowning man, who grasps whatever object comes by. The dying person grasps the mind object. Then decease-consciousness occurs, and as he or she leaves the aggregates behind, this consciousness recedes into the past. </FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, as attachment has not been eradicated, the mind-object, derived from the decease-consciousness of the previous existence, influences the rebirth-linking consciousness that has just occurred in this present existence. Thus a new life begins with a new consciousness and this links the past with the present. Thus it is called rebirth-linking consciousness. This consciousness is succeeded by 
mental contents of the factor of life. Whenever consciousness occurs, its concomitants follow. Then material phenomena that are dependent on them arise. If craving cannot be cut off, these mental and material phenomena continue to arise ad-infinitum throughout samsāra. Hence, craving is the cause that brings about this universe, and since this universe is a mass of suffering, it holds up the truth of the cause of suffering for all to see.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching are all the factors of suffering, and it is on that score that craving becomes the cause. Because of this cause, we like to see, hear, taste, smell, and touch, and suffering arises again. These are the truth of suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Meditating on the Four Elements</FONT>
</H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Consciousness occurs when contact is established between the sense-base and the sense-object. A meditator starts with the practice of concentrating his mind on this phenomenon of consciousness that arises originally from the four essential material properties, namely, solidity <I>(pathavī),</I> thermal energy <I>(tejo),</I> motive force <I>(vāyo),</I> and fluidity <I>(āpo).</I> When the Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta says, “I know I am going when I go” it is a direction to the meditator to know the element of motion that is brought into play through the contact that excited consciousness. When you are sitting, know that you are sitting, noting the physical tension brought about by the act of sitting. You might then be aware of other physical or mental phenomena taking place in conjunction with the posture that you are assuming. For instance, you might have noticed that as you sit, your feet are touching each other, your hands are interlocking, your clothes are clinging to your body, and so forth. When you observe them with mindfulness you will come to realise the nature of the activities of matter that arise as sense-base and sense-object come into contact with each other.</FONT>
</P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Easy"></A>An Easy Method of Meditation</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">So that both the young and old can take up meditation, we prescribe what we consider to be an easy course in insight meditation beginning with noting the rising and falling of the abdomen. As you breathe in the abdomen becomes distended, and 
as you breathe out it subsides. You will experience the motion of the rising and falling of the abdominal wall and recognise it as the activity of the element of motion. You note this. That is to say, you concentrate your mind on the rising and falling of the abdomen with the intellectual appreciation of the nature of the phenomenon. There should be no respite between noting the two consecutive movements. Keep your mind fixed on the start of the rising movement following it till it ends, and 
switch over to the start of the falling movement till it also ends. If, in the process, you notice that there is some gap after breathing in or after breathing out, you must be mindful that you are sitting (if you sit while meditating). </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At times ideas will form in your mind, as you think of something. Or you may have some intention to do this or that. Note all such ideas. Whenever your mind 
drifts away from the main stream of mindfulness, follow it. Don’t let it escape your attention. Continue noting the phenomenon of thinking. Then resume noting the movements of your abdomen. Sometimes you may encounter sensations, mostly unpleasant, because you feel stiff and tired, or hot and painful as you sit meditating. In that case, note this tiredness and pain, and when such sensations disappear concentrate your attention again on the rising and falling of the abdomen. </FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To put it briefly, please note the movements of the abdomen, both your physical and psychological behaviour and experience so that there can be no interval in the whole process of meditation during which your mind is kept idle. If you have no special object on which to focus your attention, you keep on noting as usual the rising and falling of your abdomen which is distended and tense at one moment and 
relaxed and flaccid at the next.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As your power of concentration improves you will notice that each movement of the muscle has many distinct phases of action that may be called incidents and that each incident arises and then disappears. Each appearance or disappearance that occurs in succession is palpable. This observation applies to the mind-object. The noting mind, the subject, also 
behaves in much the same way as the object, now appearing and now disappearing in quick succession. As your observation gets keener, moment by moment, you recognise every part of the phenomenon that occurs and dissolves, as if each has been set apart from the other to take its own course.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the noting mind and the noted mind-object come to pass as if only for the sake of dissolution, it now 
dawns upon you that they are transient. They are forever in a state of flux. It is their inherent nature to arise and vanish. Such transience is most unsatisfactory. What is unsatisfactory is suffering. Now you have arrived at the knowledge of the truth of suffering. This realisation dispels ignorance, so craving fails to assert itself as your mind-object. As craving is absent, attachment, cannot act as its accomplice. As no attachment occurs, no volitional activities can operate for the 
satisfaction of desires conjured up by the mind and its object. It means that no actions can be formed, when we say that no formations arise. When formations cease, no rebirth-linking consciousness can take place. So there will be no new birth, that is to say no new aggregates. This indicates the cessation of both suffering and the cause leading to suffering. At that particular instant when you recognise this cessation you realise nibbāna. This may be only for one moment, but that moment is 
the most precious. Noting and knowing the phenomena which ultimately leads to the knowledge of cessation, tantamount to worldly realisation of the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. Thus it is commonly said that the Four Noble Truths reside in the body of the meditator.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As knowledge of equanimity about formations is achieved, one becomes so absorbed in meditation that 
one feels one’s body, together with its sense of touch and perception, comes to cessation. Hence the text further says:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“In nibbāna this body, together with its sense of touch and the working of faculties, sense-bases, ceases. One must be aware of such cessation.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This, in 
effect, is the realisation of the peace of nibbāna through the Noble Path. Hence the Commentaries add:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“In this one fathom long body is proclaimed the world, where the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the Noble Eightfold Path can be discovered. Know, my dear friend, that with these words I do not proclaim 
the reality of the Four Noble Truths in such inanimate objects as grass or wood, but in the body composed of the four primary elements.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The truth of suffering is evident everywhere, but the truth of the cause of suffering can be adduced from the intrinsic nature of all ordinary people who cannot get rid of mental defilements. Before one can tread the path one can search for the cause 
through introspection of one’s own body. The truth of the cessation of the cause is said (conventionally) to be present in the Noble Ones despite the fact that they may have some residues of defilements and aggregates within them.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With Arahants, however, as defilements have been eradicated, cessation is said to have been achieved. The Noble Truth of the Eightfold Path can, of course, be 
discovered in the body of the Arahant heading for the Path and its Fruition. Here it is meant to show that the peace of nibbāna can be realised only with the total extinction of mind and matter and its concomitants.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Suffering and its Cause Manifest During Ideation</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the foregoing 
I have shown how the aggregates of attachment arise through the interaction of sense-bases like the eye, ear, etc., and of sense objects like form, sound, etc. Now I shall deal with the interaction between the mind and mind-object — which, in ordinary language, is ideation — that gives rise to aggregates of attachment. Introspection into the nature of ideation will give out the truth relating to suffering and its cause.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As you think, you are aware where the seat of thinking lies. Obviously it lies in your body and in your heart-base. Add to them the mind-object. Depending on these three-factors of the process of ideation, thoughts, intentions, desires, etc., arise. If you fail to note the true nature of this process, you might be led to believe that the entire physical body together with its mind base is your own self.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Here I am,” you might say to your self, “this body is mine. It is I who am thinking. This is my thought. I am the mind-object. Or, he is the mind-object.” You might formulate such ideas in your head, but in fact the phenomena that arise as you think and try to know what you think are all the aggregates of attachment. These aggregates are all a mass of suffering. Now you see the truth of suffering. These aggregates 
of attachment may be categorised as follows:</FONT></P><OL><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At the time of ideation, the mind-base and the body which forms the seat of the mind start operating. They constitute the aggregate of attachment to matter.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then thinking occurs. All thoughts and ideas constitute the 
aggregate of attachment to consciousness.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then feelings arise, discriminating between pleasure and pain generally. They constitute the aggregate of attachment to feelings.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then perceptions arise noting the mind-object. They constitute the aggregate of attachment to 
perceptions.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then mental formations occur. They constitute the aggregate of attachment to mental formations.</FONT></DIV></LI></OL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The last-mentioned aggregate, the products of volition, are extremely conspicuous, you can find them everywhere. When consciousness arises through seeing, 
hearing, etc., mental formations take place in the form of thoughts and emotions. This is how desire and attachment for the pleasures of the senses arise. As you see or hear things, you discriminate between good and bad or between wholesome and unwholesome. There will be an affinity for things you consider to be pleasant, but when they are not to your liking, anger, disgust, and loathing assail your mind. This leads you to the growth of egoistical pride that persuades you to formulate wrong 
views. Then doubts, jealousy, anxiety, and restlessness come trailing behind to trouble you. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On the other hand, it is also possible for you to have developed wholesome thoughts like faith, charity, mindfulness, forbearance, sympathy, kindness, etc., as you think wisely regarding the sense-objects that you observe. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">All these tendencies, whether wholesome or otherwise are aggregates of mental formations. When you intend to sit, or stand, or go, or speak, this aggregate of formations is at work. If your volition is wholesome, wholesome kamma is made; if not, then it is unwholesome. The world of these aggregates of attachment to formations is truly the world, and this world is a mass of suffering. Those unaccustomed to the application of insight 
knowledge to the absolute realities of suffering through meditation develop a wrong sense of exhilaration about their thoughts and ideas, hoping for the better even when they come face to face with misery. They are pleased with the idea of the existence of self. They long for its prosperity, mistaking suffering for happiness. In this way attachment grows in them, and they make all kinds of efforts to satisfy their desires. To appease these desires, they will not hesitate to kill, steal, 
cheat, or commit all sorts of misdeeds. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Others, however, may do wholesome deeds with a view to accumulating merits for their future lives in the cycle of existence. Formations arise in accordance with the merits or demerits that they achieve. When they are dying, actions, signs of actions, and signs of destiny appear as sense-objects to be perceived by the sense-bases, and depending on what 
appears in their mind’s eye — as we say in ordinary parlance — rebirth linking consciousness is formed in the next new existence where fresh sense-bases and sense-objects interact as before to produce craving and attachment, which all go to make up the same cycle of suffering. For the entire chain of craving, attachment, kamma, and becoming spells nothing but the truth of suffering. It is only when this chain is cut off with the knowledge of equanimity about formations that the peace of 
nibbāna can be established. So the Buddha said:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">”Where mind and perception with the mind cease, there is cessation of all faculties or sense-bases, and this should be known (by the meditator).”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This cessation is nibbāna. In the text the word “mana” is used, but this needs 
clarification. It has been used to embrace two types of consciousness, namely, life-continuum consciousness <I>(bhavanga),</I> and apprehending consciousness <I>(āvajjana). Bhavanga</I> is the state of mind that occurs while one is dreaming or half-asleep. It is not as important as apprehending consciousness, which needs to be closely observed so that you become aware of its cessation. In the text the word <I>“dhammasañña,</I>” is also used. It means the perception of the sense-object. 
With regard to this, we usually say mind <I>(citta)</I> for easier understanding. So I have rendered this apprehending consciousness simply as mind.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">What is meant here is the cessation or the extinction of the mind that takes in the mind-object, the mind that ordinarily knows, and the mind that finally apprehends. This represents the three phases of the mind in operation. Their cessation 
denotes the complete annihilation of all formations, and therein lies nibbāna. This Dhamma can be realised only with the practice of insight meditation. When the mind is inclined to nibbāna, all forms of consciousness cease, when Path consciousness and Fruition consciousness are realised.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Discovery of Nibbāna Where the Universe Ends</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the third part of this discourse, it has been shown that as we are noting the phenomenon of seeing, both the eye-base and perception of form get dissolved, that as we are noting the phenomenon of hearing, both the ear-base and perception of sound get dissolved, that as we are noting the phenomenon of smelling both the nose-base and perception of smell get dissolved, that as we are noting the phenomenon of tasting, both the 
tongue-base and perception of taste get dissolved, that as we are noting the phenomenon of touching both the body and perception of touch get dissolved, and that as we are noting ideation, both the mind and perception of ideas get dissolved. To know this dissolution or cessation of visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental perceptions at the six mind-doors denotes the realisation of the truth of cessation of the cause of suffering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Cessation cannot be realised by just thinking or imagining, but by actual practice of meditating on mind and matter until knowledge of equanimity is achieved. When it is truly realised, conviction that all conditioned things spell suffering will be gained. You will also come to the conclusion that craving for that suffering is suffering itself. When craving is dispelled no new becoming can arise. On attaining Enlightenment the 
Buddha uttered this verse of triumph expressing exultation over his conquest of craving.</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Anekajāti saṃsāraṃ, sandhāvissaṃ anibbisaṃ.

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">What is important to note is that nibbāna has no foothold <I>(appatittha).</I> It has no location. When we speak of nibbāna as residing within this fathom long body, we mean it metaphorically. This has been emphasised repeatedly. No doubt the truth of suffering and the truth of the cause of suffering are actually apparent in the body of any individual. The truth of the path lies latent in the meditator who practises insight meditation to arrive at the Noble Path. The truth of the cessation of suffering, which is nibbāna itself, resides in the body of the Noble Ones who have inclined to the Path and its Fruition. So it may be said that it is always present in the bodies of the Arahants.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, this does not mean to say that nibbāna exists with the Noble Ones in the strict materialistic sense of the word. In the heart of the Noble Ones all defilements have been exterminated. This extermination has been given a location in a figurative sense, and this has been explicitly mentioned in the Visuddhimagga thus:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Nibbāna has no location, but when speaking of the cessation of defilements, the place where defilements are situated has to be mentioned.

extinguishment takes place. Thus we can only speak figuratively of the place where nibbāna is situated. The Abhidhamma is explicit on this point. It clearly states that nibbāna is extraneous to the body. It is accomplished outside the body. Hence we say that is has no residence, no abode, and location.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As a result of listening respectfully to this discourse on nibbāna, may you attain

It hops from one object to another, whether systematically or unsystematically, in a logical sequence or in reverse order. It moves like a shuttle in weaving. In fact, the original meaning of the word relates to weaving. Past, present, and future existences are woven into a pattern as variegated as human imagination could create. Nibbāna has as its aim the liberation from the clutches of craving. The texts say <I>“Vānato nikkhantanti nibbānam” </I>— 
nibbāna is a departure from craving. Another exegesis says: <I>“Natthi vanam etthati nibbānam”</I> — craving is not in nibbāna. All these go to show that craving does not have nibbāna as its objective.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Lust or sensual craving cherishes that sexes should be differentiated. It loves sensual pleasures derived from the senses: eyes, ears, etc. It feels bored in the absence of the five 
strands of sensual pleasures. Craving developed in the realm of form likes the existence of the Form Sphere and that developed in formless realm, likes the existence of the Formless Sphere. Those who are obsessed with craving cannot realise the ills of existence, and so they have no affinity for nibbāna where there is no becoming. People pray for nibbāna, but if told that they would be instantly transported there with all chances for a return to the present existence barred, they would 
hesitate in the manner of the devotee in the following story.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Let Me Think About It </FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A lay devotee prayed before the Buddha image that he may reach nibbāna as soon as possible. Hearing his frequent prayers, a practical joker hid himself behind the image and said with a thundering

He had to employ a number of stratagems to prompt her to go to the monastery, but once she was in the presence of Buddha, all was well, and she became an Arahant the moment she had listened to the Dhamma. There is also another story about Kāla, the son of Anāthapindika. Let us call him Maung Kāla in the Burmese way.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

He visited him and listened to his teaching. At once he became a Stream-winner and invited the Great Teacher to reside at Sāvatthī. He bought Prince Jeta’s garden for 180 million, built a monastery 
costing another 180 million, and held a libation ceremony spending still another 180 million. He donated the monastery to the Buddha and his disciples. Every day he would feed 500 monks, observing the Uposatha himself and encouraging his household to do likewise. Although he had become a donor of a monastery, his son, Maung Kāla, had no inclination for the Buddha’s Dhamma.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There was a 
reason for him not to have any sense of devotion for the Buddha and the Dhamma, for in those days people followed Purāṇa Kassapa’s heretical teachings. There were also many kinds of animists. Some worshipped Brahma as god. Had it not been for the Buddha, Anāthapiṇḍika himself would have been involved with various kinds of religious denominations current before the Buddha’s Enlightenment. Maung Kāla might also be a follower of heretical schools of religion. It might not be 
convenient for him to change from one religion to another.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The father thought about the son’s welfare: “My son does not know the Buddha. He cannot appreciate the Dhamma or the Sangha. He has no desire to go to the monastery. He has no inclination to listen to the Dhamma. He shuns doing chores for the convenience of the monks. Should he die a heretic he would surely go to Avīcī, the 
lowest of the hell realms. That my son is not a Buddhist is the height of impropriety. If he gets to Avīcī while I am still living, it will be worse. Money can change the mind of many. I must send him to the monastery at the risk of indulging in bribery.” Thinking thus, the millionaire told his son that he would give him a hundred <I>kahāpanas</I> if he would go to the monastery, and his son accepted the offer.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When he got to the monastery Maung Kāla chose a cosy corner where he slept heartily, for he had no mind to listen to the Dhamma. When he came home, the father fed him well in the belief that his son had kept the Uposatha. Maung Kāla was always after money and so he had his meal only after he had been paid. Next the rich man told him that if only he would listen to the Dhamma and relate just one stanza of it to the father, he would 
be rewarded with a thousand <I>kahāpanas.</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Maung Kāla paid another visit to the monastery and this time he listened carefully to what the Buddha taught. The Teacher knew him well, and he purposely delivered several discourses that the rich man’s son could not easily commit to memory. As the stipulation with his father was to retell what Buddha taught even if it be but one 
verse, he now took special care to understand. Reaching understanding, his faith developed, and at this opportune moment the Buddha taught him so that he could understand well. Having accumulated perfections in the past, Maung Kāla at once attained to Stream-winning.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Now a Stream-winner, his faith in the Dhamma became steadfast, all doubts and wrong views having been dispelled. On that 
particular day he did not go home by himself early, but, instead remained behind in the company of the Buddha and his disciples. When they visited the rich man’s house for alms, he followed them. On reaching the house he became worried that his father might give the thousand <I>kahāpanas</I> to him in the presence of the Buddha, for, he did not want it to be known that he went to the monastery with a pecuniary motive. A sense of shame had overtaken him. As usual he took his meals after the Buddha and the monks, but this time he took care not to make himself conspicuous. Nevertheless, Anāthapiṇḍika came to him and paid him the money as promised saying that it was a reward for his son’s attendance at the monastery to keep the Uposatha, and listen to the Dhamma. He was greatly embarrassed and refused to accept the money. The father related the whole incident to the Buddha, saying that on this particular day his son had radiated happiness unlike on previous occasions when greed seized him.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha said, “Your son has become a Stream-winner who is nobler than a universal monarch, a deva, or a brahma.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A Stream-winner far excels a universal monarch. Almost everyone likes to be a king. Even being a village headman has its appeal. A kingdom is better than a principality. A 
bigger kingdom is far better. An emperor is more powerful than a feudal Lord. A monarch ruling the entire continent would be far more powerful. If one became a universal monarch, lord of all four continents, what more can be said? Wielding his magic wheel of authority and shining in an aura of virtue, all emperors and kings bow to him. Because of his virtuousness, all his subjects possess affluence, solidarity, and righteousness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

The monarch’s happiness would last only for his lifetime. If he rules the universe with kingly virtues, he may be reborn after his death in heaven, but no one can say for certain whether he would be destined for nibbāna or for the four lower realms. However, once a devotee becomes a 
Stream-winner, all doors to the lower realms will be closed for him. Should he or she go to heaven, he or she has only seven more existences, and will be destined for Arahantship subsequently attaining to the state of complete annihilation of the cycles of suffering after parinibbāna. The Buddha thus praised Maung Kāla whose life was far better than that of a Universal monarch.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Excels A Deva or Brahma </FONT>

There are six celestial planes of existence, of which Cātumahārājika is the lowest in the order. Even there, devas enjoy long lives. A day in that plane is equivalent to fifty years of life on this earth. The span of life of a deva in Cātumahārājika is 500 celestial years, which equals nine million years of our human world. Humans live to be 
a hundred, in which case a deva’s life is ninety thousand times longer than human life. They possess not only longevity, but also beauty. They enjoy happiness more than we do. The devas of Tāvatimsa excel those of Cātumahārājika. Their span of life is three times longer than that of the residents of the lower plane. Computed to earth-years, their span of life equals thirty-six million years. Longevity of the Yāma devas is four times that of Tāvatimsa, so the span of life there is 144 
million earth-years. Calculating the earth-years in the same way, a Tusita deva’s longevity is 576 million years, a Nimmānarati deva’s is 2,304 million years and a Paranimmitavassavatī deva’s is 9,216 million. Whatever their longevity, they cannot escape from the four lower realms, for when they die, they may be reborn into this human world, fall into bad company, and commit evil deeds. Not being destined for nibbāna despite their supernormal attainments, they cannot get away from 
the turning of the wheel of existence, and so they will be subject to disease and death. Stream-winners give a wide birth to four woeful states and they have only seven existences to undergo before attaining <I>parinibbāna.</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The lives of brahmas are far nobler and better than those of the devas.

also enjoy peace. Their lives last from one-third of a world-cycle to 84,000 world cycles. Yet when brahmas die, they revert to the world of the senses where, if they happen to commit evil, they could also go down to the lower realms. They are subject to cycles of suffering like aging and death, as they return to the sensual world. For Stream-winners, however, there are no hells awaiting them, and they are destined for nibbāna after seven existences.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">What I would like to emphasise in the story of Maung Kāla is, firstly, the fact that he had to be coaxed into listening to the Dhamma although he had long gained perfections that prepared him for the state of a Stream-winner, and, secondly, that craving is anathema to nibbāna. One obsessed with craving would not heed any teaching that points the way to nibbāna. I would also like to remind you 
that once a Stream-winner is within sight of nibbāna, he has but seven existences to go during which he will, as of course, be subjected to miseries and sufferings.

Brahmas have no sexual characteristics and so they do not have any desire for sensual pleasures derived from sexual relations. They are very happy in that state, but the lustful have no desire to be sexless brahmas. They considers the absence of sexual pleasure as misery. Brahmas live without eating. Where there is no need for food, no 
desire for it can arise; and this in itself should be happiness as lack of necessity for the daily round of food does away with many troubles. However, sensuous beings love gustatory pleasures, and so to them absence of those pleasures means misery. Where contact is absent, no pleasurable tactile sensations can be enjoyed. This can also bring happiness, for it does away with desire. Because of this nature, those entranced in the jhānic state of the Form Spheres feel happy. Sensuous beings 
regard life in those spheres as unhappy because they are obsessed with sensual pleasures.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Beings in the Realms of Form Dislike the Absence of Form</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In Formless Spheres mental phenomena like mind and volition dominate.

Those who have perfected themselves in arūpa jhāna can get to any one of these four planes where matter is totally absent. They live in the world of ideation where there is no material suffering. Those possessing craving for sensuality and materiality do not like to be reborn in any of the Formless Realms, but the occupants of those planes of 
formless existence are quite happy with their psychological conditions. They are, however, in a dead end.

world-cycles; but when they pass away they may be reborn in sense-spheres. Ālāra and Udaka, who first taught meditation to the Bodhisatta before he practised austerities, lost an invaluable opportunity to see the light of the Dhamma when the Buddha attained Enlightenment because they happened to be reborn in one of the Formless Realms, which is included in eight kinds of existence remote from the path of deliverance. If one gets to any one of the four Formless Realms as an ordinary 
individual, one would surely miss the Path.

It is an image conceptualised by the meditator as light, which extends everywhere completely without limit. Or, in other words, it is a contemplation device on which a concept is imagined. Hence, <I>āloka kasina</I> is usually rendered as “light device,” and <I>ākāsa kasina</I> as “space device.” The practice of any one of these objects of meditation can lead the meditator to the realisation of nibbāna.

have stopped while you are still running.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Angulimāla was bewildered on hearing the Buddha say that it was he himself who was running while the great monk had stopped, when, in fact, it was the other way round. He sought an explanation, and the Buddha explained: “Angulimāla! I have stopped running through the endless cycles of existence as I have discarded defilements. You cherish the 
defilements and are still spinning in the whirlpool of samsāra.” Forthwith Angulimāla saw the light of wisdom and requested admission into the Sangha. The Buddha said, “Come monk!” and the murderer became a monk. In this case, proximity was made to appear remote through the exercise of supernormal powers.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Venerable Mahāmoggallāna converted Kosiya the miser, and brought him and his 
wife to the Jetavana monastery from the village of Sakkhara near Rājagaha by invoking his supernormal powers. He worked the miracle of bringing the gate of the monastery to the door-steps of the rich man’s mansion. In this case remoteness was made to appear proximate.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">No doubt displaying such supernormal powers contributes to the development of piety; but they can be discredited by 
unbelievers who might say: “In the country of Gandhāra, there are magicians who can conjure up wondrous forms and images. Your Teacher might be well-versed in that kind of Gandhāran magic.” The Buddha questioned Kevatta in that way, and he admitted that it could happen. This would not be good for the dispensation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are other drawbacks with regard to the exhibition of supernormal 
powers. It would contradict the observance of right livelihood if monks accept gifts donated in consideration of the exercise of those powers with sincere motives. If the use of supernormal powers was allowed, devotees would be more inclined to support those with supernormal powers than ordinary monks practising morality, in which case the precepts kept by the monk with supernormal powers will have been broken. This is considered unwholesome. A monk may have attained Arahantship, but he may 
not possess supernormal powers. Because of this, a layman’s faith and devotion may dwindle. This will affect the prosperity of the dispensation. If that is the case the monk exhibiting supernormal powers will naturally be held responsible, he will be held to have committed unwholesome deeds, and this will do him no good. After Venerable Pindola used supernormal powers at the suggestion of Venerable Mahāmoggallāna for the acquisition of a sandalwood bowl, the Buddha forbade the display of 
supernormal powers.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Power of Mind Reading</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The higher knowledge of knowing the thoughts of others — mind reading is <I>“cetopariya abhiññā.”</I> To know the minds of others is a supernormal power.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"

On one occasion Kassapa invited the Buddha to a feast. The Buddha, however, did not attend the feast on the appointed day, but only on the next day. When asked why, the Buddha said, “Is it not the case that on the day of the feast it occurred to you that it would be better if I did not come as invited, since, if I came and 
displayed psychic powers, people’s devotion would grow more towards me rather than towards you?” It then occurred to Kassapa that the Buddha was more powerful as he could read other people’s minds. There and then devotion to the Buddha developed in him. Thus he was converted by the Buddha who exercised his powers of mind reading.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Once, the Buddha was walking for alms in the village of 
Uttarakā with Sunakkhatta, a monk belonging to the Licchavī clan. On the way, the latter saw Korakkhattiya, a heretic doing the “dog-practice” by which he imitated the behaviour of a dog. In a previous existence Sunakkhatta had followed such a practice, so when he saw the ascetic imitating a dog, he felt a sense of affinity for him. The Buddha chastised him, “It is surprising that you call yourself a son of the Sakyan!”(<A NAME="15"></A></FONT><A HREF="#Notes"><FONT SIZE="-1"

His instructions to his disciples always related to right thinking. His exhortations are mainly concerned with noting and observing phenomena. His teachings encourage doing good and shunning evil. His method of admonition is flawless. Anyone who practises what he teaches may become proficient in the establishment of morality, mindfulness, and wisdom till he realises the Path and its Fruition. Supernormal powers may be the most potent in the art of persuasion, but they cannot render the defilements extinct, which is most important in his teaching. In the Kevatta Sutta, the Buddha cites the following case of a monk in search of the way to bring about the cessation of the four primary elements.</FONT>

He possessed the higher knowledge of psychic powers, so he went up to the six planes of devas in search of an answer. All the devas in 
Cātumahārāja, Tāvatiṃsa, Yāma, Tusita, Nimmānaratī, and Paranimmitavassavatī advised him to approach the Great Brahma to get the solution to his riddle on the four elements. So he went to the Great Brahma and asked him where the extermination of the four elements takes place. “O monk!” Said the Great Brahma, “I am the greatest. I surpass all; none surpasses me; I see all. Everything comes into being as I will it. I am the Lord of the Universe. I create the Earth and its 
inhabitants. I am the Creator. I am the father of all who come into being now and also of all who will come into being in the future.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Brahmajāla Sutta discusses the theory of creation. According to it, at the beginning of the world, a brahma came into being in the plane of the brahmas. He was then alone. As the gained longevity, he felt oppressed with this loneliness and so he 
thought to himself that it would be great if he could have company. At this juncture some of the people on this earth gained jhāna and were reborn in the plane where the Great Brahmā was residing. The new-comers were not as powerful as himself. So he thought that they came into being because he willed them to be. They died in the course of time; but he remained. Thus lesser brahmas recognised him as their Creator.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, the monk was not asking whether or not the Great Brahma was really the Great Brahma who created the Universe. He only wanted to know the place where the four elements meet their end. So he repeated the riddle; and the Great Brahma kept on saying that he was the Creator. As the questioner was persistent, he was at long last obliged to tell him the truth in the absence of all other brahmas, for, he did not want to let them 
know his ignorance and, thereby, lose his prestige as the all-knowing and all-powerful.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“O monk!” He confided, “I do not know anything about the cessation of the elements.

approached Buddha and asked: “Venerable Sir! Where do the four primary elements come to cessation without leaving any residue?”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha likened the monk to a bird flying out from a ship at sea in search of land. Not being able to reach land, it comes back to the ship. “You should not have posed the question in the way that you did,” said the Buddha, “Your question suggests that 
there is a definite place outside the body where the cessation of the elements occurs. In fact, there is no such place. You should have asked where the four elements lose their footing; that is to say where they lose their existence. Likewise you should have asked where do long and short, great and small, and good and bad, lose their footing. You should also have asked where do mind and matter get totally annihilated leaving no residue. If you ask like this, you will have the answer.”</FONT>

However, some may go away with the idea that, because cessation is often emphasised, it means nothingness. Actually it is an absolute reality; and if that reality were to be denied there will be nothing left but defilements, actions, 
results, and aggregates, and no one will be able to get away from this whirling cycle of rebirths <I>(samsāra).</I> This cycle can actually be stopped with the diligent practice of the Middle Way. Arahants do away with it after the occurrence of their decease-consciousness following their parinibbāna. It shows that the bliss of nibbāna can actually be established.

This shows that remedies are available for a number of diseases notwithstanding the fact that cancer is incurable.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha’s mother was Mahāmāyā Devī. Her younger sister was Mahāpājāpati Gotamī. Both were the daughters of King Añjana of Devadaha, near Kapilavatthu. King Suddhodana of Kapilavatthu married both sisters. Court astrologers predicted that sons born to these two queens would become universal monarchs.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">According to the 
ancients, the normal span of human life was a hundred years. For chronological purposes it is divided into three periods, each period being again divided into three portions of time. It is in the natural order of things for mothers of Bodhisattas to give birth in the last part of the second period of life. Based on that statement I have calculated that Mahā Māyā bore the son, Prince Siddhattha, when she was past fifty-six. By today’s standards this may not be possible, but in those days 
of longevity it is reasonable to fix the age as I do.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Seven days after giving birth to the Prince, who was destined to become a Buddha she died to be reborn in Tusitā as a deva. Mahāpajāpati Gotamī, who might have been about fifty-four, succeeded her elder sister as chief queen, and soon she also gave birth to Prince Nanda. She nurtured both her own son and her elder sister’s, but she 
breast-fed her step-son leaving her own son to the care of a wet nurse. For that reason Burmese Buddhists say that the Buddha was highly indebted to his step-mother.<BR>Prince Siddhattha grew to the age of sixteen when he was married to Yasodharā, the daughter of King Suppabuddha of Devadaha. Lolling in the lap of luxury of royalty, he enjoyed life to the full until he became disgusted with it; and at the age of twenty-nine he renounced the world to become a recluse. For six years he 
practised austerities, which he abandoned in the end, realising that they did not help in the search for Enlightenment. He then adopted the Middle Way, and attained enlightenment on the full moon day of Kason (about May) when he was thirty-five years of age.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">After the attainment of Buddhahood, he went to the Deer Park in Isipatana; and on the full moon day of Wāso (about July) he taught the 
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta to the group of five monks, among whom Kondañña became a Stream-winner on the very first day he heard the Dhamma. The other four followed suit after one, two, three, and four days respectively. On the fifth waning of Wāso, the Buddha taught the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta when all five monks became Arahants. During the first Rains Retreat fifty-five monks headed by Yasa attained Arahantship. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">By the end of the first Rains the Buddha had gathered around him sixty Arahants whom he sent all over the country to propagate the Dhamma. He himself converted 1,000 ascetics led by Uruvela Kassapa. They all became Arahants and accompanied the Buddha to Rājagaha. At the first gathering of welcome extended to him by King Bimbisāra and his 110,000 subjects, the Buddha preached the Four Noble Truths. Having realised them, the king 
built the Veluvana monastery for the Buddha who took up residence there teaching the Dhamma around Rājagaha and Gijjhakuta hill. When King Suddhodana came to know of this, he sent ten court officials, each with a following of 1,000 to persuade his son, now the Enlightened One, to come to Kapilavatthu. However, none of the emissaries ever returned as they all sought ordination under the wing of the teaching. At last the king sent Kāludāyī explicitly enjoining him to sing an ode to the 
beauty of summer in sixty stanzas, for it is usually the best season for travel any time anywhere. I give below my own translation of two of the stanzas which can be recited as a devotional practice.</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Trees have shed their leaves and donned a new foliage of flaming red that engulfs the entire forest.

of sixty yojanas, walking one yojana a day, and arrived on the full moon day of Kason (about May). All the relatives welcomed him and brought him to the Nigrodhārāma monastery.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The men of the Sākyan clan were known for their pride. The Buddha was then only thirty-six, and so the relatives who were older than him were loth to pay homage. They preferred to remain at the back pushing in 
front their younger brothers, sons, nephews, and grandsons who would worship the Enlightened One. In order that the whole Sākyan clan could know the virtues of an Enlightened One, the Buddha performed a feat of supernormal power, creating a huge walkway where he walked as his body spewed fire and water together. On seeing this, King Suddhodana paid homage to his son and thereafter all followed his example. King Suddhodana and Queen Gotamī become Stream-winners.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The next morning, the Buddha, accompanied by 20,000 monks, went round the city of Kapilavatthu for alms. Yasodharā saw this from the window of her palace and reported the matter to the king saying that it was beneath the dignity of a king’s son to go about begging. King Suddhodana was ashamed and rushed out from his palace to the Buddha and protested, “Why do you put me to shame by going round the city begging? Do you 
think that I cannot feed you and your 20,000 followers?” The Buddha told his father that it is the practice of all Buddhas to go round for alms in the event that no individual donor had invited them to visit his or her house for an offering of alms. He then uttered this stanza:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Uttiṭṭhe nappamajjeyya, dhammaṃ sucaritaṃ care.

 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Commentaries point out that development of joy in thinking of the nobility of the Buddha’s virtues can lead one to the attainment of insight into the transient nature of the phenomenon of joy as it arises and passes away. For present day individuals a whole day of meditation is not sufficient for the development of concentration. It may take them a week or so to gain it in order to realise the 
nature of mind and matter. For King Suddhodana, however, realisation of the Dhamma was immediate because he had perfected himself for such realisation since time immemorial. So when he came to know that the conduct of a recluse required the Buddha and his disciples not to ask for food verbally, but simply to stand in front of the house of a would-be donor, his mind became well-disposed towards the Buddha for such noble conduct. It led him to the development of joy. He meditated on that joy 
and realised its nature of origination and dissolution. In an instant, insight knowledge matured and he became a Stream-winner. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The king took the bowl from the Buddha’s hands and invited all the monks to his palace where he intended to make a grand offering. Once in the presence of Queen Mahāpajāpati Gotamī and the courtiers, the Buddha again lauded the virtues of a recluse’s 
conduct, on hearing which the Buddha’s step-mother also became a Stream-winner.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Cousin Nanda and Son Rāhula</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The next day the king held a ceremony to install Prince Nanda, his son by Mahāpajāpati Gotamī, as Prince Regent, and to mark the occasion he made offerings of alms to 
the Buddha and his disciples. When it was over, the Buddha gave his alms-bowl to his cousin, Prince Nanda, and returned to the monastery.

A week later, Rāhula, the Buddha’s son, came to the monastery to ask for his inheritance from his father at his mother’s bidding. The Buddha told Venerable Sāriputta to ordain him, and so he became a novice <I>(sāmanera).</I> Soon after that the Enlightened One gave Suddhodana a discourse on the Mahā Dhammapālā Jātaka, and the latter forthwith attained to the stage of Non-returning.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

Their wives, now without their men, became weary of life and 
approached Gotamī to request the Buddha to admit women into the Sangha as they all wanted to become bhikkhunīs.

Referring to this fact, we used to say that Arahants deny 
themselves wholesome kamma or actions that earn merit. This does not mean the abrogation of wholesome deeds, but it emphasises the absence of results that should have accrued from them. Arahants do perform such meritorious duties as doing obeisance to Buddha and the Sangha, practice <I>jhāna</I> and insight meditation, but these wholesome deeds produce no result.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When Mahāpajāpati became

Her disciples, who were in their sixties or seventies, were also of the same opinion as their mentor that it was time for them to depart.

Padumuttara conferred upon her the honour of pre-eminence, as the most senior in the service of the dispensation among all the bhikkhuṇīs. Gotamī Therī, then a minister’s daughter, considered the life of a Buddha’s mother as the noblest.

However, what is most to be rejoiced at is for 
you to have this opportunity to know and understand what is now being taught by the Buddha’s disciples. If insight knowledge is developed and the Path and Fruition are realised, one can at least be a Stream-winner. If one become a Once-returner, a Non-returner, or an Arahant, all the better.

Proficient in the destruction of the biases, she was a perfect <I>bhikkhunī.”</I></FONT><I></I></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In Praise of Nibbāna</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha uttered the following two verses: </FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Ayoghanahatasseva, jalato jātavedassa. <BR>Anupubbūpasantassa, yathā na ñāyate gati.” (v 286)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Evaṃ sammā vimuttānaṃ, kāmabandhoghatārinaṃ. <BR>Paññāpetuṃ gati natthi, pattānaṃ acalaṃ sukhaṃ.” (v 287)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verajja,sans-serif">“Just as 
there is no way of knowing where the sparks fly that flash as the sledge-hammer strikes, even so there is no way of knowing the destiny of Arahants as the floods of sensual desire are overcome and peace and tranquility firmly established.”</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As the blacksmith wields his sledge-hammer on the anvil, sparks flash for a brief moment and die out. There is no way of knowing where they go. 
The Arahants overcome the rushing tide of the floods of defilements such as sensual desire and the like. In the absence of attachment, actions, signs of actions, and signs of destiny fail to give rise to formation of sense-objects. With insight meditation decease-consciousness, appertaining to parinibbāna, casts off mind and matter which cease to flow with the realisation of the peace of nibbāna. All formative activities come to a stand still. So there is no way of knowing to which of the 
thirty-one planes of existence the Arahants go. In this analogy, the sparks are impermanent and unreal, and thus non-existent. Similarly, mind and matter, that made up the basis of life before parinibbāna, are impermanent, unreal, and non-existent.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those clinging to the idea of self, might put forward the proposition that the individuality of the Arahants has gone to nothingness, but it 
must be remembered that there is no individuality. What we commonly call an individual is nothing but a representation of the phenomenon of the rise and fall of aggregates. Depending on this phenomenon, attachment arises, but it is but a mass of suffering. When morality, concentration, and wisdom are correctly practised, the kind of weariness about which Gotamī Therī spoke will be developed. Then the fetter of attachment of mind and matter will be totally cut off. After the 
decease-consciousness of the Arahants, all substrata of existence are annihilated. This does not mean nothingness, but it does mean the reality of the total cessation of the cycle of suffering. When no new becoming arises on the cessation of suffering, aging, disease, death and all kinds of miseries that accompany it disappear altogether.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">One may ask if it will not be far better if we can go 
to heaven where there is no aging, disease, and death? However, this is just the apex of idealism. This kind of heaven exists only in imagination. Whatever arises gets dissolved. The abodes of devas and brahmas are heavens, but there you will find mind and matter that are constantly in a state of flux now arising, now passing away. So when their terms of existence expire, they also die!</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It 
is only when the extinction of mind and matter reveals to us the truth of suffering that real happiness can be found. By means of the path and its fruition, craving which is revealed to us as the cause of suffering can be exterminated. Then only will the aggregates cease to arise after the decease-consciousness relating to parinibbāna. When they come to cessation anupādisesa nibbāna is achieved.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"

The Buddha exhorted his disciples to practise mindfulness as prescribed in the Mahā Satipatthāna Sutta and to establish themselves in the domain of such contemplation. This is developing an island for them to live in, if these four modes of contemplation are practised they can aspire to the fulfilment of the seven requisites that can lead them to supreme knowledge, which paves the way to nibbāna.</FONT>
