 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A number of lectures by the late Venerable Mahāsī Sayādaw have been translated into English for the benefit of a wider audience. This book was reprinted in Malaysia, but this new edition has been completely revised for distribution in the UK. This second edition was reformatted and revised again in December 2006.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Venerable 
Sayādaw’s discourses were addressed to meditators practising intensively at Mahāsī Sāsana Yeikthā, in Rangoon. They therefore contain many Pāli words which, though familiar to those who have heard regular discourses, may not be so familiar to others. I have prepared this edition of the Mālukyaputta Sutta bearing in mind that it will be read by many who may be unfamiliar with Pāli terms. However, because parts of this discourse deal with the extremely subtle thought process <I>(citta vīthi)</I>, 
some Pāli technical terms used to explain the higher Buddhist philosophy <I>(Abhidhamma)</I> have been retained. The Pāli stanzas have also been retained for the enjoyment of those who do know some Pāli.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Because this Mālukyaputta Sutta deals with the extremely rapid mental events occurring when seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking, it is possible that non-meditators 
may not understand it. The best solution for those inexperienced in meditation would be to take up the practice of systematically noting all mental events at the six sense doors. If they practise meditation seriously for several days without a break, they will soon experience at least the momentary bliss of <I>tadanga-nibbāna,</I> as mentioned by the Venerable Sayādaw in this most excellent discourse. If they are very diligent, they might attain some insight knowledge, which would significantly improve the quality of their life, and ensure happiness in the future.</FONT>

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Mālukyaputta Sutta gives us the fundamental knowledge about the principles of insight meditation <I>(vipassanā).</I> It is found in the Samyuttanikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, and the twenty verses it contains can also be found in the Vīsatinipāta of the Theragāthā. It was given by the Buddha to Bhikkhu Mālukyaputta, at his request. He was the son of a female devotee by the name of Mālukyā, or Mālunkyā according to the Sri Lankan edition of the texts. His request to the Buddha was as follows:</FONT>
</P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Sādhu me bhante bhagavā samkhittena dhammam desetu, yamaham bhagavato dhammam sutvā eko vūpakattho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto vihareyyan”ti.</FONT></B></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Venerable sir, it would be good if you would teach me the Dhamma in brief. Having heard the essence of Dhamma, I will&nbsp; 
practise it in solitude, abiding vigilant, strenuous, and with single purpose.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In effect, Mālukyaputta was asking the Buddha to prescribe a subject of meditation, which he wanted to practise in the right way at a quiet place. Solitude is essential for meditation, as it is an aid to concentration, which may be disturbed if one lives with others. However, if one cannot get it, one 
should mind one’s own business while others mind theirs. In such circumstances one should not speak, nor even look at others to see what they are doing, focusing one’s mind fully on the Dhamma.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Vigilant"></A>Vigilant</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The word <I>‘appamatto’</I> in the text means ‘vigilant.’ This is also vital. In this meditation centre, the meditators are usually vigilant, never forgetting that they are striving for the realisation of the Dhamma. When they see an object, they note it with vigilance. When they hear, smell, taste, touch, or think, they are mindful of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, or thinking. The slightest action or movement does not go unnoticed or unobserved. They keep their minds alert, never allowing heedlessness to get the better of them.</FONT>
</P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Strenuous"></A>Strenuous</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The text also uses the word <I>‘ātāpī’</I> the root of which means to heat up. When one is enthusiastic, <I>ātāpī</I> may be said to be at work. Heat causes the evaporation of moisture. Enthusiasm causes the evaporation of all mental defilements <I>(kilesā),</I> as flies do not hover around a piece of red-hot iron. When enthusiasm is weak, defilements gain entry into the heart via the six sense-doors and torment ordinary people who fail to note the arising and passing away of all conditioned things. Defilements find no foothold in the mind of a vigilant meditator. In the texts, a defiled mind is compared to a wet, sappy stick. When meditation is practised with the utmost zeal and enthusiasm, defilements evaporate from one’s mind, leaving it absolutely dry and pure.</FONT>
</P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Four"></A>Four Right Exertions </FONT></H4><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">There are four kinds of right exertion <I>(sammappadhāna):</I></FONT></P><OL><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Exertion to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states. This 
preventative action is comparable to a health education campaign, which helps to ward off contagious diseases. As you are sure to encounter evil in your daily life, you must be wary of it, and take care to avoid contamination.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Second is the exertion to remove the unwholesome states that have arisen, and prevent them from recurring. We must strive to give up the inclination 
towards unwholesome things that we are predisposed to, otherwise they will overpower us eventually. Seeing, hearing, etc., stimulate the latent predispositions, which are the root causes of defilements.&nbsp; Such latent tendencies, which are stimulated by sense-objects, are called <I>‘arammanānusaya kilesā.’</I> When the meditator gains the path, all latent tendencies cease completely.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Third is the exertion to cultivate wholesome actions that have not yet arisen. Wholesome kamma should be acquired through the practice of charity, morality, and mental culture. I urge you especially to practise insight meditation if you have not done so yet. If you are doing it now to attain insight, continue until the path is attained.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Lastly is the exertion to develop arisen wholesome actions until the path is gained. A meditator normally acquires all four of these right exertions in the course of practice. </FONT></DIV></LI></OL><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Single"></A>With Single Purpose</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>‘Pahitatto’</I> is usually rendered as ‘with a mind dispatched to nibbāna.’ Taking it literally, some postulate that there is no need to practise meditation once one has dispatched the mind towards nibbāna. This is contrary to the teaching in the texts. What the word means is that one should exert in the practice regardless of life and limb, fixing one’s mind firmly on attaining the path, its fruition, and nibbāna. This agrees with the Commentary on the Sīlakkhandha Sutta, which deals with the subject of mental culture. </FONT>

Dhammapada Commentary relates the story of Anitthigandha Kumāra in whom love developed for the kind of feminine beauty that he had imagined. This illustrates that if one can visualize an image in one’s dreams or thoughts, then desire, lust, and affection can develop. The story is as follows:</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Anitthigandha Kumāra was born in Sāvatthi. He was a Brahmā in his previous existence. While in 
the Brahmā plane he was naturally free from the shackles of sensual desire and lust. When reborn as a human being, he had no interest in the opposite sex. When he came of age his parents urged him to marry, but he refused. As his parents were insistent he devised a plan by which he hoped to evade marriage. He enlisted the services of sculptors to make a gold image of a beautiful girl, and told his parents that he would marry anyone who looked like this gold image. The parents, being wealthy 
and capable, hired the services of brahmins to search the land for a bride whose beauty equalled that of the image that their son had conceptualised in the gold image.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the brahmins reached Sāgala in the Madda kingdom they heard talk of a beautiful sixteen year old girl who was kept secluded in a seven-storeyed tower. Having traced her, they persuaded her parents to allow them to assess 
her beauty. When she was brought to meet them they found that she was even more beautiful than the statue.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">They then negotiated with the parents for the girl to be given in marriage to Anitthigandha Kumāra. Gaining their consent, they informed the parents of the bridegroom. On hearing that the bride was even more beautiful than the figurine he had had sculpted, the bridegroom was anxious to 
have her brought as soon as possible. This is an instance of attachment that can arise purely out of one’s imagination.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sāgala and Sāvatthi are more than five hundred miles apart, and in those days transportation was primitive. Perhaps she was brought in a horse-drawn carriage. She became utterly exhausted during the journey, fell ill, and died.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When Anitthigandha Kumāra heard this news, he became gravely distressed for having missed the chance even to catch a glimpse of her. He could not eat or sleep. Knowing about this, the Buddha took pity on him, and so came to his house for alms. The parents respectfully offered alms to the Buddha and brought their son to meet him. Then the Buddha uttered the following verse:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1"

heard this verse the young man attained stream-winning. Previously he had been disinterested in women, and thought he had set his parents an impossible task.

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Mālukyaputta replied to the effect that no desire, lust, or affection could arise for sense-objects that one had never experienced, or even imagine. The meditators in this centre understand this, but others who have no experience in meditation may be puzzled. In 1951 I taught the Mālukyaputta Sutta in Thaddhamma Thitagu Yeikthā in Bassein, when the Thaddhamma Thitagu Sayādaw’s sister was among the audience. She 
confessed that she became confused when I mentioned the visible object that one had never seen or imagined. She wondered what sort of form that might be. She was intelligent, but her mind was unreceptive before she had practised insight meditation. After she had, she became convinced of the truth of the Dhamma. She was so pleased with the discourse that she disseminated the knowledge she gained from what had been taught to other devotees.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Every thoughtful person can accept that unseen objects cannot incite lust. Is it possible to conceive affection for an individual you have never met before? Not only affection, but hatred also cannot arise. Neither can delusion, nor wrong view. I have composed the following aphorism to aid your memory:</FONT></P><OL><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Where visible objects remain unseen, defilements cease automatically.</FONT>
</DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Where visible objects are seen, defilements lie in wait.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Note with mindfulness whatever is seen, and dispel defilements that lurk in the mind.</FONT></DIV></LI><LI><DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The question posed by the Buddha for Mālukyaputta forms the exercise for insight meditation.</FONT>
</DIV></LI></OL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It should now be clear that objects that one has never encountered cannot arouse the defilements of desire, lust, or affection. From this we can infer that defilements arise (only) from objects seen or known. The Buddha intended to draw Mālukyaputta’s attention to this fact by putting the question in that way, but he also wanted him to realise that defilements continue to arise 
whenever a sense-object is recalled. Having seen someone smiling or scowling, you may remember it. Every time that you do, the smiling or scowling face reappears. Each time your mind reacts to the mental impression that it creates. Similarly, when you recall things you have seen that incite lust, you become lustful. Anger and delusion are aroused in the same way. If you fail to note at each moment of seeing you tend to be unmindful of the impermanence and insubstantiality of conditioned 
things, then defilements invade your heart and remain. If you note every moment of seeing diligently, you will realise that it arises just to disappear. When its true nature of impermanence is known, it can no longer torment you.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">So whenever you look at anything, note what you see, mindful of its impermanence, giving no chance for defilements to develop. Defilements do not reside in you, but 
lie in wait for a chance to possess your mind. If you are mindful when noting the phenomenon of seeing, you will realise its transience, and it will subside. Your mind will then remain unperturbed, as if you had not perceived the object. This understanding will help you to practise insight meditation. That is why I say that the Buddha’s question reveals the exercise for insight meditation. Later you will hear more about the Buddha’s questions regarding sounds and the ear. Meanwhile I will 
give a brief account of the insight meditation exercises as instructed by the Buddha.</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Ettha ca te Mālukyaputta dittha suta muta viññātesu dhammesu ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati, sute sutamattam bhavissati, mute mutamattam bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattam bhavissati.”</FONT></B></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Mālukyaputta! As phenomena are seen, heard, thought of, or known, just let them be as they are seen, heard, thought of, or known at that moment.

denied any opportunity to arise when sense-objects cannot gain entry beyond the six sense-doors. The question then arises as to how to exert in repelling defilements when sense-objects do appear at the six sense-doors. Therefore the Buddha lays down the gist of the task of insight meditation in relation to the four modes of seeing, hearing, thinking, and knowing. Here we should note that the senses of smell, taste, and touch are included in the category of thought <I>(muta)</I>  for the sake of brevity. Meditation on the three characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self centres on these four modes of seeing, hearing, thinking, and knowing. These senses and sense-objects are not “I”, “Mine”, or “My self.” The objects just appear for a moment at the sense-doors and the meditator just sees or hears them for that moment, and nothing more. This is the essence of the insight meditation method.</FONT>

Let me begin by explaining the sequence of a thought-process that operates when a visible object presents itself to the eye-base through the eye-door. Several thought moments occur in sequence during each thought-process. First, when the eye-base receives the image of the visible object, life-continuum consciousness <I>(bhavanga)</I> wakes up and initiates the process of seeing in three thought-moments. This excites eye-door-adverting consciousness <I>(cakkhudvārāvajjana),</I> which turns towards the visible object. The image that falls on the eye-base is cognised by eye-consciousness <I>(cakkhuviññāna),</I> which at first remains unperturbed by defilements. It is followed immediately by receiving consciousness <I>(sampaticchana),</I> which receives or accepts the image. After that investigation <I>(santīrana)</I> takes over and investigates the object, so that determining <I>(votthapana)</I> can decide who is who, and what is what. Until now, latent defilement, which has been lying in wait for the opportunity to rear its head, has been unable to operate, but as soon as determining consciousness has decided that the object is agreeable or disagreeable, liking or disliking develop when the process of impulsion <I>(javana)</I> is brought into play. Impulsion normally runs its full course of seven thought-moments. At this stage action can be adjudged as moral or immoral, and defilements of greed, anger, or delusion now shows their true colours. Finally the two thought moments of registering <I>(tadārammana)</I> occur. This is a description of the thought-process of the mind on seeing an object. It is called <I>‘vīthi,’</I> the path or course that consciousness takes in establishing itself.</FONT>

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>Bhavanga</I> is a state of mind that works during sound sleep. (The closest English equivalent is life continuum, for it is an essential condition for continued existence). It does not turn itself towards sense-objects contacted in the present existence, but only towards a sense-object to which one was attached at the moment of death in the preceding existence.&nbsp; It is adjacent to relinking consciousness <I>(patisandhi citta)</I> of the present existence, which is the first moment of consciousness to arise at conception. It is assumed to be arising continuously, but, being passive, it subsides whenever thought moments of other varieties of consciousness emerge. For instance, when a sense-object enters the stream of consciousness through one of the six sense-doors, bhavanga is arrested to make room for sense-door consciousness <I>(dvārāvajjana),</I> which at once takes up the function of reflecting on the nature of the impression made by the sense-object that enters the sense-door. The eye-consciousness, or ear-consciousness, etc., occurs to be followed by receiving <I>(sampaticchana)</I> and investigating <I>(santīrana).</I> The result of this investigation is determining <I>(votthapana),</I> which decides who is who, or what is what. After this, impulsion <I>(javana)</I> vibrates for seven moments in an effort to deliver, as it were, the report of the decision to registering consciousness <I>(tadārammana),</I> which vibrates for two thought moments (when the thought process runs its full cycle). This subsides into <I>bhavanga,</I> which is compared to falling asleep.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When determining decides that an object is worthy of affection and love, immoral actions like lust and greed are aroused as desire for the object. This is the working of unwholesome impulsions. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes the object may be judged repugnant, but the subject may be inclined to do wholesome deeds to avoid the consequences of unpleasurable experiences. At other 
times a beautiful object may be viewed with compassion and benevolence when moral thoughts are brought into play. In such cases the impulsions are moral. It may be noted that there are fourteen thought moments from adverting to registering. If the sense-object makes a weak impression, the process of impulsion may end after only five or six moments, though it normally runs for seven.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When 
seeing occurs, just see it: don’t do anything more. As the text says, “On seeing, let seeing be.” The working of the thought process on hearing or tasting is the same as that of seeing. So when hearing occurs, just hear it. On hearing, let hearing be: do nothing more. This accords with the text: <I>“Sute sutamattam bhavissati.”</I> You will hear more about this later, but now I will deal with the abstract knowledge to be gained from noting visible objects.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT

 played their part in the process of seeing, the abstract reality of the form and shape of the sense-object (or sense impression) become manifest. Until now the subject who sees has not paid attention to concepts like masculinity or femininity. At this point, unwholesome impulsion may perhaps occur, but as it is weak it is unable to produce a strong reaction, so any result of unwholesome impulsion will not be too bad. Therefore,  at this initial stage when the reaction has not yet gathered momentum, you can note the object just as you see it. Next you will experience the abstract reality of both the subject that sees as well as the object that is seen. The subject is, of course, mind <I>(nāma)</I> and the object is matter <I>(rūpa).</I> So you have now come face to face with <I>nāmarūpa</I> as ultimate realities <I>(paramattha).</I> Still, you have not considered whether the object you are looking at is a man or a woman, which means you have not yet gained conceptual knowledge of the object seen. So at this stage, although you see something, you can leave it as it is, as you have not started thinking. This agrees with the statement, “When you see, just see it.”</FONT>

A beginner will not be able to catch the thought moments that make up the process of seeing. Being unable to stay with the phenomenon instantaneously as it arises, he or she has to 
consider the object appearing in the mind’s eye as if really wanting to know it. Whatever passes through the mind-door usually needs to be identified, but the beginner finds it difficult to adjust eye-consciousness to the object seen in his efforts to identify it, so has to rely on mind-consciousness to do some thinking regarding the visible object. The thought process relating to mind-consciousness is as follows. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">First mind-door adverting arises, prompting seven thought moments of impulsion that report the findings to two moments of registering. Thus there are ten thought moments in this part of the process. However, if the sense-object creates only a weak impression, impulsion vibrates for less than seven moments, and mind consciousness may be cut off after only five or six impulsions. When eye-consciousness has done its job, 
mind-consciousness takes over, but it is still unable to distinguish the visible object as male or female. At this stage knowledge is still at the stage of ultimate realities <I>(paramattha),</I> as with the preceding eye-consciousness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">However, note one difference here: whereas eye-consciousness cognises the visible object of the present moment, mind-consciousness cognises it as it recedes 
into the past. Mind-consciousness has to recall the past image as previously seen by eye-consciousness. Even so, the image is still an ultimate reality. It is, therefore, extremely difficult for the beginner to note the visible object as it passes to the first thought process of mind consciousness.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Conceptural"></A>The Birth of Conceptual Knowledge</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Failure to note the object with mindfulness as it enters the mind door at the first moment of mind-consciousness, prompts the arising of the second thought process. At this stage conceptual knowledge <I>(paññatti)</I> regarding the shape or form of the visible object begins to emerge, and it becomes firmly established at the third thought process. The subject is now able to distinguish the visible object as male or female. This clear cognition relates to both form and name, so concepts of name and form are conceived. This concept comes naturally in rapid succession during the second and third thought processes, but it is a concept gained through ignorance <I>(avijjā),</I> which conceals the true nature of the object. The commentaries say that ignorance has the tendency to hide. The basic exercise in mindfulness exhorts a meditator to observe and note every time he or she comes face to face with the realities, before ignorance creates the concept. At first, however, the meditator will find it difficult to apprehend the reality because mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom are not yet strong enough. When these qualities become firmly established, the meditator will be able to realise the true nature of things even at the lapse of the first thought process of eye-consciousness. When the meditator has attained knowledge of dissolution <I>(bhanga-ñāna)</I> and knowledge of equanimity with regard to formations <I>(sankhārupekkhā-ñāna),</I> he or she will find that it is not imperative for the stream of mind-consciousness to flow up to impulsion, and that after two or three moments of determining, he or she can realise insight relating to the sixfold equanimity towards all the senses of seeing, hearing, etc. This has been explained in the Commentary on the Mūlapannāsa; for more details please refer to my discourse on insight practice.</FONT>

Realising his shortcomings in the field of meditation, the elder visited a monastery where thirty Arahants lived in a forest and requested them to prescribe a meditation exercise for him. The senior Arahant knew about his pride of learning and refused to advise him, directing him to approach another monk. The other monks all did the same, until at last only a seven-year old novice, who was also an Arahant, remained.  The novice said that he was inexperienced, but Potthila insisted so the novice gave him this instruction:</FONT>

This gave the learned monk a clue to the method of insight practice. When one sees, one must stop at the thought moment of determining and note all phenomena with mindfulness.

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If we are mindful of the phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., according to the Buddha’s instructions, we may realise that they just occur, and that nothing can be done about it. The meditator need not go beyond seeing or hearing to examine what the object is, whether it is male or female, for example. The mind does not dwell on concepts, but stays with the ultimate realities <I>(paramattha).</I></FONT><I></I>

Some of them even suggest that the method of contemplation is wrong. While I was at Chauk, a man approached me with the criticism that 
eye-consciousness fails to recognise the genesis <I>(upāda)</I> and dissolution <I>(bhanga)</I> on the arising and passing away of mind and matter. It can recognise only the visible object that enters the eye-door, it cannot appreciate how the object is behaving. His criticism was along the following lines, “As eye-consciousness fails to see the visible object actually occurring, how can observation and noting it contribute to the knowledge of the genesis and dissolution of matter?”</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">According to the Commentaries and the Abhidhamma, matter <I>(rūpa)</I> comes into existence four or five thought moments before eye-consciousness and dissolves twelve, or at least nine or ten thought moments after its subsidence. It is, therefore, correct to say that eye-consciousness fails to notice the genesis and dissolution of the visible object at the moment of seeing. However, mindfulness has the ability to recall the genesis and dissolution of the actual phenomena perceived by eye-consciousness. According to the teaching in the Suttas, if the phenomenon is known by virtue of mindfulness, the genesis and dissolution of the sense-object can be cognised by eye-consciousness too.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Jhāna Sutta in the Anguttaranikāya mentions that when a meditator arises from absorption, he is able to recall the absorption consciousness, its concomitants, and the mental aggregate, which he meditated upon during absorption. He is clearly aware of them as if observing them with eye-consciousness. However, the genesis and dissolution of matter could not be perceived distinctly during 
absorption because he did not pay attention to it then. However, when jhānic consciousness, its concomitants, and the mental aggregate have been clearly understood, the nature of the matter that arises because of absorption can be understood by inference.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">So on the authority of that discourse, it may be shown that when one is noting the phenomenon of seeing, one is aware of the genesis and 
dissolution of the matter that forms the visible object, and that depends on eye-consciousness. When a meditator contemplates matter, he sees its arising and disappearance just like lightning. So it has been said:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Mental formations renew their appearance, and just as they are renewed they perish, just as a flash of lightning appears and disappears instantly.”</FONT></B></P></UL><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Consider a lightning flash. Who can honestly say that he can see its genesis and dissolution? Although one can see the entire phenomenon, one can see neither its beginning nor its end, but one does see it happen. To a meditator who possesses knowledge of dissolution and knowledge of equanimity with regard to formations, it is clear that the visible object makes its appearance, only to vanish at the next 
instant, just as lightning arises and disappears. This is even more evident in the case of sounds or tactile sensations. When one realises the three characteristics by direct knowledge of the arising and passing away of mind and matter, one may be sure that one has acquired insight knowledge.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Furthermore, if one continues to meditate in the way instructed, knowledge of disgust <I>(nibbidā-ñāna)</I> will develop. When one thus gets disenchanted with the aggregates, craving will be expelled, and with the absence of craving, the Noble Path can be attained, when one will become a Stream-winner.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Matter that is cognised by eye-consciousness arises simultaneously with passive subconsciousness <I>(atīta bhavanga)</I> inherited from the past. It dissolves simultaneously with the second thought-moment of registering during the formation of the thought process. However, it is not possible to be directly aware of genesis and dissolution. They can only be understood through applied knowledge <I>(sutamayapaññā).</I> Learning things at second-hand, however, may not contribute to the awakening of insight and the consequent realisation of knowledge of disgust <I>(nibbidā-ñāna).</I> No one can say precisely how matter arises, whether it is with the first, second, or third moment of subconsciousness, or when exactly it dissolves, whether with the second moment of registering or the seventh moment of impulsion. If insight knowledge were to require such precision regarding these thought processes, an ordinary meditator could not attain it. What the Abhidhamma Commentaries aim at is for the meditator to gain knowledge through applied methods when necessary. Such details do not matter in the practice of insight meditation. It is enough for the meditator to note the phenomenon as it arises in the same way that one notes the phenomenon of lightning. This agrees with the instruction: “Note that you go, when you go.”</FONT>

If one is constantly mindful, one will just hear what appears at the ear-door, and no more. As I am delivering this discourse, you are hearing each syllable 
that I am uttering. If you concentrate on each syllable that I pronounce, you will certainly miss the import and meaning of what I am trying to convey to you. If you stop short at cognition of the sounds that I make, you will not be able to note them in the conceptual way, which means you will not form any concept regarding what you hear. Likewise, when you smell an odour, you just know the odour. Consciousness will not flow any further than that. When you feel tactile sensations and stop 
short at that, you will just know that you have touched something or that something has touched you, and you will not go beyond that. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With the range of mental objects too, you will just stop short at the point where mind-consciousness arises without formulating concepts.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Let me remind you of the passage cited earlier regarding seeing, hearing, etc. “When you see, you just see it; when you hear, you just hear it; when you think, you just think it; and when you know, you just know it.” This is the practice of insight meditation in a nutshell. It means that when consciousness of sense-objects arises, you should note the arising so that the mind just stops there. You will not be able to do this 
unless you note the phenomenon with mindfulness. Even when you are trying to note in this way, your mind may deviate from its main objective to investigate the nature of the object, especially when you are just  beginning meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some assert that by merely investigating the three characteristics one can remain just with consciousness as it arises. Some go so far as to say that the mind 
should be just kept as it is, then it will automatically stop at cognition of things seen or heard. This amounts to saying that the mind should be left unrestrained without keeping guard over it. This means that mindfulness will be discarded. Let me ask such dissenters, “How will you react to harsh words that grind your ears, or to trash that inflames you, or to physical and mental pain that undermine your equanimity?” Without noting the psyche with mindfulness, how can anyone keep it as 
it is? Let these people judge for themselves the true worth of their own assertions.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When a meditator contemplates constantly on the phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., he or she will realise the knowledge of dissolution, which will reveal the moment when dissolution occurs. If the meditator abides in that moment, insight knowledge will be strengthened and its benefits will follow.</FONT></P>

You are completely free from the lust, anger, and delusion that those sense-objects usually arouse. When you fail to stop short at seeing, hearing, etc., your mind will cling to those passions, and whenever you recall those sense-objects they will again arouse lust, anger, and 
delusion. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Those who fail to note seeing, hearing, etc., get emotionally involved with the sights, sounds, etc., with which they come into contact. Those who have developed insight knowledge of dissolution through the practice of meditation realise the constant dissolution of both the sense-objects and the mind that knows them, and they are able to grasp the significance of the three 
characteristics. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Since sense-objects fail to generate defilements in the meditator, there is no reason for the meditator to recall them, and so defilements are discarded. The inclination to defilements caused by sense-objects is called ārammanānusaya.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Commentaries urge meditators to 
give unwholesome impulsions a wide berth. In fact, abandoning such impulsions come naturally to the diligent meditator, who requires no special effort to shun evil. When insight knowledge becomes keen, impulsions fail to arise because the stream of consciousness stops at determining. So the flow of consciousness subsides at determining, before impulsion begins to operate.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Buddha

go of craving and egoistic views, releasing himself from the ideas of “I”, “Mine”, or “My self,” he cannot get stuck in sense-objects. As the Buddha said, “Mālukyaputta” When you lose your foothold on the objects of sense, you will neither be here in this world, nor there in the other world, and not being anywhere in either world means the end of suffering.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When the ego 
has no foothold, mind and matter ceases to exist in all possible worlds, and this cessation means the end of suffering. This becomes apparent when the meditator’s mind gets inclined towards nibbāna through the realisation of the Noble Path. When an Arahant attains parinibbāna no vestige of mind or matter remains. As soon as death consciousness occurs at the time of parinibbāna, the Arahant achieves the extinction of suffering without remainder <I>(anupadisesa nibbāna).</I> Regarding this the Commentaries say that when a meditator loses his foothold on matter, he is neither here in the six organs of sense, nor there in the six sense-doors, nor anywhere in the six types of consciousness.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This agrees with the actual experience of the meditator who has gained knowledge of dissolution and knowledge of equanimity with regard to formations. No defilements can arise on realising the true nature of impermanent phenomena. Such a meditator takes a totally impersonal and objective view of the sights and sounds that he or she sees or hears. After that stage the attainment of adaptation 
knowledge <I>(anuloma-ñāna)</I> will prepare the meditator for the Noble Path, when he or she enters the stream of consciousness <I>(gotrabhū)</I> that raises him or her to the supramundane stage, overcoming the lineage of the sensual sphere.

At that moment you forget to practise the Dhamma. Even a meditator may be moved by pleasant visible objects, and attention may be diverted from his or her 
noble aim. Those unaccustomed to meditation practice, may easily give themselves away to alluring visible objects. As soon as the concept of beauty overpowers them, they will forget about the Dhamma. Form, therefore, makes one forgetful or unmindful.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A pleasing smile makes an impression on the heart of one who sees it, and it is always a pleasure to recall it. One remembers it for days, 
months, or years. The mind is then taking in the form as if trying to ingest or imbibe it.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Here, I am speaking about the reaction to forms in general terms. Of course, there are occasions when one feels repugnant towards the object one sees. At other times, one may be indifferent. Whatever the case may be, the crux of the matter is that form generates various kinds of feelings such as pain, 
pleasure, greed, or anger, which give rise to kamma and its results as the round of suffering. Suffering as the result of forms is shown by the next stanza:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Tassa vaddhanti vedanā, anekā rūpasambhavā; Abhijjhā ca vihesā ca, cittamassūpahaññati.

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“A multitude of passions such as covetousness and rage, springing from form, torments one who takes a firm hold of it, with the result that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Therefore, nibbāna remains remote from one who would rather carry the burden of suffering than practise meditation.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">All forms gives rise to 
feelings or passions. When an agreeable object is presented to anyone, he or she delights in it, which is pleasant feeling. When a repugnant object is presented, he or she feels miserable, which is unpleasant feeling. Such feelings are the cause of vexation, which torment him or her. If one sees a beautiful object, desire to possess it arises. One will get annoyed if one thinks that someone is thwarting one’s wishes to acquire it. Such mental dispositions are the product of greed and anger. 
They worry the unmindful person, who is forever busily engaged in malevolent activities against those who obstruct the fulfilment of his or her desires. Spurred on by greed and anger, he becomes exhausted in his or her efforts to counter the opposition of rivals and adversaries, whether real or imaginary.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Most people live without mindfulness throughout their lives.

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This stanza reveals the essence of insight meditation. It enjoins the meditator to note with mindfulness the object seen, and meditate on it. From this it is clear that insight meditation means noting the object one has actually seen, not an object one has not seen. It can be accomplished only through practical wisdom, and not through knowledge acquired from hearing what others say.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Commentaries on the Theragāthā say that a meditator must try to note the eye-object perceived as it presents itself to eye-consciousness through the eye-door, being mindful of the four aspects of clear comprehension: knowing what is beneficial, what is proper, what is the objective, and with unconfused mindfulness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Earlier 
I told you about the thought process relating to eye-consciousness. What I am talking about now is the same thing. If you fail to note the process of seeing just as it occurs, try to catch the first thought moment of mind-consciousness. One who can seize that moment and notice the absolute reality of form, may notice the dissolution of both the sense-object and the eye-consciousness at the moment of seeing. When one concentrates on the act of seeing without thinking over what one has seen, 
visual perception will last only for an instant. This agrees with the saying, “Ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati.”  In that case, defilements will have no chance to assert themselves. In the absence of defilements, lust and craving subside.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Desire stimulates feelings and passions, which beget craving <I>(tanhā),</I> by means of which one imbibes form. A non-meditator, although fully aware of seeing the object, fails to note it with mindfulness, and so permits craving to arise. However, a meditator does not conceptualise about what is seen, so there is no chance for desire or craving to arise, for the meditator is always mindful of dissolution. In this case, delusion is eliminated and wisdom arises. In the absence of defilements such as craving, kamma and its results as new becoming cannot arise, so the meditator will be liberated from suffering. This is emphasized in the next stanza:</FONT>

suffering ceases.

Theragāthā emphasise that “seeing the form” means seeing it with the strength of conviction that what one sees is impermanent. Eye-consciousness brings about sensations of seeing, which mind-consciousness takes to heart. The mind collects them and stores them up in the same way that a greedy person amasses wealth. The result is the upsurge of covetousness, one of the defilements on which kamma and its results depends. A meditator refuses to accept eye-consciousness and its consequences 
in this way. In other words a meditator abstains from imbibing defilements that lead to the round of suffering. Each time one meditates on the phenomenon of seeing, insight knowledge is developed. Each time insight knowledge is developed, defilements are discarded. So one is said to be enjoying tadanga nibbāna - momentary bliss obtained at the moment that defilements are discarded.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A meditator who is dwelling with the realities <I>(paramattha),</I> will gradually realise the insight knowledges stage by stage. He or she will proceed from analytical knowledge of mind and matter <I>(nāmarūpa-pariccheda-ñāna)</I> to knowledge of change of lineage <I>(gotrabhū-ñāna)</I> through adaptation knowledge <I>(anuloma-ñāna).</I> According to the sayings in the Patthāna, this will ultimately lead one to the Path and its Fruition. It should be noted that adaptation knowledge is the highest of the ten stages of insight knowledge. Aspirants to nibbāna must, therefore, engage themselves in insight meditation.</FONT>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As an object makes a sound, the ear just hears it. If you note this with mindfulness, without going beyond the hearing, you call a halt to the process of hearing. The stream of consciousness stops flowing there and then. However, if you are unmindful, mental formations and activities will be brought into play. You may remember the sound that you hear and think over it. That means that the stream 
of mind-consciousness has taken over. Even then, the process of mind-consciousness is only aware of the sound, and concept has not yet been formed. If you can note this with mindfulness, apperception ends here, stopping at the stage of the abstract idea of the sound. If you fail to interrupt further mental activities, the next process of mind-consciousness will interpret the concept of the individual making the sound, and the next process will distinguish the sex of the individual. This will 
be followed by the development of affinity or repulsion. This is how the thought process stirs up defilements. So it is imperative to meditate on hearing just as you hear.

Ordinary lay people are quite unaware of this meditation practice. Even learned persons do not pay 
heed to it, assuming that as one gets the flavour of food as it is taken, there is no need to note it with mindfulness. This amounts to irreverence to the teachings of insight meditation. Others go so far as to say that meditating on taste is a sheer waste of time. Eating, they say, should be done quickly so that more time can be devoted to meditation.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The majority of meditators are guilty 
of unmindfulness in eating. Once they fail to note the flavour as they take food, they lose mindfulness and become attached to it. That means they cherish the desire, and enjoy the pleasure of eating.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">All food and comestibles are prepared to be delicious. When lay people offer food to the monks, they take special care to make the food appealing to the palate. This shows how much importance 
people give to flavour. I remember an observation made by a Sayādaw in Moulmein. He once taught one of his devotees that it was usual for monks to partake of food with mindfulness that disregards the flavour, as if what is delicious was repugnant. This drew a protest from the devotee who said, “Venerable sir! It is most improper that you should view the delicious dishes that I have prepared for you enjoyment as repugnant.” It was quite logical for him to say so, because food for the 
monks is usually prepared by donors so that the recipients could eat them with relish. Here, the preparation of delicious food is the responsibility of the donor, but monks should contemplate all food as repugnant so that defilements cannot overwhelm them.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The monastic training requires that monks eat, reflecting wisely. Unlike lay people, monks should take food, not for enjoyment, nor for 
indulgence, nor for physical development, nor for fattening, but just to maintain the body, for supporting the holy life, to quench the pains of hunger and thirst, so that they can effectively pursue the practice of meditation. If one can practise meditation on the repulsiveness of food <I>(āhāre patikkūlasaññā),</I> it is all the more commendable. Regarding this please see the Visuddhimagga [Vism. 341]. However, for our purposes it will be best to follow the method of <I>Satipatthāna.</I></FONT>

The result is trouble for everyone. All these troubles stem from the development of desire and attachment due to failing

I will give you an example to show how to meditate on it.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When a monk sits before a table and sees the food, he notes the phenomenon of seeing. As he raises his hand to pick up the food, he notes the raising of the hand. As he takes a morsel of food in his hand, he notes that he is taking it. As he 
brings it towards his mouth, he notes that he is bringing it. As it touches his mouth, he notes the touching. As he opens his mouth, puts the food in, closes his mouth, brings his hand down, touches the plate with his hand, and meanwhile chews the food, he notes each of these actions. As his hands move and he chews the food, he is conscious of the element of motion operating. If his hand touches hot food, he is aware of the element of heat. When he tastes sweet or sour on the tongue, he notes 
the flavour. As he is thus noting all the phenomena connecting with eating or tasting, he dispels desire for food, and eventually all lust for it. When his concentration gets stronger, he knows the flavour only as flavour and nothing more. It does not occur to him that a particular dish of chicken curry is delicious. It means that he has abandoned the pleasurable object of taste, and thus he eradicates defilements.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The experience of meditators at Mahāsī Yeikthā bears this out. When a meditator eats, he becomes conscious of the fragrant smell and sweet taste that the food generates. However, as soon as he comes to know the phenomena of smell, taste, and the nose and tongue-consciousness, and the mind that notes this, they dissolve away. Under these circumstances, lust has no chance to assert itself, for the meditator cognises flavour just as 
flavour and nothing more. Some meditators say as they were noting the phenomenon of tasting, they failed to recognise what kind of food they had been given. This is quite possible. For, in the absence of desire and attachment, no pleasure can be derived from the food taken. Where there is no attachment, one does not take a firm hold of feeling, as if one is going to devour it.</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Yathāssa sāyarato rasam, sevato cāpi vedanam;

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">A meditator eats and tastes the food just like anyone else, but does not indulge in the flavour, so does not commit wholesome or unwholesome deeds in relation to the flavour. It means that tasting cannot lead to kamma formations and their results. Without them no new becoming can arise, and there will be an end to the round of suffering.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The doctrine of dependent origination says, <I>“Vedanā paccayā tanhā</I> - feeling begets craving.” However, as no craving arises when the feeling has subsided, clinging does not result, and defilements, kamma and its results become inoperative. Since the causes of suffering are eliminated, a meditator who is steadfast in the practice of insight meditation, attains momentary bliss <I>(tadanga nibbāna),</I> when peace is established for the duration of the elimination of defilements. This can eventually lead to the fulfilment of the Noble Path and its Fruition.</FONT>

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“What do you think, Mālukyaputta? There are certain tangible objects that you have never touched before, that you are not touching now, and do not hope to touch in the future. Could such objects arouse desire, lust, or affection in you?”</FONT></B></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Mālukyaputta replied in the negative, which is right. Here again it may be 
stressed that no defilements can arise for sense-objects with which one is unfamiliar. Indigenous peoples develop no desire for foreign fashions, which they have never even seen before. The same analogy applies to friendship — one never makes friends with people whom one has never met or seen before.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">For most of us, seeing or hearing is intermittent. We are not seeing or hearing things all 
the time. Since we are not always eating, tasting is even less frequent. Tactile sensations, however, occur all the time. They are far more pervasive than other sensations. They may be felt even when one is sitting or standing still, or eating and drinking. So we are involved with sensations of touch day in and day out. Meditators usually have to meditate more on objects of touch than on any other objects.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The text says, <I>“Gacchanto vā gacchāmī’ti pajānāti</I> - know that you are going, when you go.” When you note the walking, lifting the foot, pushing it forward, and putting it down, you are conscious of the entire movement connected with the process of walking. This means that knowledge of walking arises. So you should let that knowledge remain as it is according to the instruction, <I>“Mute mutamattam bhavissati</I> - when you know, just know it.” Do not go further than that. This meditation technique is mostly on the activities of the element of motion, though at times the element of heat, or the element of hardness may also be prominent. Mostly though, one must concentrate on the element of motion.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The text goes on to say, <I>“Thito vā thitomhī’ti pajānāti; nisinno vā nisinnomhī’ti pajānāti</I> - know that you are standing when you stand, know that you are sitting when you sit. Here too, you are instructed to note the nature of the element of motion. If you are not satisfied with this method, note the activity of the element of motion by watching the rise and fall of the abdomen as you are standing, sitting, or lying down.</FONT>

It is concentration on breathing in and breathing out. Breathing is an act of the element of motion. It may be asked, therefore, “Why not take up the exercise of breathing in and out?” In my opinion, I agree that <I>ānāpāna</I> could lead to the establishment of insight knowledge, but it should be noted that the Visuddhimagga puts it in the category of meditation objects for tranquillity as opposed to insight. It enumerates the fourteen body contemplations as follows:</FONT>
</P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“Herein, the three, that is to say, the sections on the four postures, on the four kinds of full awareness, and on attention directed to the elements as they are stated [at M.iii.89] deal with insight. ... So there are only two, that is the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness that, as stated there, deal with concentration.” (Vism. 240)</FONT></B></P></UL><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Thus it is clearly stated that mindfulness of breathing belongs to the development of concentration. Therefore, if we advocated mindfulness of breathing we would be open to the criticism that we were teaching <I>samatha</I> and not <I>vipassanā.</I> Then we would be unable to make a rebuttal of this charge without contradicting this teaching in the Visuddhimagga. However, we allow those who like to practise mindfulness of the respiration to have their wish. We impose no restriction upon them.</FONT>

The purpose is to enable the meditator to develop access concentration <I>(upacāra samādhi)</I> and attainment concentration <I>(appanā samādhi)</I> to enter jhāna. </FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In the practice of insight, there is no restriction that directs the meditator to note only one phenomenon continuously. If we instruct the meditators to note all the phenomena of touch that occur in various parts of the body while breathing in and out, we will again be open to the criticism that we are contradicting the two authorities just cited. That is why we do not encourage meditators to 
practise mindfulness of respiration for insight meditation.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Abdomen"></A>Meditation on Abdominal Movements</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It has been asked whether meditation on the rising and falling of the abdomen really conforms to the Pāli texts. This question may be answered on the authority of the 
Salāyatana Vagga of the Samyuttanikāya where it is stated that failure to note the arising and passing away of mind and matter occurring at the six sense-doors results in the upsurge of defilements, while meditating on them brings nibbāna closer through the realisation of the Path and Fruition with the suppression of defilements. The Mālukyaputta Sutta is also very clear on this point. I shall give reasons in support of our method conforming to the scriptures.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When <I>Satipatthāna</I> teaching prescribes observing the four elements, it is advocating the observance of the apparent phenomena created by the four primary elements.

Employing everyday language agrees with the Buddha’s preference for simple speech when he gave the advice, <I>“Gacchāmi vā gacchāmi’ti pajānāti.”</I> As the meditator’s concentration develops with continued practice of insight meditation, he or she will come to realise the nature of the element of motion in the movements of the abdomen.</FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">On the authority of the Satipatthāna Sutta, and others in the Samyuttanikāya, we take it that a meditator should concentrate not only on the four postures usually mentioned in the scriptures, but also on other postures or actions that can be met with in the normal course of events.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">If a 
meditator does not feel satisfied with noting the rising and falling of the abdomen, he or she can try meditating on sitting while sitting, on standing while standing, or on lying down while lying down. However, we do not urge meditators to practise mindfulness of respiration as we maintain that it contradicts statements in the Visuddhimagga and Commentaries on the Satipatthāna Sutta, which speak of insight meditation after the attainment to absorption through noting breathing in and 
breathing out, but we do not deter anyone from practising mindfulness of respiration.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Now I will revert to my original theme.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="FailContact"></A>Failure to Meditate on Contact While Touching</FONT></H4><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B><FONT SIZE="-1"

 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Tactile sensations arise everywhere in the body. When a living body touches an inanimate object, sensations arise. When the limbs touch one another, the same happens. These are external sensations. There are also internal sensations, which often pass unnoticed. For instance, we are usually unaware of the fact that blood comes into contact with muscular tissues embedded in the body. Those unaccustomed to mindfulness cannot take full 
note of the external sensations, let alone the internal ones. So when you practise meditation casually, you are liable to be forgetful of the Dhamma, and will be aware of beauty when you see it. It is natural to hanker after pleasurable sense-objects; and when they are found you forget to note the arising and passing away of the aggregates. At times you may feel repugnant to disagreeable sights that you see or disturbing sounds that you hear. This also makes you forgetful of the Dhamma.</FONT>

Even when doing their daily exercise routine for health they are doing so delighting in the thought that it will contribute to sensual enjoyment and 
beauty. All these delights and pleasures are the product of their surroundings, which worship the five constituents of the senses. They generate defilements.

You should note this also. You should note every physical action: bending or stretching your arms or legs, tilting your head backwards or forwards, opening or shutting your eyes, or blinking. As you dress, wash, or take a shower, there may be many kinds of movements. Even when you urinate or evacuate your bowels, you must not forget to note the manifestation of the element of motion.
