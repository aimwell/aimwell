</TR></TABLE><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Sloth and Torpor (21)</FONT></H2><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Pāli books describe <I>“thina”</I> as the torpor of the mind and <I>“middha”</I> as the torpor of mental factors <I>(cetasika).</I> However, cetasika is not a common word in Burmese, so we will translate <I>thinamiddha</I> as 
mental torpor. Since mental factors are always connected with consciousness <I>(citta)</I> the torpor of consciousness inevitably means torpor of mental factors. Mental torpor means a decline in energy, or laziness. For the meditator, low energy and a dull, sluggish mind are obstacles to the development of concentration. Hence sloth and torpor is described as a hindrance <I>(nīvarana).</I> The meditator must first 
get free from the hindrances and make the mind pure. The hindrances should be overcome by means of attainment or access concentration.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Satipatthāna Sutta contains two parts, the first dealing with tranquillity and the second with insight. Practice of in-and-out breathing and contemplation on impurity, as described in the first part, 
lead to the attainment of absorption. The section on in-and-out breathing says:</FONT></P><UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">“The meditator breathes in <I>(assasati)</I> attentively; he breathes out <I>(passasati)</I> attentively.”</FONT></P></UL><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>Assāsa</I> is translated as exhaled air and passāsa as inhaled air in secular treatises and dictionaries. 
However, in the Patisambhidāmagga, which sets forth the course of training in the holy life, <I>assāsa</I> and <I>passāsa</I> are described as inhaled air and exhaled air respectively. This interpretation is more reasonable in practice, because if you fix your mind on the nostril in the practice of breathing, the inhaled air is first apparent. It also fits in with the Pāli term <I>“ānāpāna.” “Ānā”</I> means inhaled air while <I>“pāna”</I> means 
exhaled air, so I have translated “passasati” as breathe out.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In breathing in and out the meditator should do so mindfully. According to the Commentary, if contact with the in and out breath is apparent at the nostril or the upper lip, the meditator should note the point of contact. He must ignore the air that is breathed into the body or the air that is breathed out. 
He must note “in, in,” and “out, out” The Commentary suggests that the beginner should practise by counting, “one, two, three,” etc. However, what matters most is the development of concentration through the practice. It will do just as well if the meditator notes mindfully “in, in,” “out, out,” whenever he breathes. Through such practice he will be free from sensual desire and other hindrances 
and attain access concentration and the four absorptions. This is the way to cultivate mental purity according to the section on mindfulness of respiration in the Satipatthāna Sutta.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Then as regards contemplation on impurity, the meditator should reflect on the thirty-two parts of the body such as hair, bones, heart, liver, lung, intestines, urine, saliva, etc. This contemplation will free 
him from hindrances and ensure access concentration and the first absorption. This is the way to achieve purity of mind through contemplation on impurities.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Purification"></A>Mental Purification Through Insight</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The other nineteen sections are described as those relating to insight meditation and access 
concentration. The meditator notes that he walks when he walks, that he stands when he stands, that he lifts his foot when he lifts it, and so forth. In brief, he notes and notes all kinds of bodily movement. </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">He must also have clear comprehension <I>(sampajañña).</I> He must have clear comprehension in looking 
straight, on looking sideways, in bending or stretching the legs or hands, in holding the robes or alms-bowl, in eating, in drinking, and even when urinating and defecating.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When he walks, stands, sits, falls asleep, wakes up, speaks, or keeps silence, he must do these things consciously. In brief, every activity of the body must be governed by consciousness. There is no bodily 
activity that we should not note or that should not be the object of our consciousness. We should also note and make ourselves aware of the air-element or the element of stiffness and motion as manifested in the rising and falling of the abdomen.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator should also contemplate the three kinds of feelings: pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling, 
and neutral feeling. This may be expanded to nine kinds of feelings. The meditator should know and note all of these feelings.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As regards the mindfulness of consciousness <I>(cittānupassanā)</I> the meditator is instructed to attend to and know every state of consciousness that occurs as it is, whether it is greedy or not and so on.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As for the mindfulness of the mind-objects <I>(dhammānupassanā)</I> there are five subjects for practice. The meditator should know the kind of hindrance that he has whether it is sensual desire or not, etc. He must know the five aggregates: matter, feeling, perception, mental-formations and consciousness. He should know the twelve sense faculties such as the eye and visual objects, etc. When the 
meditators of today note and become mindful of their seeing, hearing, and so forth, they are practising the Satipatthāna method, and their practice conforms to the section of the sutta on the sense faculties.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator is also instructed to know the seven factors of enlightenment <I>(bojjhanga).</I> This accords 
with the experience of the meditators when they have special illuminations following the development of insight-knowledge such as knowledge of arising and passing away. The meditator should also know the Four Noble Truths. According to the Commentary, we should distinguish between two mundane truths — the truth about suffering and the truth about the cause of suffering. When the meditator notes the desire and attachment that arise, he is aware of the truth about the cause of suffering. He 
also knows it after reflection. Noting everything that arises on the basis of the abdominal rising and falling is to practise the four kinds of mindfulness in accordance with the teaching of the Satipatthāna Sutta. Each of the four methods of contemplation is especially suitable for some meditators. The meditators will attain the noble path and its fruition through any method that suits them best.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">We advise the meditator to note everything starting with the rising and falling. While noting in this way, the meditator is likely to be distracted by habitual thoughts, which are primarily the hindrance of sensual desire. Such thoughts should be noted and rejected. We become angry in the face of an unpleasant object. This is the hindrance of ill-will that has to be noted and rejected.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditators who practise meditation are at first motivated by strong faith, will, and energy. However, when insight-knowledge does not develop, some meditators lose heart and slacken their efforts. This is the hindrance of torpor, which must be removed through constant mindfulness. If noting is not helpful, the meditator should reflect on the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, on the 
dangers of samsāra, and the benefits of insight. Those who do not know how to reflect should consult their teacher and listen to suitable discourses. Listening to discourses tends to dispel laziness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><I>“Thinamiddha”</I> is also translated as drowsiness. Drowsiness may be due to torpor or to physical 
exhaustion. While noting, the meditator may lose energy, become slothful, and his perceptions gradually become dull. If he or she cannot overcome sloth by noting, he or she becomes drowsy and falls asleep. Even the chief disciple Moggallāna was overcome with torpor while meditating before he became an Arahant. The Buddha instructed his disciples to dispel torpor by fixing the mind on light, washing one’s face, and so forth.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Drowsiness"></A>Drowsiness is Not Always A Defilement</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Drowsiness through exhaustion of the physical body may occur in the Arahant who has no defilements. When Saccaka, the wandering ascetic asked the Buddha whether he ever slept in the daytime, the 
Buddha replied that he slept during the day in the last month of summer. Saccaka said that sleeping in the daytime was regarded by some people as a form of delusion <I>(sammoha).</I> Although he thus referred to the views of some people, he was in fact implying that the Buddha was not free from delusion. The Buddha then said that sleeping was neither delusion nor non-delusion, that one who is not free from 
biases and defilements may be in delusion, that the Buddha who was free from defilements was never in delusion. Since even the Buddha slept, this shows that the desire to sleep because of physical exhaustion is not to be described as torpor, nor as a hindrance.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Torpor"></A>Physical Torpor</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The Vimuttimagga, “The path of Liberation,” mentions three kinds of torpor according to their causes — psychological factors, hot weather, and excess of food. It says that only the psychosomatic torpor is a hindrance or defilement, other kinds of torpor cannot be so described because even the Arahants are not free from them. This view is repudiated in the Visuddhimagga and the Commentary on the 
Atthasālinī. However, physical torpor due to climate and food is also mentioned in the Milindapañha, “The Debate of King Milinda,” and the Petakopadesa. Thus the theory of physical torpor was advanced by three ancient Indian books and rejected by the Sinhalese Commentaries. We should, therefore, assume that the physical origin of torpor was accepted by Indian bhikkhus. The theory is reasonable because it is said that even the Buddha slept during the day when it was very hot.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The term <I>“thinamiddha”</I> is thus restricted to the laziness, drowsiness, or lethargy that beset us in doing wholesome deeds, or in the practice of meditation. It is sloth and torpor if it laziness that prevents you from listening to a discourse or from meditating on the Buddha. Such sloth and torpor 
should be rejected after due reflection. In particular, laziness, low energy, or drowsiness while you are noting the sense-objects in meditation means sloth and torpor. This should be noted and dispelled. True to the teaching of the Buddha in the Sallekha Sutta, the meditator should affirm his or her will to overcome sloth and torpor.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">He or she should note vigilantly and focus the mind on the contact between consciousness and the 
object that is noted. In this way, before long he or she will attain concentration. Concentration means insight because, when the mind is concentrated, it is fixed on the object of attention. There is no lethargy, no hindrance. The noting mind is pure and this is purity of mind. Just as when you look in the darkness at night you see nothing clearly, but when you switch on your flashlight, all the objects that 
are within the focus of the light become clearly visible. Concentration is like an electric light. All the phenomena on which you concentrate your mind become clear.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When you note the rising and falling, you become clearly aware of the rising, falling, and stiffness of the abdomen. The same may be said of the bending, stretching, and lifting of your limbs. The meditator 
knows stiffness and motion clearly; every unit of the noting consciousness is also clearly perceived as if it were moving towards the object of attention. Thus insight into the distinction between mind and matter arises, and the pairwise occurrence of the mind that knows and the matter that is known.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">I will talk more of the relation between concentration and insight later. For the moment I stress the 
need to overcoming sloth and torpor through intensive mindfulness.</FONT></P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Restlessness"></A>Restlessness (22)</FONT></H2><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Restlessness <I>(uddhacca)</I> is mind-wandering or the straying of the mind away from the object that is to 
be noted. This is so well-known that it needs no elaboration. While noting the rising and falling of the abdomen, the body postures, etc., the mind tends to wander to vague, indefinite objects. These thought-objects are apparently not objects of desire, irritation, or doubt. Sometimes the thoughts seem to slip away in spite of all the special attention paid to the object. Occasionally the mind wavers 
between this and that way of noting, becoming distracted and restless. This restlessness is due to too much zeal. The meditator should relax, take it easy, and note more steadily. More often than not, restlessness is due to weak concentration. To avoid it the meditator should take special care to fix the mind on the object of attention.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Noting should be done with special care just as one exercises great care to prevent a fragile object 
slipping from the hand. The Commentary says that some people are not tranquil even for a few seconds, their minds are always wandering. They do not try to keep their minds stable even for a moment nor do they know that it is worthwhile to do so. The Buddha urged his disciples to overcome restlessness by fixing their mind on the object of attention instead of allowing it to wander restlessly.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">At the beginning, the meditator should focus on the rising of the abdomen from the beginning to the 
end. The same may be said of noting the falling, or the sitting, lifting, and moving forward of the feet. If the meditator thus keeps on noting carefully, he or she will develop concentration and find that the mind falls right on the object of attention. Just as, for example, when you throw a heavy rice bag off your shoulder, it stays where it falls instead of rolling away, or just as when you plunge a spear or a pointed stick into soft ground, it stays stuck wherever it falls.</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">With the development of concentration, the mind is focused on the object and is no longer restless, but becomes pure. This purity of mind is free from restlessness and other hindrances. Mental purity leads to insight that discriminates between mind and matter.</FONT></P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Doubt"></A>Doubt (23)</FONT>
</H2><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Doubt <I>(vicikicchā)</I> is skepticism about the Buddha, his teaching, the Sangha and the practice of morality, concentration, and wisdom. All these four kinds of skepticism are implicit in the skepticism about the true Dhamma. For one who has doubt about the true Dhamma will also have doubt about the 
Buddha who taught it, about the members of the Sangha who practise it, and about the way of life that conforms to it. Hence our translation of vicikicchā as doubt about the true Dhamma. Also implicit in the doubt about the true Dhamma are doubts about past lives, doubts about future lives, doubts about the relationship of the present to past and future, and doubts about the relationship between cause and effect (Dependent Origination). The past, present, and future lives of samsāra are 
connected to the true Dhamma.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Thus doubt about the true Dhamma means all the eight kinds of doubt that we have mentioned. It does not include doubts that have nothing to do with the true Dhamma, doubts such as whether this road will lead to the pagoda, whether this business is likely to be lucrative, and so forth. Such doubt in 
worldly affairs is not a hindrance. Only the eightfold doubt about the Dhamma is the hindrance of doubt.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Tranquility"></A>Doubt About Tranquility Meditation</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator who devotes himself to tranquillity meditation may have doubts about that practice. 
Could this meditation on breathing lead to the attainment of absorption? Would it be possible to attain the four absorptions merely by meditating on the earth-kasina? Would such absorptions lead to attainment of psychic powers? Is it a fact that such powers enable a man to create things, to go underground, to fly in the air, to see or hear everything? Would noting and reflecting on the thirty-two parts of the body ensure the attainment of absorptions? These are doubts that pose a hindrance to 
the development of tranquillity.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Insight"></A>Doubt About Insight Meditation</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Could mindfulness of the bodily activities of standing, sitting, walking, etc., by itself develop insight 
into the distinction between mind and matter? Is it possible for a meditator to gain insight-knowledge simply by noting every phenomenon that arises from the six senses, such as the arising and falling of the abdomen? These are instances of doubt that form a hindrance to the progress in the practice of insight.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator who harbours such doubts is like a traveller at a crossroads. If he is travelling in 
unfamiliar territory, he should ask those who have travelled there before. He must travel fast if he is being followed by enemies. Suppose he stops at a crossroads and wavers without taking one way or the other. He will then be overtaken, looted and killed by the pursuing enemies. His suffering is due to his hesitation at the crossroads.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Likewise, the meditator who has doubts is hampered in his effort to practise mindfulness. He is at the 
crossroads. Because he hesitates inattentively, he does not know the sense-objects as they really are. Because of his ignorance, he clings to them as if they were permanent, pleasant, and substantial. Clinging causes greed, hatred, and other defilements as well as wholesome and unwholesome kamma that lead to the lower realms and other suffering such as birth. Thus the doubting meditator suffers just as the hesitating traveller at the crossroads suffers at the hands of his enemy.</FONT></P><P
 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">It is imperative to dispel doubts about the true Dhamma. Because of skepticism, some cannot practise meditation; some do not listen to discourses, and some do not care to read books on meditation. They miss opportunities because they confuse doubt with an inquiring mind.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Confusion"></A>Cause of Confusion</FONT>
</H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some people do not appreciate meditation since they do not take the Satipatthāna Sutta seriously. The Buddha’s teaching is simple and straightforward, but they mix it up with the teaching of the Abhidhamma and Commentaries — hence their confusion. The Buddha said, “Be mindful of your physical body … <I>Kāye kāyanupassi vihārati,”</I> which means that the meditator should focus his mind on the parts 
of the body and its activities. Meditation on the parts of the body is described fully in the method of contemplating the thirty-two parts such as hair. Contemplating hair, and so forth, as loathsome objects is undoubtedly the practice of mindfulness of the body. Again meditation on the activities of the body is described in the words, “The meditator knows that he walks when he walks … Gacchanto 
vā gacchāmī’ti pajānāti.” The text tells us plainly to be mindful of walking when we walk, of standing when we stand, of sitting when we sit and so on. If we do not note this activity of the body at the moment of it’s arising, we tend to regard it as permanent, pleasant, and substantial. However, noting all kinds of activity makes us aware of the three characteristics, and this awareness in turn makes one 
free from attachment. Hence the Buddha’s insistence on the need for mindfulness at every moment. Here the bodily activity that is the object of attention includes the abdominal rising and falling.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Tenseness and motion at the moment of rising and falling form wind-body <I>(vāyokāya),</I> noting and knowing means <I>“anupassanā”</I> and so to note and know the rising and falling is <I>kāyānupassanā.</I></FONT><I></I>

The physical body is impermanent, painful, repulsive, and lacking in any ego-entity. One should contemplate to realise these 
unpleasant facts of life. To this end one must first know the nature of the physical body. This calls for noting all forms of bodily activity at the moment of their occurrence.</FONT></P><H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Earth"></A>Earth Element</FONT></H4><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">In other words, the meditator contemplates all forms of matter that manifest in the whole body.

The element of motion is six-fold: motion upwards, downwards, in the intestines, in the abdomen, that which causes walking, standing, sitting, lying, bending, stretching, handling, etc., and motion produced by in-and-out breathing. The meditator can contemplate any aspect of this air-element. To note the activity of one’s body such as “walking,” “sitting,” or “lying down,” in accordance with the teaching of 
the Satipatthāna Sutta is to know the fifth aspect of the air-element. The practice of in-and-out breathing means contemplation of the air-element of the sixth kind. To note the rising and falling of the abdomen is to know the air-element that is in motion because of the pressure of the inhaled air. By noting thus the meditator knows the pressure of the inhaled air, so it can be said that he notes 
breathing in-and-out air. Some meditators may think that they should focus only on their nostril.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This is true if the aim is the attainment of absorption, which develops only if the mind is focused on a single object in one place. To attend to several objects in several places is bound to impede its 
development. However, this does not apply to insight meditation, which does not require the meditator to restrict his attention to a single place or a single object. Every phenomenon that arises from the six senses is a valid object of mindfulness. The Buddha says, “Sabbam abhiññeyam, Sabbam dhammam abhijānāti,” which means that the meditator should be mindful of everything, so in the practice of 
insight meditation there is no restriction as to the part of the physical body that is or is not to be noted. Just as upward motion, downward motion, abdominal motion, intestinal motion, and other motions in any place are worthy objects of contemplation, so is the motion of air breathed irrespective of any part of the body. In other words, the rising and falling indicate tension and motion in the abdomen and so to note them is to know the abdominal motion.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Mindfulness"></A>No Doubt About the Cultivation of Mindfulness</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">To note the rising and falling is to know the air-element in accordance with the Satipatthāna Sutta. It means noting the in-and-out breathing air-element, one of the six kinds of air-element that is apparent 
in the abdomen. This is also contemplation through bodily postures and clarity of consciousness.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Hence to note the rising or falling while sitting or to note, “sitting, sitting,” is to know the air-element and its behaviour. This is mindfulness of the body, and so is noting other forms of bodily activity such 
as bending, moving, walking, and so forth. Again, to note one’s feelings: “it is cramping”, “it is hot” “it is painful,” is mindfulness of feelings. To note every mental event whenever it occurs, imagining, thinking, intending, etc., is mindfulness of consciousness. To note seeing, hearing, etc., when these become especially manifest, is mindfulness of mental states.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Hence mindfulness of rising and falling and all other psychophysical phenomena at the moment of their 
occurrence is the right practice that accords with the teaching of the Satipattāna Sutta. There is no doubt about it. Yet those who do not fully understand the nature of insight meditation tend to be skeptical. Most of these skeptics are well-read and critical. Women have implicit faith in the meditation teachers and, by and large, they devote themselves to insight practice wholeheartedly. They easily 
attain tranquillity by virtue of their uncritical approach and unwavering faith. Tranquility is, of course, followed by insight and so it is not difficult for them to pass through successive stages of insight-knowledge. However, this is not true of every female meditator. There are those who do not make any progress because of their critical minds.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Some fail to attain insight because of their laxity, age, poor health, and lack of all-out effort. There are 
also meditators among laymen and bhikkhus who attain concentration and insight quickly by dint of systematic effort in accordance with instructions. It is easy to attain concentration if the meditator is convinced about the effectiveness of the insight method that we have mentioned above, and if he or she practises steadily and zealously.</FONT></P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="Temporary"></A>Purity of Mind Through Temporary Tranquillity</FONT>
</H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator should not harbour doubt and critical thinking, but should note and reject them. Equally important to note and reject are sensual desire, ill-will, torpor, and restlessness. In this way one will be free from doubt and other hindrances, and being always mindful, the mind will be pure. This is insight
-oriented temporary tranquillity that is on a par with access concentration. It may also be called access concentration because it is freed from hindrances. Hence in the Commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta, contemplation on bodily postures, clear comprehension, contemplations on the four elements, and other insight methods are described as access contemplation. Momentary concentration and access concentration ensure mental purity.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Hence the Buddha’s teaching: “Other people may have doubts about the true Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. However, we will overcome such doubts.” Thus you should practise effacement that lessens your defilements. You should affirm your will to overcome doubt by following the path of right view and right resolution. You should practise for your spiritual growth and put an end to the defilement of doubt by determination.</FONT></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0066" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><A NAME="OvercomingDoubt"></A>Overcoming Doubt by Insight and Path Knowledge</FONT></H3><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">Freedom from hindrances by itself will not enable us to overcome doubt. We should try to overcome it until it is uprooted on attainment of Stream-winning. Even after mental purity has been attained with 
the extinction of the hindrances we should keep on noting the rising and falling and other psychophysical phenomena. The meditator then discriminates between the object that is noted and the noting consciousness. He will note as he notes that the stiff, moving, and arising matter is one thing and the noting consciousness another. He will make the same distinction at the moment of sitting, bending, etc. In brief, the distinction between mind and matter will become apparent at every 
moment of mindfulness. The insight into such a distinction is called analytical knowledge of mind and matter.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">This knowledge is the basis of insight meditation so it is important to have it in its proper perspective. It is only after the independent, proper development of analytical knowledge of mind and matter during 
the practice of mindfulness, that the meditator makes progress and passes through the higher stages of insight. The distinction between mind and matter, which the meditator realises, is genuine. Originally it is impossible to distinguish between mind and matter. The two are closely bound up and do not lend themselves to intellectual analysis.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">For example, when you move your hand, you cannot differentiate its motion from the desire to move it. 
When you note and the distinction becomes clear, it is not possible to confuse one with the other. The noted matter and the noting consciousness remain sharply distinct. The distinction is borne in on you at every moment of noting and so is the non-existence of the living ego or soul apart from mind and matter. This is purity of view <I>(ditthivisuddhi).</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">As you keep on noting, you will realise the causal relationship between mind and matter. For example, 
your hands bend because of your desire to bend them; you have consciousness because there is an object for it, and so on. You reflect on the causal relation between defilements in your previous life and the manifestation of mind and matter such as rebirth-consciousness in your present life; the causal relation between the benefit and harm that you experience; your effort and hope for a fortunate life and the continuity of mind and matter in the future life. This insight into the conditioned 
nature of mind and matter is called “knowledge by discerning conditionality <I>(paccayapariggahañāna).</I> </FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator now discerns clearly that mind and matter is only conditional, or just mere cause and effect, and that there is no permanent soul or ego-entity that passes on from one life to another. This is purity by overcoming doubt <I>(kankhāvitaranavisuddhi).</I> With this purity, the meditator is free from all 
doubts such as “Did I exist in the past?” “Did I come into existence only in this life?” “Was I created by deities, Brahmās, or God?” “Will I continue to exist after my death?” etc. He or she is convinced of the cause and effect relation between one life and another and the non-existence of a living soul.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">The meditator should overcome doubt through this purity. Then he or she must continue noting. He or 
she will see the noted phenomenon arising and passing away. He or she realises the law of impermanence and the suffering of life that is unsatisfactory and undependable. He or she becomes aware, too, of the conditionality of everything. His or her awareness is not confined to mind and matter. It encompasses all the phenomena that arise from six senses. This kind of awareness is in accord with what the Buddha says: “Everything is to be analysed and known in terms of the three 
characteristics … <I>Sabbam pariññeyyam.”</I></FONT><I></I></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif">When such analytical insight-knowledge is complete, the meditator will, while noting the ceaseless arising and passing away of mind and matter, see the cessation of mental formations, that is nibbāna at the stage of Stream-winning. He or she cannot then have any doubt about the Buddha, Dhamma, 
and Sangha. Nor will he or she be skeptical about his or her practice, the past, the present, and the future of samsāra, or the conditionality of all phenomena. The meditator is then beyond all doubt. A meditator who is totally free from doubt is a Stream-winner, so you should overcome doubt at least on the Stream-winner level.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=720 NOF=LY><TR VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><TD WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=30><IMG
